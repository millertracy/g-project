At first i thought its normal then i realized how dumb my action is i should have go to their table and said goodbye rather than saying it from far away that make me look like a panic person, i keep on thinking about this case i think about how my aunt family think about me after my move and etc.\\\n",

But then I started to think what if I am not in control of my body anymore, and I will jump in the river or I want to go at to start fight some guy on the street and I will finish in jail because I will be aggressive or mby I will finish in mental hospital.. I started to to shake, my heart wanted to explode. And from then, now when I move my heart is beating really fast and I am afraid to get panic attack again. \\\n",

Sometimes I push myself to go a street or two nearby to where Im going so that I experience a new place and can then have that as somewhere Ive been before that I might be able to go again but I find that hard. Staying at home feels way less anxiety provoking. \\\n",

i have so what can anyone expect me to do im trying my best its so hard for others to understand the level of anxiety i have thats not a criticism at all just i had to go on the shop floor even though i wasnt comfortable and just felt i was dying with panic the other lady there was very nice but its pretty hard to understand my desperation had to keep escaping too many people around too close and i didnt want to be asked anything everything around me feels like a dream i just feel wrong so wrong bus back was manic attention was drawn to me for a second when the driver didnt stop long enough for me to get off i went back to my seat and didnt say anything it wasnt my fault he didnt stop obviously but im convinced i did something really really odd when people looked just horrible alone now

anxiety for years and had numerous therapies and treatments for it but no therapy has seemed to ever work i believe this is due to being undiagnosed with borderline personality disorder im waiting for an assessment which im more than 100 sure i have however ever since taking sertraline for the past 34 months i am happy to say that i am really starting to feel the positive effects socially   i am posting in this forum as i think the problem i am facing is more to do with sa and not bpd for years i have felt very odd at random times around family especially christmas im not extremely close to my family but we do get on i just sometimes feel a feeling i find very very difficult explain its almost as if i feel sick and feel like i dont belong at all it feels quite like im out of my own body more recently i have started to get it with friends because of the sertraline i have started taking part in things i never would before i have seen my friends and done things soberly through the day much more than i ever have but when im sober around my friends i just feel really weird its not awkward its just like i feel sick and shouldnt be around them and dont belong there i dont know if its maybe because im so used to not doing things with them that when i do i maybe just cant remember how it feels its weird because the people i am most close withi do not feel it at all like i feel like i belong with my boyfriend and i could be with him all the time but as soon as we have a family meal i just feel weird and sickly and perhaps quite child like like i almost feel like i shouldnt have a boyfriend around my family and when im with my friends i feel like i shouldnt be there with them because its not like me   ive never ever described this feeling to a doctor before because i simply cant explain it but it really is a horrible feeling and i cant shake it off at all it ends up really ruining my time and i just want to go home and be alone even if im having a nice time there also

was hospitalized a few years ag  and thats when they diagnosed me with bpd  but not they never gave me any special therapy they put me on medications which never seemed to help it either made me sick

listened  i feel like no one has ever taken me seriously and everything i do is just a cry for attention when really im really hurting and i cant stop hurting myself maybe it was my fault because i never told anyone what happened to me to when it happened i was scared and kept it bottled up for years until i didnt see a point anymore they got away with it and its my fault they did i dont think i can forgive myself for that   i dont know how to feel good and when i do feel happy it never last long and i always feel guilty and i dont deserve it smoking is the only way i can feel good and i know its not doing me any good really but i cant stop going a day without is the worst i find myself looking for crumbs and going out trying to find a way to get it and its bad i feel like ive made to many

did telling folks who didnt understand made me feel worse unadaptive to this world so many times felt like i really dont care if i just die didnt get to the point of taking my own life but certainly wont mind if something happen and i just died even felt like a relief the idea of just be done with everything i tried talking to my family and friends and no one seemed to get it everyone thinks that i just need to be strong get over it or im just over sensitive and dramatic it suffocates me what suffocates me more is that i feel like am completely alone and no matter what i say no one in my life  would ever understand i tried telling my girlfriend i bet she just thinks am exaggerating and being over sensitive since she didnt really give it much of attention or asked me about any of what i told her i guess she doesnt even wanna listen she simply doesnt believe it  im so sorry for what youre going through i know how hard this can be')])\n",

accused of a heinous crime of which i wont mention i was nfad about 2 weeks ago and was proven innocent since october 2016 ive slowly been becoming less and less social although i wasnt exactly confident growing up i was in foster care from 8 years old until i was 16 ran away early i have always been a shy lad but in the past year its gotten to the point where i dont leave the house anymore i probably go out once every few weeks i have been to my gp and am now taking 50mg sertraline for social anxiety i also smoke cannabis and have been since around december 2016 i know i need to kick this habit and i have tried infact at the time of writing i havent smoked anything so i guess its a start my family has a history of mental issues my sister has anxiety herself and my mother has severe depression and anxiety she leaves the house less than me and i hate it because i want her to enjoy life i think one of the reasons i cant motivate myself to go outside and actually do things is because my mum cant and i feel bad leaving her back here and me going out enjoying myself i am regularly invited to go out by my cousin and my best mate but 90 of the time i make excuses and i hate myself for it i used to go out with my step dad who i love as much as my mum every saturday and sunday and almost every other day of the week just doing odd things helping him with shopping etc but now i dont go with him anymore i think i went out around 3 weeks ago for 1 day said i was going to change myself and here i am again back at the beginning ive researched into how to motivate myself and how to get off my ass and actually do something but nothing works i hate the way my life is going and i just dont know how to fix it people have said to me in the past things like force yourself to go out and youll enjoy it but i dont i hate being around people especially people i dont know its the same reason i dont have a job i severely want one to fund myself and my family as were not exactly on the rich end of the spectrumin 2016 i did have an opportunity to do volunteer work had my step dad drive me there and i couldnt get out the car i was terrified of a volunteer job    i just

changed though  things have got worse very quickly  and im feeling completely and utterly unable to lead a normal life anymore  i hate being around people i cant go into the supermarket as i feel people are staring at me i cant speak to colleagues and sometimes even speaking to my mum is something id rather not do anymore  my job involves speaking to and meeting new people and im about to pack it in as i just cant do it anymore  i absolutely dread social events like parties or going to the pub etc and meeting and speaking to new people on a social level is just impossible these days  my husband plays in a band and going to watch him just fills me with dread as i know there will be lots of people there and ill be on my own  its hard to explain the way i feel  i wake up every morning

for about a week now  my husband is very supportive but bless him i really dont think he knows what to do  i dont know what to do either as i dont understand whats happening to me  i remember being around 6 or 7 years old and being branded as shy and growing up always left me feeling awkward and quiet  i really have no real friends as everyone ive made friends with in the past have just let me down or drifted away  people who i considered as friends have turned out really not to be who i thought they were so i tend to treat people with caution now and find it impossible to trust people and make friends  i spend all my weekends alone husband works and thats actually the way i like it  even when my husband is at home i tend to spend all my time in the bedroom alone reading or on the computer  ive reached a stage now that i really dont know what to do  i have zero social life other than when i go out with my husband its only him and i and i feel fine with that and all i do is work then come home and shut myself away from the world  i hate speaking to people  i hate being in public  i feel so nervous around people i dont know  i dont trust people easily  i feel like im going crazy  i havent enjoyed life for a while as i worry myself sick about everything  i sleep for only around three hours or so per night  i dont know why im like this as ive been told im a really caring person and id do anything for anyone  i guess i just want to be normal  i was recently made redundant from a job id done for years and with people who id known for years  im self employed now and finding things so hard  i miss the company from the job i used to do and the people i knew there  my husband is lovely and i look at him and wish i was as confident as him  he has lots of friends  hes introduced me to them on nights out but i just end up feeling awkward and stupid and boring   i feel like ive got nothing interesting to say and people think im ridiculous  im sorry about this post as i feel like i sound really sorry for myself  ive typed how i feel to see if anyone can determine what the hell is wrong with me  i just want to get on with my life  i want to be able to walk out the door of my house without wanting to run back in the minute i see someone else in the street  i want to feel as though im not going crazy  the only time i feel like a normal human being is when ive had

       "  'im pretty unhappy so im going to write down some stuff that just keeps swirling around in my head so itll probably end up being quite a long post as ive never really ever put anything down on paper sorry to anyone who ends up taking the time to read it but thank you aswell   just a little about me first of all im 18 12 years of age just a tad over 6 foot 4 just under 65 my weight has gone up and down roughly from 250lbs to about 260lbs since i was about 16 12 years old so its relatively constant ie i dont put on huge amounts of weight or lose it   i am overweight but i dont look like someone who is obese or extremely overweight whether this is due to my height and size carrying the weight a bit better im not too sure i am a big guy theres no denying it but its something im extremely self conscious about and tend to shy away from going outside to avoid being noticed wishing i didnt have such a presence and size as a result i tend to look nervous and have a bad posture in the company of other people just wanting the ground to swallow me up i think i have got an anxiety problem as i tend to feel really uncomfortable about going outside but ive never really had a panic attack    i was never a shy person and growing up from about the age of 13 to 1516 i never had any problems making friends talking to people and generally just enjoying my life and not worrying about insecurities in myself and facing judgement from others such as being overweight or anything like this yes i also know that being overweight isnt good but its the fact im not happy with who i am that i need to fix first of all before i can change such things as being overweight   aged 16 having left secondaryhigh school my life has really taken a turn for the worst and for the last 2 or so years since i left ive been constantly depressed hating everything about myself and my appearance and just feeling downright lonely and as though im not good enough to be in anyones life as their friend or even in a relationship    ive spent a lot of time just dwelling on what are seemingly small things such as imperfections in my outside appearance and even thinking that as a result im going to end up being some loner for the rest of my lifethis is something that genuinely scares me and i dont want to happen but with the way i feel now looks so far awaywhen i bare in mind that there are people in much worse situations than myself i tend to say pull yourself together and i do for the rest of the day then i slip back into self loathing and wishing i could just hide away the next day    as a result of how i feel ive spent alot of time at home not socialising very often and doing things with people apart from speaking on msn messenger and emails and in general just sitting around doing nothing but going on the internet    i have spent periods of the last 2 years doing various things ie a couple of full times jobs and also at college but every time ive started fine within weeks or months i just got to the point where i could not physically do it because i felt so low and not wanting to face doing such things anymore ive not felt suicidal but just havent wanted to leave my house or be in contact with anyone but my family    more recently in fact from about september 2009 ive been signed up to a 2 year college course and all was fine up until about february 2010 when i just couldnt carry on any longer i went to see my doctorgp about it and was advised that i needed to have a break out from college due to depression and i was put on one 20mg tablet of fluoxetine a day not too sure if thats the correct spelling i spoke with my tutor and he was fine with me taking a break and returning within 4 weeks i never did but my tutor was happy enough for me to complete work from home and email him the work i needed to do to complete the course    fortunately i havent had a problem getting this work done so the 1st year of my college course has been completed but this is where my dilemma really starts to get difficult as my tutor wants to know if i feel as though i can do the 2nd year at the college now i personally want too as i like the people in my class i find it interesting etc etc but i really dont know how i will react when the time comes to go back into class if i will be able to cope i have told him id like to go back but i am genuinely worried about the next year in my life   im mainly worried as my mum is permanently ill type 1 diabetic and suffers from me and my dad is her full time carer so money is not terribly easy to come by and things are tight my mum gets financial support for me being at college but due to me having a bad time in the last 2 years she is getting worried that she will lose the financial support she currently gets for me being taken off of my course    so i basically have two choices try and get through my course meanwhile with all the issues ive got still going unresolved in my own head making things worse but if i end up not being able to cope i really need to get a job as we cannot afford for me to be at home aswell with no income being generated   i just wish i could solve all of my problems and stop thinking and feeling the way i do as while they dont seem to be huge problems all added together they are literally ruining my life and stopping me from enjoying it    my family are supportive and they are also fully aware about how i feel and do help me as is my doctor and tutor but whilst i have felt better since ive been off sick from college with depression i cant see an end coming to where i will one day just be able to get up and be able to get on with my life in a way i can feel relatively comfortable with myself enough to enjoy and cope with it    my weight is also something that ive become almost obsessed with to the point where i feel desperate and helpless and have even seen myself googling answers for quick weight loss plans i dont eat bad or too much i just literally do not do anything i want to get up and do exercise but i genuinely dont want to leave the house with the way i feel so i end up getting depressed once again   i do realise it requires a lifestyle change to keep weight off but its just got me to the point where im so unhappy and down that i cant see any way i can change it wanting quick fixes is just literally ruining me as i dont ever really feel as though i can go outside   ive never ever thought of committing suicide as i do still want to do lots of things such as get married have a family get a decent job and see and do lots of things its just not something i can look forward too all the time i have such a severely low self esteem and confidence     im just getting really down once again and angry with myself that i cant seem to change how i feel and think and i dont want to feel sorry for myself or anything like that i just wish it would all go away   sorry if this seems really confusing and not in any particular order or even makes sense as i just typed as much as i could think of as to how im feeling   thanks to anyone who takes the time to read through my pitiful attempt at feeling sorry for myself\\n'])"

posting in this forum as i think the problem i am facing is more to do with sa and not bpd for years i have felt very odd at random times around family especially christmas im not extremely close to my family but we do get on i just sometimes feel a feeling i find very very difficult explain its almost as if i feel sick and feel like i dont belong at all it feels quite like im out of my own body more recently i have started to get it with friends because of the sertraline i have started taking part in things i never would before i have seen my friends and done things soberly through the day much more than i ever have but when im sober around my friends i just feel really weird its not awkward its just like i feel sick and shouldnt be around them and dont belong there i dont know if its maybe because im so used to not doing things with them that when i do i maybe just cant remember how it feels its weird because the people i am most close withi do not feel it at all like i feel like i belong with my boyfriend and i could be with him all the time but as soon as we have a family meal i just feel weird and sickly and perhaps quite child like like i almost feel like i shouldnt have a boyfriend around my family and when im with my friends i feel like i shouldnt be there with them because its not like me   ive never ever described this feeling to a doctor before because i simply cant explain it but it really is a horrible feeling and i cant shake it off at all it ends up really ruining my time and i just want to go home and be alone even if im having a nice time there also

was hospitalized a few years ag  and thats when they diagnosed me with bpd  but not they never gave me any special therapy they put me on medications which never seemed to help it either made me sick

listened  i feel like no one has ever taken me seriously and everything i do is just a cry for attention when really im really hurting and i cant stop hurting myself maybe it was my fault because i never told anyone what happened to me to when it happened i was scared and kept it bottled up for years until i didnt see a point anymore they got away with it and its my fault they did i dont think i can forgive myself for that   i dont know how to feel good and when i do feel happy it never last long and i always feel guilty and i dont deserve it smoking is the only way i can feel good and i know its not doing me any good really but i cant stop going a day without is the worst i find myself looking for crumbs and going out trying to find a way to get it and its bad i feel like ive made to many

did telling folks who didnt understand made me feel worse unadaptive to this world so many times felt like i really dont care if i just die didnt get to the point of taking my own life but certainly wont mind if something happen and i just died even felt like a relief the idea of just be done with everything i tried talking to my family and friends and no one seemed to get it everyone thinks that i just need to be strong get over it or im just over sensitive and dramatic it suffocates me what suffocates me more is that i feel like am completely alone and no matter what i say no one in my life  would ever understand i tried telling my girlfriend i bet she just thinks am exaggerating and being over sensitive since she didnt really give it much of attention or asked me about any of what i told

accused of a heinous crime of which i wont mention i was nfad about 2 weeks ago and was proven innocent since october 2016 ive slowly been becoming less and less social although i wasnt exactly confident growing up i was in foster care from 8 years old until i was 16 ran away early i have always been a shy lad but in the past year its gotten to the point where i dont leave the house anymore i probably go out once every few weeks i have been to my gp and am now taking 50mg sertraline for social anxiety i also smoke cannabis and have been since around december 2016 i know i need to kick this habit and i have tried infact at the time of writing i havent smoked anything so i guess its a start my family has a history of mental issues my sister has anxiety herself and my mother has severe depression and anxiety she leaves the house less than me and i hate it because i want her to enjoy life i think one of the reasons i cant motivate myself to go outside and actually do things is because my mum cant and i feel bad leaving her back here and me going out enjoying myself i am regularly invited to go out by my cousin and my best mate but 90 of the time i make excuses and i hate myself for it i used to go out with my step dad who i love as much as my mum every saturday and sunday and almost every other day of the week just doing odd things helping him with shopping etc but now i dont go with him anymore i think i went out around 3 weeks ago for 1 day said i was going to change myself and here i am again back at the beginning ive researched into how to motivate myself and how to get off my ass and actually do something but nothing works i hate the way my life is going and i just dont know how to fix it people have said to me in the past things like force yourself to go out and youll enjoy it but i dont i hate being around people especially people i dont know its the same reason i dont have a job i severely want one to fund myself and my family as were not exactly on the rich end of the spectrumin 2016 i did have an opportunity to do volunteer work had my step dad drive me there and i couldnt get out the car i was terrified of a volunteer job    i just

i guess im hoping someone can help me out please  for years ive been suffering from very low selfesteem and i feel generally awkward in the company of people i dont know  some days even leaving my house can be a huge challenge and when i do i cant wait to get back home  the last few months something has changed though  things have got worse very quickly  and im feeling completely and utterly unable to lead a normal life anymore  i hate being around people i cant go into the supermarket as i feel people are staring at me i cant speak to colleagues and sometimes even speaking to my mum is something id rather not do anymore  my job involves speaking to and meeting new people and im about to pack it in as i just cant do it anymore  i absolutely dread social events like parties or going to the pub etc and meeting and speaking to new people on a social level is just impossible these days  my husband plays in a band and going to watch him just fills me with dread as i know there will be lots of people there and ill be on my own  its hard to explain the way i feel  i wake up every morning thinking and hoping ill feel better and that all these silly feelings will disappear but they dont  in the past ive felt like this for a few days then it goes but this time ive been feeling like this for about a week now  my husband is very supportive but bless him i really dont think he knows what to do  i dont know what to do either as i dont understand whats happening to me  i remember being around 6 or 7 years old and being branded as shy and growing up always left me feeling awkward and quiet  i really have no real friends as everyone ive made friends with in the past have just let me down or drifted away  people who i considered as friends have turned out really not to be who i thought they were so i tend to treat people with caution now and find it impossible to trust people and make friends  i spend all my weekends alone husband works and thats actually the way i like it  even when my husband is at home i tend to spend all my time in the bedroom alone reading or on the computer  ive reached a stage now that i really dont know what to do  i have zero social life other than when i go out with my husband its only him and i and i feel fine with that and all i do is work then come home and shut myself away from the world  i hate speaking to people  i hate being in public  i feel so nervous around people i dont know  i dont trust people easily  i feel like im going crazy  i havent enjoyed life for a while as i worry myself sick about everything  i sleep for only around three hours or so per night  i dont know why im like this as ive been told im a really caring person and id do anything for anyone  i guess i just want to be normal  i was recently made redundant from a job id done for years and with people who id known for years  im self employed now and finding things so hard  i miss the company from the job i used to do and the people i knew there  my husband is lovely and i look at him and wish i was as confident as him  he has lots of friends  hes introduced me to them on nights out but i just end up feeling awkward and stupid and boring   i feel like ive got nothing interesting to say and people think im ridiculous  im sorry about this post as i feel like i sound really sorry for myself  ive typed how i feel to see if anyone can determine what the hell is wrong with me  i just want to get on with my life  i want to be able to walk out the door of my house without wanting to run back in the minute i see someone else in the street  i want to feel as though im not going crazy  the only time i feel like a normal human being is when ive had a few glasses of wine  i know this isnt a good thing as i cant spend the rest of my

job i left school after year 11 and that was 4 years ago ive been struggling to find a job ever since but no one will give me the time of day and i know its because they can see i have low confidence and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (159389, 'im pretty unhappy so im going to write down some stuff that just keeps swirling around in my head so itll probably end up being quite a long post as ive never really ever put anything down on paper sorry to anyone who ends up taking the time to read it but thank you aswell   just a little about me first of all im 18 12 years of age just a tad over 6 foot 4 just under 65 my weight has gone up and down roughly from 250lbs to about 260lbs since i was about 16 12 years old so its relatively constant ie i dont put on huge amounts of weight or lose it   i am overweight but i dont look like someone who is obese or extremely overweight whether this is due to my height and size carrying the weight a bit better im not too sure i am a big guy theres no denying it but its something im extremely self conscious about and tend to shy away from going outside to avoid being noticed wishing i didnt have such a presence and size as a result i tend to look nervous and have a bad posture in the company of other people just wanting the ground to swallow me up i think i have got an anxiety problem as i tend to feel really uncomfortable about going outside but ive never really had a panic attack    i was never a shy person and growing up from about the age of 13 to 1516 i never had any problems making friends talking to people and generally just enjoying my life and not worrying about insecurities in myself and facing judgement from others such as being overweight or anything like this yes i also know that being overweight isnt good but its the fact im not happy with who i am that i need to fix first of all before i can change such things as being overweight   aged 16 having left secondaryhigh school my life has really taken a turn for the worst and for the last 2 or so years since i left ive been constantly depressed hating everything about myself and my appearance and just feeling downright lonely and as though im not good enough to be in anyones life as their friend or even in a relationship    ive spent a lot of time just dwelling on what are seemingly small things such as imperfections in my outside appearance and even thinking that as a result im going to end up being some loner for the rest of my lifethis is something that genuinely scares me and i dont want to happen but with the way i feel now looks so far awaywhen i bare in mind that there are people in much worse situations than myself i tend to say pull yourself together and i do for the rest of the day then i slip back into self loathing and wishing i could just hide away the next day    as a result of how i feel ive spent alot of time at home not socialising very often and doing things with people apart from speaking on msn messenger and emails and in general just sitting around doing nothing but going on the internet    i have spent periods of the last 2 years doing various things ie a couple of full times jobs and also at college but every time ive started fine within weeks or months i just got to the point where i could not physically do it because i felt so low and not wanting to face doing such things anymore ive not felt suicidal but just havent wanted to leave my house or be in contact with anyone but my family    more recently in fact from about september 2009 ive been signed up to a 2 year college course and all was fine up until about february 2010 when i just couldnt carry on any longer i went to see my doctorgp about it and was advised that i needed to have a break out from college due to depression and i was put on one 20mg tablet of fluoxetine a day not too sure if thats the correct spelling i spoke with my tutor and he was fine with me taking a break and returning within 4 weeks i never did but my tutor was happy enough for me to complete work from home and email him the work i needed to do to complete the course    fortunately i havent had a problem getting this work done so the 1st year of my college course has been completed but this is where my dilemma really starts to get difficult as my tutor wants to know if i feel as though i can do the 2nd year at the college now i personally want too as i like the people in my class i find it interesting etc etc but i really dont know how i will react when the time comes to go back into class if i will be able to cope i have told him id like to go back but i am genuinely worried about the next year in my life   im mainly worried as my mum is permanently ill type 1 diabetic and suffers from me and my dad is her full time carer so money is not terribly easy to come by and things are tight my mum gets financial support for me being at college but due to me having a bad time in the last 2 years she is getting worried that she will lose the financial support she currently gets for me being taken off of my course    so i basically have two choices try and get through my course meanwhile with all the issues ive got still going unresolved in my own head making things worse but if i end up not being able to cope i really need to get a job as we cannot afford for me to be at home aswell with no income being generated   i just wish i could solve all of my problems and stop thinking and feeling the way i do as while they dont seem to be huge problems all added together they are literally ruining my life and stopping me from enjoying it    my family are supportive and they are also fully aware about how i feel and do help me as is my doctor and tutor but whilst i have felt better since ive been off sick from college with depression i cant see an end coming to where i will one day just be able to get up and be able to get on with my life in a way i can feel relatively comfortable with myself enough to enjoy and cope with it    my weight is also something that ive become almost obsessed with to the point where i feel desperate and helpless and have even seen myself googling answers for quick weight loss plans i dont eat bad or too much i just literally do not do anything i want to get up and do exercise but i genuinely dont want to leave the house with the way i feel so i end up getting depressed once again   i do realise it requires a lifestyle change to keep weight off but its just got me to the point where im so unhappy and down that i cant see any way i can change it wanting quick fixes is just literally ruining me as i dont ever really feel as though i can go outside   ive never ever thought of committing suicide as i do still want to do lots of things such as get married have a family get a decent job and see and do lots of things its just not something i can look forward too all the time i have such a severely low self esteem and confidence     im just getting really down once again and angry with myself that i cant seem to change how i feel and think and i dont want to feel sorry for myself or anything like that i just wish it would all go away   sorry if this seems really confusing and not in any particular order or even makes sense as i just typed as much as i could think of as to how im feeling   thanks to anyone who takes the time to read through my pitiful attempt at feeling sorry for myself')])\n",

      "((1588361, 'hey guys my name is marky im 20 years old and i think i need some advice its gonna be a long one so sorry about that   im gonna start from the beginning in october 2016 i was accused of a heinous crime of which i wont mention i was nfad about 2 weeks ago and was proven innocent since october 2016 ive slowly been becoming less and less social although i wasnt exactly confident growing up i was in foster care from 8 years old until i was 16 ran away early i have always been a shy lad but in the past year its gotten to the point where i dont leave the house anymore i probably go out once every few weeks i have been to my gp and am now taking 50mg sertraline for social anxiety i also smoke cannabis and have been since around december 2016 i know i need to kick this habit and i have tried infact at the time of writing i havent smoked anything so i guess its a start my family has a history of mental issues my sister has anxiety herself and my mother has severe depression and anxiety she leaves the house less than me and i hate it because i want her to enjoy life i think one of the reasons i cant motivate myself to go outside and actually do things is because my mum cant and i feel bad leaving her back here and me going out enjoying myself i am regularly invited to go out by my cousin and my best mate but 90 of the time i make excuses and i hate myself for it i used to go out with my step dad who i love as much as my mum every saturday and sunday and almost every other day of the week just doing odd things helping him with shopping etc but now i dont go with him anymore i think i went out around 3 weeks ago for 1 day said i was going to change myself and here i am again back at the beginning ive researched into how to motivate myself and how to get off my ass and actually do something but nothing works i hate the way my life is going and i just dont know how to fix it people have said to me in the past things like force yourself to go out and youll enjoy it but i dont i hate being around people especially people i dont know its the same reason i dont have a job i severely want one to fund myself and my family as were not exactly on the rich end of the spectrumin 2016 i did have an opportunity to do volunteer work had my step dad drive me there and i couldnt get out the car i was terrified of a volunteer job    i just dont know what to do ive been on the sertraline for probably 23 months and although ive felt a slight increase in my mood i still havent the motivation to do anything'), [(361046, 'im new to this and i guess im hoping someone can help me out please  for years ive been suffering from very low selfesteem and i feel generally awkward in the company of people i dont know  some days even leaving my house can be a huge challenge and when i do i cant wait to get back home  the last few months something has changed though  things have got worse very quickly  and im feeling completely and utterly unable to lead a normal life anymore  i hate being around people i cant go into the supermarket as i feel people are staring at me i cant speak to colleagues and sometimes even speaking to my mum is something id rather not do anymore  my job involves speaking to and meeting new people and im about to pack it in as i just cant do it anymore  i absolutely dread social events like parties or going to the pub etc and meeting and speaking to new people on a social level is just impossible these days  my husband plays in a band and going to watch him just fills me with dread as i know there will be lots of people there and ill be on my own  its hard to explain the way i feel  i wake up every morning thinking and hoping ill feel better and that all these silly feelings will disappear but they dont  in the past ive felt like this for a few days then it goes but this time ive been feeling like this for about a week now  my husband is very supportive but bless him i really dont think he knows what to do  i dont know what to do either as i dont understand whats happening to me  i remember being around 6 or 7 years old and being branded as shy and growing up always left me feeling awkward and quiet  i really have no real friends as everyone ive made friends with in the past have just let me down or drifted away  people who i considered as friends have turned out really not to be who i thought they were so i tend to treat people with caution now and find it impossible to trust people and make friends  i spend all my weekends alone husband works and thats actually the way i like it  even when my husband is at home i tend to spend all my time in the bedroom alone reading or on the computer  ive reached a stage now that i really dont know what to do  i have zero social life other than when i go out with my husband its only him and i and i feel fine with that and all i do is work then come home and shut myself away from the world  i hate speaking to people  i hate being in public  i feel so nervous around people i dont know  i dont trust people easily  i feel like im going crazy  i havent enjoyed life for a while as i worry myself sick about everything  i sleep for only around three hours or so per night  i dont know why im like this as ive been told im a really caring person and id do anything for anyone  i guess i just want to be normal  i was recently made redundant from a job id done for years and with people who id known for years  im self employed now and finding things so hard  i miss the company from the job i used to do and the people i knew there  my husband is lovely and i look at him and wish i was as confident as him  he has lots of friends  hes introduced me to them on nights out but i just end up feeling awkward and stupid and boring   i feel like ive got nothing interesting to say and people think im ridiculous  im sorry about this post as i feel like i sound really sorry for myself  ive typed how i feel to see if anyone can determine what the hell is wrong with me  i just want to get on with my life  i want to be able to walk out the door of my house without wanting to run back in the minute i see someone else in the street  i want to feel as though im not going crazy  the only time i feel like a normal human being is when ive had a few glasses of wine  i know this isnt a good thing as i cant spend the rest of my life being drunk just to fit in  thanks for reading this'), (1064658, 'hi just joined today   im a 20 year old female and ive had severe social anxiety for as long as i can remember its so bad its gotten to the point where i cant even answer my phone because i dont want to talk to anyone i dont like going to family gatherings i dont like being around people at all ive never been able to get a job i left school after year 11 and that was 4 years ago ive been struggling to find a job ever since but no one will give me the time of day and i know its because they can see i have low confidence and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (1025867, 'i havent told anybody about the self harming because its embarrasing  i havent told anybody about wanting to kill myself because my step brother tried to kill himself so anything other than the act itself is being an attention seeker apparently  also whats the famous saying dont tell anybody your problems because 80 of people dont care and the other 20 are glad you have them  i dont want to tell people about it  im embarrased by it i still want to do it though  all i wanted to know was what was wrong with me to put a name to a condition because im certain i have something with the things im thinking  i hate the way i look i hate the way im perceived i always think people are judging me in a negative way i hate how people are rude  even though id consider myself mild mannered recently ive been thinking of hurting people who i perceive as rude i wanted to get pinnoplasty surgery but i cant afford it i dont like socialising outside of work  football because i feel people are juding me or are going to mock me  put me on the spot i have been into town or socialising maybe 3 times in 8 years as a result ive lost my friends that i had and on top of that i dont date because i dont like going out i use to have ocd querks washing hands symmetry repetitions but i dont anymore i think about suicide alot i hate the idea of growing old and i constantly think to myself this has happened it will never happen again for example going to primary school on my first day etc i also hate growing old because i feel like people think you should be married by 28 have kids by 30 etc when i  speak id say im perceived as energetic and hyper  talkative but by the end of the day or sometimes minutes later i feel low again   i also hate when people say suicide is selfish  selfish is expecting me to hang around even though i hate my life so that other people dont have to feel bad or sad because i killed myself people seem to think that we should be content just being alive i cant wait to hang around and watch the only people in the world i have die of a heart attack old age')])\n",

gotten to the point where i cant even answer my phone because i dont want to talk to anyone i dont like going to family gatherings i dont like being around people at all ive never been able to get a job i left school after year 11 and that was 4 years ago ive been struggling to find a job ever since but no one will give me the time of day and i know its because they can see i have low confidence and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (306265, 'im 22 and i havent left my house for social reasons for about 2 years this is the first time ive spoken about myself in this way and im not sure exactly what im expecting to get out of it but i just felt like i should let something out and see what exactly that is im just going to type as things come to my head so my apologies if its hard work reading or if i come accross as an illiterate moron  although my  social anxiety has gotten me very depressed in the past my worst point was about 6months ago when i began planning suicide which i am past now ive always dealt with it but its getting alot worse and its just got to the point where i just want to sort my life out before its too late at 22 im yet to kiss a girl im not a bad looking guy and im in good health my appearance is definately not the problem the fact that im totally shit scared of social encounters is i guess im lonely i have so much love to give and yearn the same its not only that i have sa to deal with but the knock on effects of 2 years of depression aswell my enthusiasm has been drained out of me over time i have the motivation to do nothing nothing interests me and i find myself hating everything around me ive become such a sad bitter person and i hate it i just want to be happy and let the good person i am shine ive lost contact with all my friends from school which is probably a good thing since their idiots like 90 of people around my age with their moronic boozing lifestyles and pointless fb bullshit the thing is i just dont seem to connect with other people my age that well they all seem so simple maybe i just havent met the right people maybe im not looking in the right places either way its all pointless when i cant step out my house to meet those people anyway the fact is im not enjoying my life and its slowly slipping away from me since deciding suicide definately isnt an option i feel so trapped i dont see anyway of dealing with my problem lately i have been breaking down into tears out of sheer fustration that i cant get what i want out of life purely because i cannot function in social environments if i had the balls to just step out of my house for anything other than work my life would be so much better but i just cant do it im 22 im in good health im not a bad looking guy im smart i have a nice family i havent experienced anything traumatic i have a good job that pays well enough and sometimes i even enjoy i shouldnt be this unhappy nor do i deserve to be this unhappy when theres people in far worse situations than me    like i said im not sure what exactly im expecting to get out of posting this its a new experience for me i guess i just want to see what kind of advice people offer and their reactions to my situation

posting in this forum as i think the problem i am facing is more to do with sa and not bpd for years i have felt very odd at random times around family especially christmas im not extremely close to my family but we do get on i just sometimes feel a feeling i find very very difficult explain its almost as if i feel sick and feel like i dont belong at all it feels quite like im out of my own body

maybe because im so used to not doing things with them that when i do i maybe just cant remember how it feels its weird because the people i am most close withi do not feel it at all like i feel like i belong with my boyfriend and i could be with him all the time but as soon as we have a family meal i just feel weird and sickly and perhaps quite child like like i almost feel like i shouldnt have a boyfriend around my family and when im with my friends i feel like i shouldnt be there with them because its not like me   ive never ever described this feeling to a doctor before because i simply cant explain it but it really is a horrible feeling and i cant shake it off at all it ends up really ruining my time and i just want to go home and be alone even if im having a nice time there also

and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (306265, 'im 22 and i havent left my house for social reasons for about 2 years this is the first time ive spoken about myself in this way and im not sure exactly what im expecting to get out of it but i just felt like i should let something out and see what exactly that is im just going to type as things come to my head so my apologies if its hard work reading or if i come accross as an illiterate moron  although my  social anxiety has gotten me very depressed in the past my worst point was about 6months ago when i began planning suicide which i am past now ive always dealt with it but its getting alot worse and its just got to the point where i just want to sort my life out before its too late at 22 im yet to kiss a girl im not a bad looking guy and im in good health my appearance is definately not the problem the fact that im totally shit scared of social encounters is i guess im lonely i have so much love to give and yearn the same its not only that i have sa to deal with but the knock on effects of 2 years of depression aswell my enthusiasm has been drained out of me over time i have the motivation to do nothing nothing interests me and i find myself hating everything around me ive become such a sad bitter person and i hate it i just want to be happy and let the good person i am shine ive lost contact with all my friends from school which is probably a good thing since their idiots like 90 of people around my age with their moronic boozing lifestyles and pointless fb bullshit the thing is i just dont seem to connect with other people my age that well they all seem so simple maybe i just havent met the right people maybe im not looking in the right places either way its all pointless when i cant step out my house to meet those people anyway the fact is im not enjoying my life and its slowly slipping away from me since deciding suicide definately isnt an option i feel so trapped i dont see anyway of dealing with my problem lately i have been breaking down into tears out of sheer fustration that i cant get what i want out of life purely because i cannot function in social environments if i had the balls to just step out of my house for anything other than work my life would be so much better but i just cant do it im 22 im in good health im not a bad looking guy im smart i have a nice family i havent experienced anything traumatic i have a good job that pays well enough and sometimes i even enjoy i shouldnt be this unhappy nor do i deserve to be this unhappy when theres people in far worse situations than me    like i said im not sure what exactly im expecting to get out of posting this its a new experience for me i guess i just want to see what kind of advice people offer and their reactions to my situation   thanks')])\n",

like feeling on and off during the day too   i have no real friends and dont socialise at all really except going out with my husband for meal every now and then  i have people i talk to like round the school when i take my children to school but really struggle thinking of things to talk about and generally feel uncomfortable and like i just want to be alone so i dont have to talk to anyone i hang around after so i dont have to walk home with these people too as i just dont know what to say   i hate being like it but always worry about what they think about me and that they will talk about me behind my back   i hate being in situations with lots of people like at parties or work and currently work as a cleaner so i dont have to interact with others and feel uncomfortable but this isnt the job i want to do i would love to be a midwife but all the interaction with people puts me off doing it and would have to go university too which i just keep thinking they will never accept me anyway   i even feel uncomfortable with my family i have a big family 4 brothers  3 sisters and even feel then that i dont want to be around them when they are all together   i hate feeling like this

them situations i feel i cantwont speak to anyone and just want to leave after a short amount of time   i also have this huge fear of people dying especially my parents and worry pretty much every time the phone rings that it is going to be the bad news that one of them has died   i also worry about me dying and not being there to see my children grow up i have 3 children aged 1 2  6 and even my eldest daughter recently has been asking questions and getting upset about dying and asking if i will still be here when shes old   i also go through thinkingwhat happens when im dead where will i be i wont be alive i wont be living so what happens after it really freaks me out and i have to force myself to think about other things cos it scares me so much   i dont know if this is all just

from very low selfesteem and i feel generally awkward in the company of people i dont know  some days even leaving my house can be a huge challenge and when i do i cant wait to get back home  the last few months something has changed though  things have got worse very quickly  and im feeling completely and utterly unable to lead a normal life anymore  i hate being around people i cant go into the supermarket as i feel people are staring at me i cant speak to colleagues and sometimes even speaking to my mum is something id rather not do anymore  my job involves speaking to and meeting new people and im about to pack it in as i just cant do it anymore  i absolutely dread social events like parties or going to the pub etc and meeting and speaking to new people on a social level is just impossible these days  my husband plays in a band and going to watch him just fills me with dread as i know there will be lots of people there and ill be on my own  its hard to explain the way i feel  i wake up every morning thinking and hoping ill feel better and that all these silly feelings will disappear but they dont  in the past ive felt like this for a few days then it goes but this time ive been feeling like this for about a week now  my husband is very supportive but bless him i really dont think he knows what to do  i dont know what to do either as i dont understand whats happening to me  i remember being around 6 or 7 years old and being branded as shy and growing up always left me feeling awkward and quiet  i really have no real friends as everyone ive made friends with in the past have just let me down or drifted away  people who i considered as friends have turned out really not to be who i thought they were so i tend to treat people with caution now and find it impossible to trust people and make friends  i spend all my weekends alone husband works and thats actually the way i like it  even when my husband is at home i tend to spend all my time in the bedroom alone reading or on the computer  ive reached a stage now that i really dont know what to do  i have zero social life other than when i go out with my husband its only him and i and i feel fine with that and all i do is work then come home and shut myself away from the world  i hate speaking to people  i hate being in public  i feel so nervous around people i dont know  i dont trust people easily  i feel like im going crazy  i havent enjoyed life for a while as i worry myself sick about everything  i sleep for only around three hours or so per night  i dont know why im like this as ive been told im a really caring person and id do anything for anyone  i guess i just want to be normal  i was recently made redundant from a job id done for years and with people who id known for years  im self employed now and finding things so hard  i miss the company from the job i used to do and the people i knew there  my husband is lovely and i look at him and wish i was as confident as him  he has lots of friends  hes introduced me to them on nights out but i just end up feeling awkward and stupid and boring   i feel like ive got nothing interesting to say and people think im

feeling very anxious and my heart was pounding in my chest and earsi felt like i might pass out so i sat down and tried to slow my breathing downit was hard my heart jump kept banging and it felt awful i took a xanax and started to calm down does this sound like a panic attack or just extreme anxiety----------', '1336348:okay so a few months ago i started taking prozac for premenstrual and anxiety control instead of controlling it though it gave me a ton of new symptoms like panic attacks that come out of nowhere at night and being jumpy at almost anything i stopped taking them after a few weeks and the panic attacks and jumpiness eventually died down so i thought i was through with those symptoms  fast forward a few months and ive started getting panic attacks again ive just started my fmp at college so thats most definitely the reason i cant get to sleep at night cuz it just keeps feeling like im going to die and that my hearts stopped beating i keep feeling that im going to completely black out and that im losing my breath im losing out on a load of sleep cuz of this and its really scary also it seems that the prozac symptoms are now a permanent thing fantastic  the jumpiness seems to be under control right now though  ive never had panic attacks before so i have no idea how best to deal with them ive tried reasoning with myself that im not dying and that im perfectly healthy but its not working very well ive tried distracting myself with games drawing and colouring books but im just so tired that i cant bring myself to do any of it and they dont seem to stop the attacks anyway music doesnt seem to work either in the end i just fall asleep and theyre better in the morning but still  i can just about deal with everyday anxiety stuff but this is new and i really have no idea what to do i know that if i deal with the stress the panic attacks will lessen and thats doable but i have no strategy for when they actually happen  does anyone have any idea about how to deal with this im really exhausted and stressed at the moment and i just want it all to go back to normal  also i dont want to take any more meds for it prozac put me right off----------', '63189:hello there im a 23 almost 24 year old man from london  i have been suffering from panic disorder chronic anxiety and hypercondria for over 6 years i remember my first panic attack like it was yesterday sitting at a bus stop out of nowhere thought i was dying felt like all my organs were failing one after the other  so much time has gone by and i wish i could say im better but im not  ive been on chlomipramine for the past 4 years its done me well but in the past month alone ive gone back up from 30mg to 60mg just to numb the anxiety   i have diazepam prescribed and i use it only when the panic attacks get so much that i cant take it anymore  my doctors just throw pills at me i saw a councilor years back but i didnt find cognitive therapy any help whatsoever and i really did try  im reaching the end of my tether i cant function properly im having panic attacks from half an hour after i wake up until i go to sleep apart from the time when im doped up on 4mg of diazepam even then the anxiety is there i just dont have insane panic attacks  i dunno where to go anymore what to do my girlfriend is so helpful but she cant do everything for me anymore she works hard enough i dont want to put it on her i havent even told her how bad its gotten recently i try to stay positive at the end of the day if i get depressed about it its going to get worse so i fight it put on a front if need be anything ive tried exercising getting fit crying to relieve the stress drinking alchohol to relieve it nothings working anymore all my old tricks of numbing it and yes running away from the problem have stopped working   so now its just panic all day every day  im starting to want to die just to stop the anxiety   my anxiety is all about my health i always think im going to have a heart attack or something i am extremely unfit 15mins on a crosstrainer in the gym and im spent and thats at a walking pace  i want to try and get fit so i can feel better maybe that would help but how can i do that if as soon as my heartbeat raises the tinyest bit i go into a fit of panic  i smoke ciggarettes i tried to quit but believe it or not i started to panic at the feeling of withdrawalstupid eh  i rarely go out i cant get a job or hold one down cos i just end up panicking the whole day  im a complete mess  im intelligent and i have strong willpower but i cant do it anymore the will to want to live is going and the panic is getting worse  my doctors are being useless ive contacted the mental health charity mind and heard nothing back   also something that has really gotten to me recently is that when i look in the mirror looking into my own eyes scares the hell out of me  it can cause a panic attack in an instant i dont understand it at all  does anyone else know of this kind of thing   any help is greatly appreciated----------']\n",

fear of losing control of themselves and not being able to find a safe place to escape to other people may have different reasons also like sensory issues being overstimulated selective mutism etc   i often cannot muster up the strength to go outside even if i need to i always get lifts off people as walking down roads where there is oncoming traffic and large vehicles makes me feel like i will collapse or i want to run away and hide a lot of the time it is because i dont like how unpredictable people are and feel emotionally drained at the thought of adapting to social type situations i

believe it is a fact my thoughts feel like they change completely very quickly and i am overwhelmed with multiple feelings like fear anxiety depression amusement and desperation all at the same time what is wrong with me i feel like i am the only thing that exists i feel like i am alone even though people are all around me----------', '5688703:well i will start off by saying i am a 38 year old female who lives by myself along with 2 dogs and 1 cat i have been living alone for 5 years now and have found my anxiety getting worse each year i used to be a very outgoing friendly happy person and now i am so insecure filled with worry and guilt and am so nervous to be around people because of what they may think of me and my life i literally have 1 girlfriend and i have known her for 24 years unfortunately over the years i have distanced myself from her because i feel i cant relate to her anymore she is married and has children i am divorced with no children i think in a way i distanced myself because i am jealous of her life ive always wanted a family and a home i currently have a boyfriend of 2 years now however the situation isnt really ideal for anyone he is currently married but they live in same house different rooms they are coparenting for the children while i love him to death i dont know if i am with him because i love him because i am lonely because i really want to be with someone because i like to punish myself or because i am just that messed up and think its what i deserve i have really had some abusive relationships in my life its seems to be what i attract he is not abusive at all he treats me very well but i want him to move out and finalize a divorce and we argue about it often this relationship goes along with this anxiety because truthfully i am a secret no one gets to know me in his family i currently work in a very customer service job i am a pit boss at a casino this job forces me to talk to people sometimes have uncomfortable conversations with them i supervise people and i am very outgoing however everyone thinks i am always angry because of the look on my face i dont smile when i am not talking to people aka resting bi face the truth is i am just nervous i dont want people to judge me im over weight and do not like how i look or feel about myself and i feel everyone else thinks just like i do the funny thing is once my shift gets going i forget all about the anxiety i dont know if its the business that takes the thoughts away from it or what but when the night slows down it all comes rushing back i find myself sitting alone in our employee dining room even though there are 50 people in there at most times i feel like i dont know how to converse with people and sometimes i feel like  are these people really that stupid thinking like that is really bad i dont feel i am smarter than people but i feel like i have way more common sense than some and unfortunately i feel like i talk to people like they are stupid and that is not my intention at all i try to talk so they come up with the right answer on their own while being guided and realizing just how little effort it takes to think a few more minutes and come up with the answer on their own but it comes out all wrong the anxiety then takes over my whole being and i just want to run far away sometimes i feel like im not myself when im at work like i get to be someone else the guests there dont know my personal life they dont know what ive been through so they just get to see happy me this anxiety isnt just work and friend related it is at its worst when attending family functions i really do not associate with family i cant breathe when i am around them i have been in my apartment for 5 years and i have never had them over i have 2 sisters and a father that live 1520 min from me and they have never seen my place i dont know what it is that freaks me out or triggers it i just wish it would go away and i could have my life back its pretty lonely being 38 and having no friends any suggestions----------']\n",

from my childhood what people said or just people or happenings that has no relevance to the present i have used the internet to build connections with friends and girls     there i have no problems at all to have conversations say what i feel  internet dating has never been a problem for me it is just that i have not been able to meet up with girls since my fears and symptoms of social anxiety his me i doubt of myself a lot even if people say im good enough im talented enough i have this perfectionist thinking and i dont like criticismi get very defensive then i want everything to be right at once im not sure if this is a part of social anxiety but i have never taken part of any side when there is an argument or if someone asks for an opinion im just neutral and blank in my head     then when someone says something or brings up his opinion i think that wait i could have said that i feel that this all life of daydreaming and fantasizing is a symptom of add people have told me im a bad  not sure if this is a sign of add or short attention i always think my jokes are the funniest and what i say i have hard time remembering things since im so up in the clouds i have always been a creative person and producing music has been a big part of life when i socialize with new people or friends i constantly think of things from the past and i cant be in the moment     seems i cant form new toughts at all or have any conversations in the present i hate taking advice from others i am very stubborn and sometimes i can get angry if someone points something out to me or suggest me anything i just tell them that everything is fine as it is and i dont need that i have recently opened up for my family more told things they did not knew about   currently everything has become worse and my obsessive thinking about past career and women and lost love i cant recognize myself and i dont have energy to meet up with friends or anyone i feel apathic people have told me that im more quieter than usual or that im so quiet but i just dont care when they make such remarks     i dont feel affected i cant feel emotions maybe it is because i never had a relationship with a women that has made me feel like this i wake up same time ever night sometimes and i dream a lot i put down my big hobbies in life slowly it has been harder to go on with no love this social anxiety and obsessive thinking is stopping me of be in the present with people before a social meeting i feel good and imagine in my head how i will be when the situation arrives i get blank in my head forget things i should say and after the social situation i remember what i have should said or done im usaly more open if the other person is taking initiative sometimes same thoughts  music gets stuck in my head for weeks i even tell the same jokes or say the same things i am very nice to other people helping them but when someone asks how i feel i just say that i feel great and deep inside i feel that it is not what i feel  reply with quote-----']\n",

       " 'hi   i need some advice im slowly learning to use cbt to overcome my anxiety i have to use self help for various reasons i have a really hard time with a few particular automatic thoughts that just dont go away and unfortunately they are directed towards recovery   i have thoughts like this is never going to work i will have anxiety forever im a loser see look i feel anxious two therapists gave up on me why will i do any better i cant control my thoughts   annoyingly cbt seems to cause me to have really persistent ants and because these thoughts act against the cbt they make it really hard its like a vicious cycle i can rationalise some ants when i do a mood journal but these ants then pop up ive tried rationalising them but it gets worse and then i go into full blown panic because everytime i rationalise them my brain just doesnt believe it and it starts shouting them at me has anyone got any solutions they pop up when i do mindfulness meditation too   could i have ocd without compulsions like a close family member of mine or am i just not rationalising these thoughts well enough    thanks for any help',\n",
       " 'cheers for ur replies  i think ill have a go at it just because i want to try everything i can to help with my anxiety any one got any other suggestions other than cbt im on waitin list for therapist and i have no idea how long that will be',\n",
       " 'hey guys i need to get something off my mind my doctor prescribed me 20mg daily of prozac tp help with my depression at work i knew there could be side effects so i was a lil anxious about it infact tbh i never wanted to go on prozac but i decided to give it a go    to cut a long story short i started it this sunday but i jus kept worryin bout it in my mind so i got to today so thats 3 days on it and ive stopped probs not a gud idea but i dont want to be on antidepressants and i certainly dont want to put up with side effects or withdrawal   im goin to book appointment with doctor soon but im really anxious about wat ive done i keep thinkin that maybe its really gonna cause me problems cus ive jus stopped straight away i feel hot like im burnin up but this could be anxiety tbh wat shuld i do']"
