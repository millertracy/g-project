At first i thought its normal then i realized how dumb my action is i should have go to their table and said goodbye rather than saying it from far away that make me look like a panic person, i keep on thinking about this case i think about how my aunt family think about me after my move and etc.\\\n",

But then I started to think what if I am not in control of my body anymore, and I will jump in the river or I want to go at to start fight some guy on the street and I will finish in jail because I will be aggressive or mby I will finish in mental hospital.. I started to to shake, my heart wanted to explode. And from then, now when I move my heart is beating really fast and I am afraid to get panic attack again. \\\n",

Sometimes I push myself to go a street or two nearby to where Im going so that I experience a new place and can then have that as somewhere Ive been before that I might be able to go again but I find that hard. Staying at home feels way less anxiety provoking. \\\n",

i have so what can anyone expect me to do im trying my best its so hard for others to understand the level of anxiety i have thats not a criticism at all just i had to go on the shop floor even though i wasnt comfortable and just felt i was dying with panic the other lady there was very nice but its pretty hard to understand my desperation had to keep escaping too many people around too close and i didnt want to be asked anything everything around me feels like a dream i just feel wrong so wrong bus back was manic attention was drawn to me for a second when the driver didnt stop long enough for me to get off i went back to my seat and didnt say anything it wasnt my fault he didnt stop obviously but im convinced i did something really really odd when people looked just horrible alone now

anxiety for years and had numerous therapies and treatments for it but no therapy has seemed to ever work i believe this is due to being undiagnosed with borderline personality disorder im waiting for an assessment which im more than 100 sure i have however ever since taking sertraline for the past 34 months i am happy to say that i am really starting to feel the positive effects socially   i am posting in this forum as i think the problem i am facing is more to do with sa and not bpd for years i have felt very odd at random times around family especially christmas im not extremely close to my family but we do get on i just sometimes feel a feeling i find very very difficult explain its almost as if i feel sick and feel like i dont belong at all it feels quite like im out of my own body more recently i have started to get it with friends because of the sertraline i have started taking part in things i never would before i have seen my friends and done things soberly through the day much more than i ever have but when im sober around my friends i just feel really weird its not awkward its just like i feel sick and shouldnt be around them and dont belong there i dont know if its maybe because im so used to not doing things with them that when i do i maybe just cant remember how it feels its weird because the people i am most close withi do not feel it at all like i feel like i belong with my boyfriend and i could be with him all the time but as soon as we have a family meal i just feel weird and sickly and perhaps quite child like like i almost feel like i shouldnt have a boyfriend around my family and when im with my friends i feel like i shouldnt be there with them because its not like me   ive never ever described this feeling to a doctor before because i simply cant explain it but it really is a horrible feeling and i cant shake it off at all it ends up really ruining my time and i just want to go home and be alone even if im having a nice time there also

was hospitalized a few years ag  and thats when they diagnosed me with bpd  but not they never gave me any special therapy they put me on medications which never seemed to help it either made me sick

listened  i feel like no one has ever taken me seriously and everything i do is just a cry for attention when really im really hurting and i cant stop hurting myself maybe it was my fault because i never told anyone what happened to me to when it happened i was scared and kept it bottled up for years until i didnt see a point anymore they got away with it and its my fault they did i dont think i can forgive myself for that   i dont know how to feel good and when i do feel happy it never last long and i always feel guilty and i dont deserve it smoking is the only way i can feel good and i know its not doing me any good really but i cant stop going a day without is the worst i find myself looking for crumbs and going out trying to find a way to get it and its bad i feel like ive made to many

did telling folks who didnt understand made me feel worse unadaptive to this world so many times felt like i really dont care if i just die didnt get to the point of taking my own life but certainly wont mind if something happen and i just died even felt like a relief the idea of just be done with everything i tried talking to my family and friends and no one seemed to get it everyone thinks that i just need to be strong get over it or im just over sensitive and dramatic it suffocates me what suffocates me more is that i feel like am completely alone and no matter what i say no one in my life  would ever understand i tried telling my girlfriend i bet she just thinks am exaggerating and being over sensitive since she didnt really give it much of attention or asked me about any of what i told her i guess she doesnt even wanna listen she simply doesnt believe it  im so sorry for what youre going through i know how hard this can be')])\n",

accused of a heinous crime of which i wont mention i was nfad about 2 weeks ago and was proven innocent since october 2016 ive slowly been becoming less and less social although i wasnt exactly confident growing up i was in foster care from 8 years old until i was 16 ran away early i have always been a shy lad but in the past year its gotten to the point where i dont leave the house anymore i probably go out once every few weeks i have been to my gp and am now taking 50mg sertraline for social anxiety i also smoke cannabis and have been since around december 2016 i know i need to kick this habit and i have tried infact at the time of writing i havent smoked anything so i guess its a start my family has a history of mental issues my sister has anxiety herself and my mother has severe depression and anxiety she leaves the house less than me and i hate it because i want her to enjoy life i think one of the reasons i cant motivate myself to go outside and actually do things is because my mum cant and i feel bad leaving her back here and me going out enjoying myself i am regularly invited to go out by my cousin and my best mate but 90 of the time i make excuses and i hate myself for it i used to go out with my step dad who i love as much as my mum every saturday and sunday and almost every other day of the week just doing odd things helping him with shopping etc but now i dont go with him anymore i think i went out around 3 weeks ago for 1 day said i was going to change myself and here i am again back at the beginning ive researched into how to motivate myself and how to get off my ass and actually do something but nothing works i hate the way my life is going and i just dont know how to fix it people have said to me in the past things like force yourself to go out and youll enjoy it but i dont i hate being around people especially people i dont know its the same reason i dont have a job i severely want one to fund myself and my family as were not exactly on the rich end of the spectrumin 2016 i did have an opportunity to do volunteer work had my step dad drive me there and i couldnt get out the car i was terrified of a volunteer job    i just

changed though  things have got worse very quickly  and im feeling completely and utterly unable to lead a normal life anymore  i hate being around people i cant go into the supermarket as i feel people are staring at me i cant speak to colleagues and sometimes even speaking to my mum is something id rather not do anymore  my job involves speaking to and meeting new people and im about to pack it in as i just cant do it anymore  i absolutely dread social events like parties or going to the pub etc and meeting and speaking to new people on a social level is just impossible these days  my husband plays in a band and going to watch him just fills me with dread as i know there will be lots of people there and ill be on my own  its hard to explain the way i feel  i wake up every morning

for about a week now  my husband is very supportive but bless him i really dont think he knows what to do  i dont know what to do either as i dont understand whats happening to me  i remember being around 6 or 7 years old and being branded as shy and growing up always left me feeling awkward and quiet  i really have no real friends as everyone ive made friends with in the past have just let me down or drifted away  people who i considered as friends have turned out really not to be who i thought they were so i tend to treat people with caution now and find it impossible to trust people and make friends  i spend all my weekends alone husband works and thats actually the way i like it  even when my husband is at home i tend to spend all my time in the bedroom alone reading or on the computer  ive reached a stage now that i really dont know what to do  i have zero social life other than when i go out with my husband its only him and i and i feel fine with that and all i do is work then come home and shut myself away from the world  i hate speaking to people  i hate being in public  i feel so nervous around people i dont know  i dont trust people easily  i feel like im going crazy  i havent enjoyed life for a while as i worry myself sick about everything  i sleep for only around three hours or so per night  i dont know why im like this as ive been told im a really caring

finding things so hard  i miss the company from the job i used to do and the people i knew there  my husband is lovely and i look at him and wish i was as confident as him  he has lots of friends  hes introduced me to them on nights out but i just end up feeling awkward and stupid and boring   i feel like ive got nothing interesting to say and people think im ridiculous  im sorry about this post as i feel like i sound really sorry for myself  ive typed how i feel to see if anyone can determine what the hell is wrong with me  i just want to get on with my life  i want to be able to walk out the door of my house without wanting to run back in the minute i see someone else in the street  i want to feel as though im not going crazy  the only time i feel like a normal human being is when ive had

       "  'im pretty unhappy so im going to write down some stuff that just keeps swirling around in my head so itll probably end up being quite a long post as ive never really ever put anything down on paper sorry to anyone who ends up taking the time to read it but thank you aswell   just a little about me first of all im 18 12 years of age just a tad over 6 foot 4 just under 65 my weight has gone up and down roughly from 250lbs to about 260lbs since i was about 16 12 years old so its relatively constant ie i dont put on huge amounts of weight or lose it   i am overweight but i dont look like someone who is obese or extremely overweight whether this is due to my height and size carrying the weight a bit better im not too sure i am a big guy theres no denying it but its something im extremely self conscious about and tend to shy away from going outside to avoid being noticed wishing i didnt have such a presence and size as a result i tend to look nervous and have a bad posture in the company of other people just wanting the ground to swallow me up i think i have got an anxiety problem as i tend to feel really uncomfortable about going outside but ive never really had a panic attack    i was never a shy person and growing up from about the age of 13 to 1516 i never had any problems making friends talking to people and generally just enjoying my life and not worrying about insecurities in myself and facing judgement from others such as being overweight or anything like this yes i also know that being overweight isnt good but its the fact im not happy with who i am that i need to fix first of all before i can change such things as being overweight   aged 16 having left secondaryhigh school my life has really taken a turn for the worst and for the last 2 or so years since i left ive been constantly depressed hating everything about myself and my appearance and just feeling downright lonely and as though im not good enough to be in anyones life as their friend or even in a relationship    ive spent a lot of time just dwelling on what are seemingly small things such as imperfections in my outside appearance and even thinking that as a result im going to end up being some loner for the rest of my lifethis is something that genuinely scares me and i dont want to happen but with the way i feel now looks so far awaywhen i bare in mind that there are people in much worse situations than myself i tend to say pull yourself together and i do for the rest of the day then i slip back into self loathing and wishing i could just hide away the next day    as a result of how i feel ive spent alot of time at home not socialising very often and doing things with people apart from speaking on msn messenger and emails and in general just sitting around doing nothing but going on the internet    i have spent periods of the last 2 years doing various things ie a couple of full times jobs and also at college but every time ive started fine within weeks or months i just got to the point where i could not physically do it because i felt so low and not wanting to face doing such things anymore ive not felt suicidal but just havent wanted to leave my house or be in contact with anyone but my family    more recently in fact from about september 2009 ive been signed up to a 2 year college course and all was fine up until about february 2010 when i just couldnt carry on any longer i went to see my doctorgp about it and was advised that i needed to have a break out from college due to depression and i was put on one 20mg tablet of fluoxetine a day not too sure if thats the correct spelling i spoke with my tutor and he was fine with me taking a break and returning within 4 weeks i never did but my tutor was happy enough for me to complete work from home and email him the work i needed to do to complete the course    fortunately i havent had a problem getting this work done so the 1st year of my college course has been completed but this is where my dilemma really starts to get difficult as my tutor wants to know if i feel as though i can do the 2nd year at the college now i personally want too as i like the people in my class i find it interesting etc etc but i really dont know how i will react when the time comes to go back into class if i will be able to cope i have told him id like to go back but i am genuinely worried about the next year in my life   im mainly worried as my mum is permanently ill type 1 diabetic and suffers from me and my dad is her full time carer so money is not terribly easy to come by and things are tight my mum gets financial support for me being at college but due to me having a bad time in the last 2 years she is getting worried that she will lose the financial support she currently gets for me being taken off of my course    so i basically have two choices try and get through my course meanwhile with all the issues ive got still going unresolved in my own head making things worse but if i end up not being able to cope i really need to get a job as we cannot afford for me to be at home aswell with no income being generated   i just wish i could solve all of my problems and stop thinking and feeling the way i do as while they dont seem to be huge problems all added together they are literally ruining my life and stopping me from enjoying it    my family are supportive and they are also fully aware about how i feel and do help me as is my doctor and tutor but whilst i have felt better since ive been off sick from college with depression i cant see an end coming to where i will one day just be able to get up and be able to get on with my life in a way i can feel relatively comfortable with myself enough to enjoy and cope with it    my weight is also something that ive become almost obsessed with to the point where i feel desperate and helpless and have even seen myself googling answers for quick weight loss plans i dont eat bad or too much i just literally do not do anything i want to get up and do exercise but i genuinely dont want to leave the house with the way i feel so i end up getting depressed once again   i do realise it requires a lifestyle change to keep weight off but its just got me to the point where im so unhappy and down that i cant see any way i can change it wanting quick fixes is just literally ruining me as i dont ever really feel as though i can go outside   ive never ever thought of committing suicide as i do still want to do lots of things such as get married have a family get a decent job and see and do lots of things its just not something i can look forward too all the time i have such a severely low self esteem and confidence     im just getting really down once again and angry with myself that i cant seem to change how i feel and think and i dont want to feel sorry for myself or anything like that i just wish it would all go away   sorry if this seems really confusing and not in any particular order or even makes sense as i just typed as much as i could think of as to how im feeling   thanks to anyone who takes the time to read through my pitiful attempt at feeling sorry for myself\\n'])"

posting in this forum as i think the problem i am facing is more to do with sa and not bpd for years i have felt very odd at random times around family especially christmas im not extremely close to my family but we do get on i just sometimes feel a feeling i find very very difficult explain its almost as if i feel sick and feel like i dont belong at all it feels quite like im out of my own body more recently i have started to get it with friends because of the sertraline i have started taking part in things i never would before i have seen my friends and done things soberly through the day much more than i ever have but when im sober around my friends i just feel really weird its not awkward its just like i feel sick and shouldnt be around them and dont belong there i dont know if its maybe because im so used to not doing things with them that when i do i maybe just cant remember how it feels its weird because the people i am most close withi do not feel it at all like i feel like i belong with my boyfriend and i could be with him all the time but as soon as we have a family meal i just feel weird and sickly and perhaps quite child like like i almost feel like i shouldnt have a boyfriend around my family and when im with my friends i feel like i shouldnt be there with them because its not like me   ive never ever described this feeling to a doctor before because i simply cant explain it but it really is a horrible feeling and i cant shake it off at all it ends up really ruining my time and i just want to go home and be alone even if im having a nice time there also

was hospitalized a few years ag  and thats when they diagnosed me with bpd  but not they never gave me any special therapy they put me on medications which never seemed to help it either made me sick

listened  i feel like no one has ever taken me seriously and everything i do is just a cry for attention when really im really hurting and i cant stop hurting myself maybe it was my fault because i never told anyone what happened to me to when it happened i was scared and kept it bottled up for years until i didnt see a point anymore they got away with it and its my fault they did i dont think i can forgive myself for that   i dont know how to feel good and when i do feel happy it never last long and i always feel guilty and i dont deserve it smoking is the only way i can feel good and i know its not doing me any good really but i cant stop going a day without is the worst i find myself looking for crumbs and going out trying to find a way to get it and its bad i feel like ive made to many

did telling folks who didnt understand made me feel worse unadaptive to this world so many times felt like i really dont care if i just die didnt get to the point of taking my own life but certainly wont mind if something happen and i just died even felt like a relief the idea of just be done with everything i tried talking to my family and friends and no one seemed to get it everyone thinks that i just need to be strong get over it or im just over sensitive and dramatic it suffocates me what suffocates me more is that i feel like am completely alone and no matter what i say no one in my life  would ever understand i tried telling my girlfriend i bet she just thinks am exaggerating and being over sensitive since she didnt really give it much of attention or asked me about any of what i told

accused of a heinous crime of which i wont mention i was nfad about 2 weeks ago and was proven innocent since october 2016 ive slowly been becoming less and less social although i wasnt exactly confident growing up i was in foster care from 8 years old until i was 16 ran away early i have always been a shy lad but in the past year its gotten to the point where i dont leave the house anymore i probably go out once every few weeks i have been to my gp and am now taking 50mg sertraline for social anxiety i also smoke cannabis and have been since around december 2016 i know i need to kick this habit and i have tried infact at the time of writing i havent smoked anything so i guess its a start my family has a history of mental issues my sister has anxiety herself and my mother has severe depression and anxiety she leaves the house less than me and i hate it because i want her to enjoy life i think one of the reasons i cant motivate myself to go outside and actually do things is because my mum cant and i feel bad leaving her back here and me going out enjoying myself i am regularly invited to go out by my cousin and my best mate but 90 of the time i make excuses and i hate myself for it i used to go out with my step dad who i love as much as my mum every saturday and sunday and almost every other day of the week just doing odd things helping him with shopping etc but now i dont go with him anymore i think i went out around 3 weeks ago for 1 day said i was going to change myself and here i am again back at the beginning ive researched into how to motivate myself and how to get off my ass and actually do something but nothing works i hate the way my life is going and i just dont know how to fix it people have said to me in the past things like force yourself to go out and youll enjoy it but i dont i hate being around people especially people i dont know its the same reason i dont have a job i severely want one to fund myself and my family as were not exactly on the rich end of the spectrumin 2016 i did have an opportunity to do volunteer work had my step dad drive me there and i couldnt get out the car i was terrified of a volunteer job    i just

i guess im hoping someone can help me out please  for years ive been suffering from very low selfesteem and i feel generally awkward in the company of people i dont know  some days even leaving my house can be a huge challenge and when i do i cant wait to get back home  the last few months something has changed though  things have got worse very quickly  and im feeling completely and utterly unable to lead a normal life anymore  i hate being around people i cant go into the supermarket as i feel people are staring at me i cant speak to colleagues and sometimes even speaking to my mum is something id rather not do anymore  my job involves speaking to and meeting new people and im about to pack it in as i just cant do it anymore  i absolutely dread social events like parties or going to the pub etc and meeting and speaking to new people on a social level is just impossible these days  my husband plays in a band and going to watch him just fills me with dread as i know there will be lots of people there and ill be on my own  its hard to explain the way i feel  i wake up every morning thinking and hoping ill feel better and that all these silly feelings will disappear but they dont  in the past ive felt like this for a few days then it goes but this time ive been feeling like this for about a week now  my husband is very supportive but bless him i really dont think he knows what to do  i dont know what to do either as i dont understand whats happening to me  i remember being around 6 or 7 years old and being branded as shy and growing up always left me feeling awkward and quiet  i really have no real friends as everyone ive made friends with in the past have just let me down or drifted away  people who i considered as friends have turned out really not to be who i thought they were so i tend to treat people with caution now and find it impossible to trust people and make friends  i spend all my weekends alone husband works and thats actually the way i like it  even when my husband is at home i tend to spend all my time in the bedroom alone reading or on the computer  ive reached a stage now that i really dont know what to do  i have zero social life other than when i go out with my husband its only him and i and i feel fine with that and all i do is work then come home and shut myself away from the world  i hate speaking to people  i hate being in public  i feel so nervous around people i dont know  i dont trust people easily  i feel like im going crazy  i havent enjoyed life for a while as i worry myself sick about everything  i sleep for only around three hours or so per night  i dont know why im like this as ive been told im a really caring person and id do anything for anyone  i guess i just want to be normal  i was recently made redundant from a job id done for years and with people who id known for years  im self employed now and finding things so hard  i miss the company from the job i used to do and the people i knew there  my husband is lovely and i look at him and wish i was as confident as him  he has lots of friends  hes introduced me to them on nights out but i just end up feeling awkward and stupid and boring   i feel like ive got nothing interesting to say and people think im ridiculous  im sorry about this post as i feel like i sound really sorry for myself  ive typed how i feel to see if anyone can determine what the hell is wrong with me  i just want to get on with my life  i want to be able to walk out the door of my house without wanting to run back in the minute i see someone else in the street  i want to feel as though im not going crazy  the only time i feel like a normal human being is when ive had a few glasses of wine  i know this isnt a good thing as i cant spend the rest of my

job i left school after year 11 and that was 4 years ago ive been struggling to find a job ever since but no one will give me the time of day and i know its because they can see i have low confidence and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (159389, 'im pretty unhappy so im going to write down some stuff that just keeps swirling around in my head so itll probably end up being quite a long post as ive never really ever put anything down on paper sorry to anyone who ends up taking the time to read it but thank you aswell   just a little about me first of all im 18 12 years of age just a tad over 6 foot 4 just under 65 my weight has gone up and down roughly from 250lbs to about 260lbs since i was about 16 12 years old so its relatively constant ie i dont put on huge amounts of weight or lose it   i am overweight but i dont look like someone who is obese or extremely overweight whether this is due to my height and size carrying the weight a bit better im not too sure i am a big guy theres no denying it but its something im extremely self conscious about and tend to shy away from going outside to avoid being noticed wishing i didnt have such a presence and size as a result i tend to look nervous and have a bad posture in the company of other people just wanting the ground to swallow me up i think i have got an anxiety problem as i tend to feel really uncomfortable about going outside but ive never really had a panic attack    i was never a shy person and growing up from about the age of 13 to 1516 i never had any problems making friends talking to people and generally just enjoying my life and not worrying about insecurities in myself and facing judgement from others such as being overweight or anything like this yes i also know that being overweight isnt good but its the fact im not happy with who i am that i need to fix first of all before i can change such things as being overweight   aged 16 having left secondaryhigh school my life has really taken a turn for the worst and for the last 2 or so years since i left ive been constantly depressed hating everything about myself and my appearance and just feeling downright lonely and as though im not good enough to be in anyones life as their friend or even in a relationship    ive spent a lot of time just dwelling on what are seemingly small things such as imperfections in my outside appearance and even thinking that as a result im going to end up being some loner for the rest of my lifethis is something that genuinely scares me and i dont want to happen but with the way i feel now looks so far awaywhen i bare in mind that there are people in much worse situations than myself i tend to say pull yourself together and i do for the rest of the day then i slip back into self loathing and wishing i could just hide away the next day    as a result of how i feel ive spent alot of time at home not socialising very often and doing things with people apart from speaking on msn messenger and emails and in general just sitting around doing nothing but going on the internet    i have spent periods of the last 2 years doing various things ie a couple of full times jobs and also at college but every time ive started fine within weeks or months i just got to the point where i could not physically do it because i felt so low and not wanting to face doing such things anymore ive not felt suicidal but just havent wanted to leave my house or be in contact with anyone but my family    more recently in fact from about september 2009 ive been signed up to a 2 year college course and all was fine up until about february 2010 when i just couldnt carry on any longer i went to see my doctorgp about it and was advised that i needed to have a break out from college due to depression and i was put on one 20mg tablet of fluoxetine a day not too sure if thats the correct spelling i spoke with my tutor and he was fine with me taking a break and returning within 4 weeks i never did but my tutor was happy enough for me to complete work from home and email him the work i needed to do to complete the course    fortunately i havent had a problem getting this work done so the 1st year of my college course has been completed but this is where my dilemma really starts to get difficult as my tutor wants to know if i feel as though i can do the 2nd year at the college now i personally want too as i like the people in my class i find it interesting etc etc but i really dont know how i will react when the time comes to go back into class if i will be able to cope i have told him id like to go back but i am genuinely worried about the next year in my life   im mainly worried as my mum is permanently ill type 1 diabetic and suffers from me and my dad is her full time carer so money is not terribly easy to come by and things are tight my mum gets financial support for me being at college but due to me having a bad time in the last 2 years she is getting worried that she will lose the financial support she currently gets for me being taken off of my course    so i basically have two choices try and get through my course meanwhile with all the issues ive got still going unresolved in my own head making things worse but if i end up not being able to cope i really need to get a job as we cannot afford for me to be at home aswell with no income being generated   i just wish i could solve all of my problems and stop thinking and feeling the way i do as while they dont seem to be huge problems all added together they are literally ruining my life and stopping me from enjoying it    my family are supportive and they are also fully aware about how i feel and do help me as is my doctor and tutor but whilst i have felt better since ive been off sick from college with depression i cant see an end coming to where i will one day just be able to get up and be able to get on with my life in a way i can feel relatively comfortable with myself enough to enjoy and cope with it    my weight is also something that ive become almost obsessed with to the point where i feel desperate and helpless and have even seen myself googling answers for quick weight loss plans i dont eat bad or too much i just literally do not do anything i want to get up and do exercise but i genuinely dont want to leave the house with the way i feel so i end up getting depressed once again   i do realise it requires a lifestyle change to keep weight off but its just got me to the point where im so unhappy and down that i cant see any way i can change it wanting quick fixes is just literally ruining me as i dont ever really feel as though i can go outside   ive never ever thought of committing suicide as i do still want to do lots of things such as get married have a family get a decent job and see and do lots of things its just not something i can look forward too all the time i have such a severely low self esteem and confidence     im just getting really down once again and angry with myself that i cant seem to change how i feel and think and i dont want to feel sorry for myself or anything like that i just wish it would all go away   sorry if this seems really confusing and not in any particular order or even makes sense as i just typed as much as i could think of as to how im feeling   thanks to anyone who takes the time to read through my pitiful attempt at feeling sorry for myself')])\n",

      "((1588361, 'hey guys my name is marky im 20 years old and i think i need some advice its gonna be a long one so sorry about that   im gonna start from the beginning in october 2016 i was accused of a heinous crime of which i wont mention i was nfad about 2 weeks ago and was proven innocent since october 2016 ive slowly been becoming less and less social although i wasnt exactly confident growing up i was in foster care from 8 years old until i was 16 ran away early i have always been a shy lad but in the past year its gotten to the point where i dont leave the house anymore i probably go out once every few weeks i have been to my gp and am now taking 50mg sertraline for social anxiety i also smoke cannabis and have been since around december 2016 i know i need to kick this habit and i have tried infact at the time of writing i havent smoked anything so i guess its a start my family has a history of mental issues my sister has anxiety herself and my mother has severe depression and anxiety she leaves the house less than me and i hate it because i want her to enjoy life i think one of the reasons i cant motivate myself to go outside and actually do things is because my mum cant and i feel bad leaving her back here and me going out enjoying myself i am regularly invited to go out by my cousin and my best mate but 90 of the time i make excuses and i hate myself for it i used to go out with my step dad who i love as much as my mum every saturday and sunday and almost every other day of the week just doing odd things helping him with shopping etc but now i dont go with him anymore i think i went out around 3 weeks ago for 1 day said i was going to change myself and here i am again back at the beginning ive researched into how to motivate myself and how to get off my ass and actually do something but nothing works i hate the way my life is going and i just dont know how to fix it people have said to me in the past things like force yourself to go out and youll enjoy it but i dont i hate being around people especially people i dont know its the same reason i dont have a job i severely want one to fund myself and my family as were not exactly on the rich end of the spectrumin 2016 i did have an opportunity to do volunteer work had my step dad drive me there and i couldnt get out the car i was terrified of a volunteer job    i just dont know what to do ive been on the sertraline for probably 23 months and although ive felt a slight increase in my mood i still havent the motivation to do anything'), [(361046, 'im new to this and i guess im hoping someone can help me out please  for years ive been suffering from very low selfesteem and i feel generally awkward in the company of people i dont know  some days even leaving my house can be a huge challenge and when i do i cant wait to get back home  the last few months something has changed though  things have got worse very quickly  and im feeling completely and utterly unable to lead a normal life anymore  i hate being around people i cant go into the supermarket as i feel people are staring at me i cant speak to colleagues and sometimes even speaking to my mum is something id rather not do anymore  my job involves speaking to and meeting new people and im about to pack it in as i just cant do it anymore  i absolutely dread social events like parties or going to the pub etc and meeting and speaking to new people on a social level is just impossible these days  my husband plays in a band and going to watch him just fills me with dread as i know there will be lots of people there and ill be on my own  its hard to explain the way i feel  i wake up every morning thinking and hoping ill feel better and that all these silly feelings will disappear but they dont  in the past ive felt like this for a few days then it goes but this time ive been feeling like this for about a week now  my husband is very supportive but bless him i really dont think he knows what to do  i dont know what to do either as i dont understand whats happening to me  i remember being around 6 or 7 years old and being branded as shy and growing up always left me feeling awkward and quiet  i really have no real friends as everyone ive made friends with in the past have just let me down or drifted away  people who i considered as friends have turned out really not to be who i thought they were so i tend to treat people with caution now and find it impossible to trust people and make friends  i spend all my weekends alone husband works and thats actually the way i like it  even when my husband is at home i tend to spend all my time in the bedroom alone reading or on the computer  ive reached a stage now that i really dont know what to do  i have zero social life other than when i go out with my husband its only him and i and i feel fine with that and all i do is work then come home and shut myself away from the world  i hate speaking to people  i hate being in public  i feel so nervous around people i dont know  i dont trust people easily  i feel like im going crazy  i havent enjoyed life for a while as i worry myself sick about everything  i sleep for only around three hours or so per night  i dont know why im like this as ive been told im a really caring person and id do anything for anyone  i guess i just want to be normal  i was recently made redundant from a job id done for years and with people who id known for years  im self employed now and finding things so hard  i miss the company from the job i used to do and the people i knew there  my husband is lovely and i look at him and wish i was as confident as him  he has lots of friends  hes introduced me to them on nights out but i just end up feeling awkward and stupid and boring   i feel like ive got nothing interesting to say and people think im ridiculous  im sorry about this post as i feel like i sound really sorry for myself  ive typed how i feel to see if anyone can determine what the hell is wrong with me  i just want to get on with my life  i want to be able to walk out the door of my house without wanting to run back in the minute i see someone else in the street  i want to feel as though im not going crazy  the only time i feel like a normal human being is when ive had a few glasses of wine  i know this isnt a good thing as i cant spend the rest of my life being drunk just to fit in  thanks for reading this'), (1064658, 'hi just joined today   im a 20 year old female and ive had severe social anxiety for as long as i can remember its so bad its gotten to the point where i cant even answer my phone because i dont want to talk to anyone i dont like going to family gatherings i dont like being around people at all ive never been able to get a job i left school after year 11 and that was 4 years ago ive been struggling to find a job ever since but no one will give me the time of day and i know its because they can see i have low confidence and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (1025867, 'i havent told anybody about the self harming because its embarrasing  i havent told anybody about wanting to kill myself because my step brother tried to kill himself so anything other than the act itself is being an attention seeker apparently  also whats the famous saying dont tell anybody your problems because 80 of people dont care and the other 20 are glad you have them  i dont want to tell people about it  im embarrased by it i still want to do it though  all i wanted to know was what was wrong with me to put a name to a condition because im certain i have something with the things im thinking  i hate the way i look i hate the way im perceived i always think people are judging me in a negative way i hate how people are rude  even though id consider myself mild mannered recently ive been thinking of hurting people who i perceive as rude i wanted to get pinnoplasty surgery but i cant afford it i dont like socialising outside of work  football because i feel people are juding me or are going to mock me  put me on the spot i have been into town or socialising maybe 3 times in 8 years as a result ive lost my friends that i had and on top of that i dont date because i dont like going out i use to have ocd querks washing hands symmetry repetitions but i dont anymore i think about suicide alot i hate the idea of growing old and i constantly think to myself this has happened it will never happen again for example going to primary school on my first day etc i also hate growing old because i feel like people think you should be married by 28 have kids by 30 etc when i  speak id say im perceived as energetic and hyper  talkative but by the end of the day or sometimes minutes later i feel low again   i also hate when people say suicide is selfish  selfish is expecting me to hang around even though i hate my life so that other people dont have to feel bad or sad because i killed myself people seem to think that we should be content just being alive i cant wait to hang around and watch the only people in the world i have die of a heart attack old age')])\n",

gotten to the point where i cant even answer my phone because i dont want to talk to anyone i dont like going to family gatherings i dont like being around people at all ive never been able to get a job i left school after year 11 and that was 4 years ago ive been struggling to find a job ever since but no one will give me the time of day and i know its because they can see i have low confidence and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (306265, 'im 22 and i havent left my house for social reasons for about 2 years this is the first time ive spoken about myself in this way and im not sure exactly what im expecting to get out of it but i just felt like i should let something out and see what exactly that is im just going to type as things come to my head so my apologies if its hard work reading or if i come accross as an illiterate moron  although my  social anxiety has gotten me very depressed in the past my worst point was about 6months ago when i began planning suicide which i am past now ive always dealt with it but its getting alot worse and its just got to the point where i just want to sort my life out before its too late at 22 im yet to kiss a girl im not a bad looking guy and im in good health my appearance is definately not the problem the fact that im totally shit scared of social encounters is i guess im lonely i have so much love to give and yearn the same its not only that i have sa to deal with but the knock on effects of 2 years of depression aswell my enthusiasm has been drained out of me over time i have the motivation to do nothing nothing interests me and i find myself hating everything around me ive become such a sad bitter person and i hate it i just want to be happy and let the good person i am shine ive lost contact with all my friends from school which is probably a good thing since their idiots like 90 of people around my age with their moronic boozing lifestyles and pointless fb bullshit the thing is i just dont seem to connect with other people my age that well they all seem so simple maybe i just havent met the right people maybe im not looking in the right places either way its all pointless when i cant step out my house to meet those people anyway the fact is im not enjoying my life and its slowly slipping away from me since deciding suicide definately isnt an option i feel so trapped i dont see anyway of dealing with my problem lately i have been breaking down into tears out of sheer fustration that i cant get what i want out of life purely because i cannot function in social environments if i had the balls to just step out of my house for anything other than work my life would be so much better but i just cant do it im 22 im in good health im not a bad looking guy im smart i have a nice family i havent experienced anything traumatic i have a good job that pays well enough and sometimes i even enjoy i shouldnt be this unhappy nor do i deserve to be this unhappy when theres people in far worse situations than me    like i said im not sure what exactly im expecting to get out of posting this its a new experience for me i guess i just want to see what kind of advice people offer and their reactions to my situation

posting in this forum as i think the problem i am facing is more to do with sa and not bpd for years i have felt very odd at random times around family especially christmas im not extremely close to my family but we do get on i just sometimes feel a feeling i find very very difficult explain its almost as if i feel sick and feel like i dont belong at all it feels quite like im out of my own body

maybe because im so used to not doing things with them that when i do i maybe just cant remember how it feels its weird because the people i am most close withi do not feel it at all like i feel like i belong with my boyfriend and i could be with him all the time but as soon as we have a family meal i just feel weird and sickly and perhaps quite child like like i almost feel like i shouldnt have a boyfriend around my family and when im with my friends i feel like i shouldnt be there with them because its not like me   ive never ever described this feeling to a doctor before because i simply cant explain it but it really is a horrible feeling and i cant shake it off at all it ends up really ruining my time and i just want to go home and be alone even if im having a nice time there also

and low self esteem and they dont want that around their customers i know getting a job would be good for me and give me routine in my life because all ive been doing for the past 4 years is sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes more  my family dont understand at all so i dont even bother trying to tell them how i feel   its my 21st birthday in less than a month and it hurts me that i wont even be having a party or celebrating it i cant have a party because i have no friends and hardly any family ive never had a boyfriend because well lets face it what guy wants a depressed sad girl   i have no motivation to do anything anymore sometimes i think suicide is the best option for me i have nothing to look forward to when i wake up so whats the point its just the same bullshit everyday im over it'), (306265, 'im 22 and i havent left my house for social reasons for about 2 years this is the first time ive spoken about myself in this way and im not sure exactly what im expecting to get out of it but i just felt like i should let something out and see what exactly that is im just going to type as things come to my head so my apologies if its hard work reading or if i come accross as an illiterate moron  although my  social anxiety has gotten me very depressed in the past my worst point was about 6months ago when i began planning suicide which i am past now ive always dealt with it but its getting alot worse and its just got to the point where i just want to sort my life out before its too late at 22 im yet to kiss a girl im not a bad looking guy and im in good health my appearance is definately not the problem the fact that im totally shit scared of social encounters is i guess im lonely i have so much love to give and yearn the same its not only that i have sa to deal with but the knock on effects of 2 years of depression aswell my enthusiasm has been drained out of me over time i have the motivation to do nothing nothing interests me and i find myself hating everything around me ive become such a sad bitter person and i hate it i just want to be happy and let the good person i am shine ive lost contact with all my friends from school which is probably a good thing since their idiots like 90 of people around my age with their moronic boozing lifestyles and pointless fb bullshit the thing is i just dont seem to connect with other people my age that well they all seem so simple maybe i just havent met the right people maybe im not looking in the right places either way its all pointless when i cant step out my house to meet those people anyway the fact is im not enjoying my life and its slowly slipping away from me since deciding suicide definately isnt an option i feel so trapped i dont see anyway of dealing with my problem lately i have been breaking down into tears out of sheer fustration that i cant get what i want out of life purely because i cannot function in social environments if i had the balls to just step out of my house for anything other than work my life would be so much better but i just cant do it im 22 im in good health im not a bad looking guy im smart i have a nice family i havent experienced anything traumatic i have a good job that pays well enough and sometimes i even enjoy i shouldnt be this unhappy nor do i deserve to be this unhappy when theres people in far worse situations than me    like i said im not sure what exactly im expecting to get out of posting this its a new experience for me i guess i just want to see what kind of advice people offer and their reactions to my situation   thanks')])\n",
