I felt a bit clumsy(more so, my anxiety was making me shake so I tried moving around while playing). Alot of people played before I did. Now this is what is worrying me... I bumped into the microphone and my mouth touched it. I am a bit on edge as I keep hearing on the news about the flu and pneumia(spelling?). I was already on antibiotics for 10 days because I went to the doctor and he told me I had bronchitis, I'm worried that could turn into something worse since my mouth touched the mic. When I got back home, I immediatly washed my face and brushed my teeth. This is probably dumb to worry about... anyone else get anxiety over stuff like this?</div> </td> </tr> </table>"
