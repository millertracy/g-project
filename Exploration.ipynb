      "doc: i reckon i get a dose of this social anxiety thing every now and then sometimes im ok but other times i dread of meeting up with anyone in case i get too anxious and have to sort of just get away ive found unless i know someone pretty well i tend to be shy and at the end of the day maybe that is what shyness probably is   on another note upsetting as it is for me im tending to avoid people around where i live as the next door neighbours have been telling lies about me and telling everyone ive got a mental problem apparently they have some device they can listen through walls with great innit i dont wear knickers oh yeah i live next door to a bully ok he thinks hes the dogs bs i call him potato head fiddling the system back garden full of rubbish got another pootato head as a mate and they think they can do what they like vile people real low life i can when im feeling good just blank them out i was quite good at that before i got ill but when im in a low state it really gets to me hi brimble in my part of the country mental health is tied in with learning difficulties challenging behaviour and all things negative so you can draw your own conclusion from that one i cant see how they can do this i mean there are different types of mental illness for starters then different levels of it so i guess someone decided that they couldnt be bothered with pigeon holing everything and decided to put one label for everyone its typical no wonder we get this mixing problem hi again brimble   when i feel good like the past few days i feel i can cope with most of the stuff life has a habit of throwing at you its only on my bad days where i feel lower than a snakes belly do i tend to get this inferiority complex the neighbour issue has been running for quite a few years now but what amuses me how once this jerk and his poisonous girlfriend have spoke to people ive known for years is how they have changed towards me amazing reaction to someone who keeps himself to himself me and never bothers anyone my attitude has become kind of well  em this ones for you ramboghetto about your course apparently i have heard colleges will stop taking students with a disability if they are not guaranteed of getting a job after their course i dont wanna put you off far from it but this is what is gonna be going down in a few years i dont agree with it and it really discriminates thats why up here at the boil on the arsehole of the world aka birmingham private companies are offering independent courses for people with disabilities its all so wrong innit well its the area im working in and believe me the situation is reaching breaking point not only within mental health but other disabled groups as well theyre shutting day centres left right and centre its ridiculous hey i do take a more pessimistic view because im a depressive all you can do is just keep on eye out for her i know what you mean about wearing masks in public i pretend to be happy at work get involved etc but its hard work keeping up the act i get home at times shattered just through putting on the pretence once back at home i can let the mask slip i must be a great actor hi binky i can certainly relate to that my theory ifor myself anyway is that at work i have to pretend to be ok you know appearing to be normal despite feeling very depressed and constantly anxious over the 31 years ive had this illness ive learned to mask it but by the weekend i too am mentally drained more anxious and the depression really takes hold right now just dont want to go out in fact trembling at the thought youre not alone hello and welcome your symptoms sound very much like mine when my anxiety started when i was 25 dont worry about being called a hypochondriac as i believe it is a symptom of anxiety and your doctor should be able to reassure you i dont know if this book is still in print but it really explains anxiety and its effect on the body its called self help for your nerves and its by a dr claire weekes it helped me a great deal through many many dark times good luck young man you will get right well must say i was looking forward to going camping on sunday but alas the anxiety got in the way on saturday morning and i realised i wouldnt be able to make it with a heavy heart and overwhelming sense of defeat i cancelled and lost my deposit so i feel noes as if im off work ill instead of on holiday fed up with it all the never ending loop of anxiety into depression back to anxiety etc sorry guys just feel like a moan yep another bank holiday monday is here and for once it looks like it will be a nice warm sunny day alas here i sit having a nice panic attack no doubt this will be followed by a bout of depression and the loop continues come november and it will be 30 years of this and i once had a doctor tell me at the onset it could last up to 3 years my father died 10 weeks ago and although he was sick it still came as a shock ever since i have this cold feeling inside sort of shivery also the good old panic attacks are returning not to mention an illness phobia are these symptoms of grief has anyone got first hand experience of grief any help would be much appreciated when i first became ill in 1983 i was prescribed diazapam and for me it helped a great deal i got to the stage where i would split the tablet in half or even quarters just to take the edge off i would chew the tablet with a mint to take away the taste i was of the opinion that if you chewed it it would get into your system quicker could do with some now but gp will not prescribe unfortunately sorry to hear of your tragic loss and i have been in your situation when a close uncle passed a long time ago now to be honest with you i never attended the funeral i was simply too ill to go my family new my situation and were very good about it and i know that my uncle would have been too my conscience is clear from then up to now and i know i made the correct decision a trick one to call and at the end of the day whatever you choose to do will be right just a quick reply here speaking from experience have been through what you are going through now had plenty of relationships on the way to meeting the right one and my anxiety was at fault for most of em or so i thought at the end of the day it was the other persons inability to understand my problems on reflection wanting me to be somebody i wasnt eventually i met a kind understanding and loving soul and have now been married for over 11 years good luck hi yesterday i celebrated 27 years of suffering from anxiety and depression yes the beast still lingers refusing to leave i have accepted now this is the way it will be for me and in a way the acceptance is a comfort no more fighting it   yeah i made some progress i eventually got back into work my goal when i became ill but as with goals and the suck like things arent as cracked up as we think they are going to be   am having a bad time a t present my father has been away in hospital for 7 weeks now and the visiting is hell for me i just have such a phobia of the places it has worn me down so much i dont know how long he will be in for but it appears a while longer yet   i am coping just but i am the type of person who does cope in a fashion during a crisis but after the event the reaction and payback kick in usually in the form of a break down i am scared very scared at last the weekend but still this torment goes on in another hour i will be navigating my way through hospital corridors im so tired both mentally and physically i really am scared that when this is all over i will breakdown and everything ive tried hard for will be wasted  i really cant take anymore good morning had some bad news yesterday about my father he has had prostate cancer for quite a while and recently had a bad fall spent a few days in hospital where he had scans after his release to help increase his mobility he was sent to a centre which specializes in doing this yesterday lunchtime i was called out of work by my mother my father had a fall and was taken to ae on getting there the doctor told me about his scans results which showed the cancer had spread to bones and ribs cutting it short last night was spent in the company of several short lived panic attacks an overwhelming anxiety and a deepening depression ive had to share this and write it down i really dont know what else to do have had a bad day again was driving to work this morning and i really felt like i was going to lose control i just wanted to curl up and cry all i can think about is illness death and dying  no happy or even normal thoughts just feel overwhelmed i phoned the place where i used to receive treatment before hoping i could self refer but they dont do that i have to go through the gp who is useless last time i went down to see her in a state she gave me homeopathic stuff even after i told her i get suicidal thoughts im all out of hope you know i swear these people think if we mention the s word were attention seeking or is thinking about it just another symptom as if my depression isnt enough to cope with a times all i needed was the anxiety to come back too had two panic attacks today one when i was driving and the other taking my cairn terrier for a walk im so fed up with it all sorry for going on but i need to tell someone well i tell the gp and its would you like to try a homeopathic remedy actually the panic attacks have abated for the time being but my depression is back with a vengeance i just cant seem to win i wasnt aware of that but ive tried them and they dont do anything for me anxiety rushing through me this morning and i got to go shopping this is gonna be fun i survived the shopping  just had a sleep this afternoon and woke up more agitated than when i nodded off just gotta go with the flow i guess it will go when its ready i hope sounds i got a good excuse for chocolate i tried it some years ago actually theyve got some new stuff out now a cream a spray stuff if you cant sleep and even pastilles expensive though but if it works why not but isnt this the sort of homeopathic route whats eft all about havent been on here in a while which is not good but was feeling okish and i even abandoned the blog i was writing unfortunately nothing lasts forever and in my case this is becoming true again in regards to my anxiety and alas depression   for a few weeks now i have been woken in the night by panic attacks just dont know what that is all about but also have been getting that dreaded underlying feeling of how do i describe it unease dread in my waking hours depression follows this and all in all my confidence has taken a pounding so much so now im beginning to dread leaving the house every morning before i start out for work i get the old stomach churning edginess and if it wasnt for the fact i give someone a lift i think i wouldnt be able to go alone anymore   today i wanted to run out of the supermarket and when taking my dog his afternoon walk the further from home i got the more uncomfortable i felt ok im getting over a cold but although it makes me feel down surely thats not the reason i am so scared it will come back and destroy everything i have worked so hard for i dont honestly think i could pick myself up again if i break down another time my gp is pretty useless as well she just wants to fob me off with homeopathic stuff and get me off anti depressants the only alternative really is to go to hospital sort of voluntary i guess i have been getting lots of these downers and i am wondering if i am bi polar i suppose a re diagnosis wouldnt hurt but at the end of the day im not getting better i am in a quandry just taking each day as it comes trying to go with the flow hi sorry to hear of your situation ive suffered on and off for 27 years now anxiety and depression in my experience it comes and goes right now not having the best of times myself some people overcome completely so dont give up hope right now make the best of your good days and on bad days remember you will come out of it good luck i am of the belief that agoraphobia is not the fear of open spaces as it is made out to be but the actual fear of fear itself for example i spent a couple of years in the house because i was scared not of open spaces but having a panic attack when i was out its open to debate hi just read about your plight hope youre feeling much better now mate every tablet has a side effects leaflet and having a case of the captain trips is probably on everyone of them its just the pharmaceutical companys covering themselves it doesnt mean you are definately going to get what side effects are on the box on a side note some years ago just to explain how the mind can work there i was sitting on the loo reading the medical page in the paper and it was all about what could go wrong with the digestive system i spent around two years mithering and worrying what my poo looked like true over it now thankfully but as they say st happens does anyone know what happened to an old mn group called anxiety and panic attacks self help support group as i would love to get back in touch thanks am afraid to say i feel my whole world is going to come crashing down at anytime soon anyone who has read any of my posts will know that i fought for years to recover from anxiety and depression and return to paid employment which i did but felt pretty well disillusioned by it all   well my workplace has moved so i now have to travel a 20 mile round trip every day and i hate it i want to leave but have got used to the money and getting back on benefit seems impossible i just get home tired and edgy go out every day feeling sick and edgy it seems its a question if when not if i relapse i even found myself listening to a relaxation tape the other evening how scary is that strangely enough islander i actually work within mental health as a classroom assistantsupport worker am still slugging it out hoping i can overcome my problem with the travelling perhaps the more i do it the easier it will get thanks everyone thank you for your kind words ive gone through that phase and you have my sympathy unfortunately it is one of the symptoms of anxiety i was like it for years and years and eventually it just went away looking back i did some weird and wonderful things like buying lots of blue blocks for the toilet so they would colour the water so i dint have to see what id done nough said huh dull weather always has an effect on me i feel really down and depressed i have noticed my dog too hes a cairn terrier and if the sun isnt out he gets morose too probably caught it off me poor soul do any of you get that kind of agitated feeling that never goes away i have a problem with therapists mainly because many have never suffered the way we have how do they really know what we go through how can they understand what it really means to be trembling inside for no apparent reason   i have an appointment with a counsellor tomorrow afternoon and last time i saw her she gave me a prescription for a book from the library seriously its true about improving self esteem well first up i cannot settle to read a book at the moment would have been nice for her to ask about that and secondly i need help with depression and anxiety i have to ask myself at time where these people are at but one things for sure its great work if you can get it i mean who questions them were all supposed to be a wibbly wobbly world of our own most of them regard us as idiots anyway i have experience of this so i know where im coming from   as for beta blockers michael i had then very very early on in my illness and all they did for me was give me a nasty cough and wheezy chest its ok daffy i didnt think it was the magic pill in fact there aint one is there im fast getting to the conclusion this is our cross to bear and we just gotta grin and bear it well were full to the brim with the dogooders up here theres no escaping the blighters risk assessments coming out there asses the works ive come to the conclusion beer is the only answer cant stop thinking about death and cancer every time i switch on tv or open a paper its cancer this cancer that and i have now developed a phobia of the bloody thing add this to my phobia of doctors and death and im living in torment even a lovely day like today cant shake it i feel preoccupied with it all the time  my dad died last year and it has gotten worse since then i dont know if its part of the grief process or what i sometimes wider if this fear of death is a symptom of anxiety or some other form of mental health issue i have a dreadful fear of dying and or illness which has got steadily worse since my father died last year ive had it off and on from teenage years but lately all i ever hear about is death and illness and to be honest i get into an inner turmoil and the thoughts i get like wondering what i will die from etc just overwhelm me and then obviously send me into a depressed state hopefully everyones fears will go im hoping mine do as its not a nice place to be i know someone who has a phobia of used tea bags  seriously as for me a bit of claustrophobia had agoraphobia and a toilet phobia but i aint enlarging on that phobias are real for many people and although some find it amusing it isnt when youre going through it anyone had hypochondria during their illness would be interested to find out colds are like a major disease to me sometimes just a thought does anyone have a sort of person phobia where a certain person has a sort of effect on you for example i was engaged to a girl when i first got sick and developed this type of phobia about her mother when ever i was in her company i used to get all panicky it still happens now ever since that time i can be in certain peoples company and they sort of trigger it off i know im a weirdo but just wondering if im alone on this subject im starting to get like that with my wife if im truthful its not the dentist im scared of its the fear of being in an enclosed space with someone invading my space as it now so happens its that expensive i cant afford to go hi i met and married despite anxiety and depression this was before the days of online dating too at the time it was through the personal columns of the local newspapers it took a while to find the right one but was worth it and weve been married 13 years i discovered there are a lot of people out there with problems and i dont mean with mental health issues either believe me i could write a book on my experiences   inevitably you get knock backs because of your illness but dont let that bother you too much ok a bit hard to take at first but trust me there is someone out there who understands your situation what you go through and is right for you good luck hi sorry to hear of your experience believe me i had this around the same age as you all the tests etc nobody could convince me that there was nothing wrong 31 years later im still hear writing this what you are experiencing is anxiety or panic attacks brought on by your fear of having a heart attack it will pass but as purple chaos mentioned cbt is very good for overcoming that deal with it now and hopefully in 31 years time you wont end up like me still suffering with things like this good luck hi just a quick question before you joined this excellent group did you belong to any others especially in the old man groups would be really interested to know thanks having a real mare of late i keep thinking im going to die imminently and when i dont think that i keep thinking im going to contract a serious terminal illness basically i get panic stricken with the slightest little twinge or imagine i have symptoms that i may come across on the news or tv whatever it really is a living hell and i am close to breaking point    i was at my sister in laws last night and couldnt take my eyes off her husbands mothers photo she passed away with cancer last year and in my mind that was all i could think of definitely not right hi have taken a battering this year my father died in february and along with that comes the usual pressure of work etc today i think everything sort of caught up with me was booked to go camping but just couldnt go have suffered with anxietydepression for many years and despite making some sort of recovery via cbt and finding a job it still bubbles below the surface but today iswas a different story i felt all those years of hard work getting some semblance of meaning back into my life has gone confidence is shot and feel so so useless i am so scared it comes back i just couldnt facetake anymore thanks for the advice i know deep down you are right in what you say but right now things seem so unreal does anyone else have manifestations of this phobia along with their anxiety i seem to get bouts of it when my anxiety levels increase above their norm find it very distressing just a quickie here am really anxious right now and its gonna be a long weekend anyone who knows of me on here will know how i have battled through anxiety and depression to get myself back into the workplace ok im not too happy as getting back to work was not the holy grail i thought it would be but today just before leaving was told that im going to have my days cut to 3 a week instead of 5 which means less money and it really has knocked the stuffing out of me to be honest i just need to write it down sorry\n",

doing ok and hugs for those who are struggling spent most of the day with a migraine and upset stomach seems to have settled down now couldnt take my meds this morning so im just coasting until bedtime woke up earlier with a sense of anxiety went back to sleep woke up again and i had an impending sense of doom and dread went back to sleep woke up again and im having a flat out panic attack i dislike anxiety intensely hope everybody is ok and hugs to those that are struggling woke up early this morning with quite a bit of anxiety wonder if i knew my client was going to call me and leave another vague message now im just going to be anxious all day wondering what he wanted i got triggered in another forum so im going to take a few days away from pc i hope everyone is ok and offer hugs to those that are struggling my therapist gave me his cell and offered me to call him today just to talk because i am struggling with my dog bone cancer diagnosis and well i hate calling people i get such anxiety about it and always worry i am bothering people so i was unsure about it and debated it for hours but i finally did it and called we talked around 10 minutes it went well small steps dowdythefifth i have social anxiety and used to struggle to initiate conversations or even continue conversations others started with me as most of you can relate i wanted to be more normal so i started focusing on my problem areas one of the issues i had was struggling to make eye contact  i forced myself to start making eye contact with strangers and retail workers when i was out and about at first it was difficult and i shied away from it but over time i got better now i have a problem eye contact doesnt bother me anymore but that means i end up making too much eye contact  i dont deliberately stare people down or anything but i have noticed during interviews the interviewer seems to always get uncomfortable towards the end of the interview its much worse with women than with men women tend to get creepy vibes from my focused looks the problem boils down to i dont know how to fix myself so that i dont stare or come off as weird for looking into peoples eyes too much i never aimed to make people uncomfortable but that is exactly what ive done does anyone have any suggestions for making proper eye contact that doesnt come off as creepy or forced moteofsoul if youre talking to someone i find it easier to look away if i nod at something they say or i make a certain to gesture to something i found this link to the secrets to making nonawkward eye contact which helped somewhat i took yalls advice and also softened my gaze i would go into my head when the interviewer was talking instead of focusing on the fact that i was staring someone in the eyes and that seemed to help had another headache today but not as bad as yesterday keeping food and meds down so that is good my second class this term started yesterday its a lot more work than the poetry class but its mandatory got through most of the first module this morning until anxiety kicked in around noon had lunch and laid down for a while need to write a poem this week as well will be making dinner soon seeing my regular doc tomorrow my blood sugar was up because we went shopping hungry and bought a bunch of chocolate stuff so ill have to deal with that getting anxious tomorrow is the first therapy session i will have where i am not bringing one of my dogs it is gonna be too hot for a dog to go out and somehow that feeling of extra vulnerable without him there scares the  outta me i almost feel like i need to cancel not sure i can do a session like this i trust my therapist and feel safe with him but just not used to not having a dog around me its how in general i am able to talk to people easier doing okay i will see my counselor in the morning my doc prescribed a medicine that was once used for other things but now is used to treat anxiety and its non habit forming which was something i liked i started on it tonight and already i see a huge difference wow have i been carrying that emotional weight on my shoulders this whole time it feels like you only know how heavy something is when it is lifted for awhile i awoke disappointed that i did then the dread  and worry  and anxiety jennifer 1967 doing well just got my midterm for my poetry class 700 word essay due on sunday i have the outline written out now to fill it all out along with my other homework arrrgh otherwise im doing alright went to t this morning and that was okay still having restlessness but i

trying to think up a poem for my poetry class been hurting all day knee stopped hurting may be bursitis according to my doc but upper back and shoulders have been kicking finishing up on dinner smells good had some anxiety today but i plowed through it hi everyone before i get started i want to tell you a bit about my past i was diagnosed with social anxiety 10 years ago and would say the time when i was 1415 years old was the time where my anxiety was the absolute worst i couldnt go to school anymore because i was afraid to talk in class felt like people where staring and laughing going to the supermarket was nearly impossible life was a nightmare things slowly started to get better when i turned 18 and i even started a small job at a factory who hires people with mental disorders almost 2 years ago but in the past 68 months things have been going downhill again my best friend ditched me without warning coworkers who used to talk to me stopped doing so some of them now happily greet my husband but ignore me completely while im right there he cant explain why either which is driving me crazy there are also two coworkers who stare at me all the time i hate it i always feel like people are staring at me and giving me judgemental looks i know im far from pretty and look a bit weird but i also feel like i might be behaving weird i just want to be invisible something is wrong with me and i feel like everyone knows it everyone sees it and they all hate and judge me for it and thats why ive often been a victim to bullies teachers even strangers there is a mother with 3 kids 46 years i think who takes the same bus as i do to get to work and even her two sons have pointed and laughed at me before they dont speak german or english so i once again dont even know what was so wrong and funny about me its always like this did i act weird said something stupid made a mistake going out is getting more and more difficult i already cancelled going to the movies with my friend twice and started hating my job my workplace will be somewhere else soon so we will share the building with other workgroups now and i will have to use a different train to get to work which is already stressing me out there was a man on the train today who was staring nonstop for like 3 stops i looked back at him because for a moment i got so angry but when he didnt stop i quickly looked away again because i was afraid he would start yelling or something my husband has anxiety related anger issues which can be problematic when we go out hell start complaining about other people on the bus get angry if someone just looks at him in a weird way or even bump into others if he feels like they are blocking the way i cant talk to him about this hes suffering from his own demons and he would feel betrayed its the last thing i want i feel ugly weak dumb like a coward or a failure and everyone seems to know it i want to be invisible i want to stay at home and not see anyone beside my family and husband anymore even posting this here on a public forum is stressing me out but i dont know what to do sorry this text got so long hi thanisson you are beautiful strong smart brave and successful people that look at you are more likely thinking about themselves and dont know you or have any idea of the person inside of you try to imagine their stares are passing right through you and falling like dust on the floor i hope things get better for you hi thanisson just wanted to say i absolutely relate to your experiences and i wish i could just be invisible as well i have pretty bad social anxiety meds have taken away some of the intensity which has reduced the frequency of panic attacks but the overall thought patterns are still present its difficult when im around people i go for walks every day as a test and as a kind of exposure therapy i constantly practise letting go and try to bring myself to an inner place of centeredness i try not to let the anxious paranoid thoughts take hold which is obviously easier said than done but it helps to a degree and lately ive been trying to be a bit friendlier saying hello sometimes if i catch someone looking at me etc thats helping me as well a little bit keep pluggin away and hang in there thanisson i believe its all about growth i feel the same when im out as if everybody is laughing at me you are not a coward or a failure in fact you are brave and strong for facing this amandabroken chronic anxiety is a state more undesirable than any other and we will try almost any maneuver to eliminate it modern man is living in anxious anticipation of destruction such anxiety can be easily eliminated by selfdestruction as a german saying puts it better an end with terror than a terror without end  robert e neale the art of dying fharraige a little unnerved went to neurosurgeon this afternoon my back looks fine in that sense so i have another referral for pain management insurance wont cover acupuncture so cant do that also made another appointment with dermatology my forehead is still flaking and there is a rash other than that just reading and cleaning up the kitchen making pot roast and it smells good i went on a jet ski tour with my daughter and niece where you encounter and swim with dolphins in the wild and then walk around an island picking up sand dollars i had a big panic attack before we went that i hid from the girls the water was really rough at 515 and i was anxious most of the time i did enjoy swimming with the dolphins finally it was over they want to go again tomorrow hope everyone is doing ok and giving out hugs to those that are struggling this has been a strange day i read and slept through most of it anxiety hit around 1130 am so i laid down and didnt get up until 3 pm i checked the elearning sites for my classes and didnt find anything new kind of sad but i hope it doesnt turn into depression just wishing i couldve done more today but i just wasnt feeling good still have to take a shower and make dinner really tired now though if i were better looking i would have less anxiety i used to be pretty but aging has wreaked havoc on my body i was always vain about my looks and now i know i have nothing left to be vain about i have more anxiety due to knowing how bad i look going home tomorrow after two weeks in florida no anxiety yet thats a good sign had a really good time i want to go home hope everyone is doing ok and giving hugs to all that are struggling tomorrow i have someone coming to hopefully fix a problem with my tv little anxious about this i dont do well at all with people in my personal space and to be quite honest i keep having this thought hell take my tv i know he wont i think all he needs to do is enter some code thing but hmm hopefully i am not going to freak out in front of a professional jennifer 1967 well i dont know if i have social anxiety perhaps i do i take our dog out for long walks in the neighborhood every day but ive always hated crowds years ago when i would be out in public for example at a shopping mall id become increasingly uncomfortable sometimes to the point where i would begin to feel dizzy  disoriented if i remained in the situation long enough i always just kept what was going on with me to myself  toughed it out and id have to say this has gotten better as ive gotten older however i still avoid any kind of crowd like the plague and i prettymuch just keep to myself in general i seldom go anywhere unless its necessary ive also always been extremely glossophobic thankfully i no longer have occasion to do any public speaking but in general id have to say that at this point in my life i dont not go out due to anxiety i just really have no use for people in general in real life  i prefer to keep my own company aloneinky sometimes psychotic sometimes psychotic sometimes psychotic i got diagnosed with social anxiety at 17 and i kinda came about when i came out of high school and was having anxiety attacks that were debiltating that made not want to go to english class upgrading after i graduated from high school it brought up all these nightmares i had that because i was bullied from grade 4 to grade 12 by teachers and students alike my mom always forced me into things and i am introvert through and through to be honest it was like a nightmare i always wanted to go home with her but after awhile after i got used to it but i felt like i was put into a difficult spot it was uncomfortable i remember at 18 being kicked out of my own house she said that i needed to get a job and be a productive part of society yet how could i  i was trapped in my own social anxiety scared stiff so i found a job in alberta and off onto a plane i went with her to fort mcmurray i was scared stiff then the job fell through so i then called someone in jasper after i was working for a short while i doubled over and couldnt work due to debilating period cramps i was taken back to staff accomadation i had some food and took mefanic acid which i had been taking since i was 12but 11 was when i firstly got my period anywaythey fired me on the spot after they asked what i was taking and i showed them the bottle being naive and just really honest i been honest since day one a cab driver convinced me to stayi got a job as a dishwasher and stayed 2 12 years lateryet my mom became very manipulative towards me she demanded that i pay divit ends towards her for all the money that i owed her for feeding me and clothing me through all my years from 017 i was shocked how could this person i know and love turn against me of course my social anxiety went through the roof i started to have panic attacks at work and would lock myself into stalls and not come out unless the radio that i wore went off my work suffered yet they wouldnt fire me i their only housewoman i did double shifts some nightsdays i didnt know what was night and what was day anymore during the winter monthsmy mother wanted me to come home for christmases but thats the most busiest time of the year and how would i leave some place i called home for her home a woman who wanted me to bring her expensive gifts when i stopped at her house or saw her there it was disasterous because i used alcohol at the age of 13 when my dad introduced me to it so i brought her home some truffles in a jar that were white in wine they were expensive and the first thing out of her mouth was how dare you bring me home crap in a bottle i looked at her and thought how could i believe this woman to be my mother i locked myself in the bathroom at my parents house and wouldnt come out i cried and cried attack after attack happened i went on a national youth volunteer program here called katimavik for 9 months  21 i pushed myself to do it my mother would call me everyday asking me what i got up to finally she was interested in what i was doing my anxiety flared up every time she called it didnt help we were 11 strangers living in house together and she wanted to know what i was upt to and when i said nothing she was like where is my cuti told her to never to call me again unless it was urgent then the next day she would call mei just stopped answering the phone she didnt understand long distance was expensive on cellphone especially since i was roaming out of alberta with an alberta area code i made up paper bills and asked her for money to cover the costs of the calls eventually she stopped calling anyways long story short i was comfortable with my group but each place we landed which was a different province every 3 months i had anixety and would make myself puke before an interview because it was so bad to this day i puke every time i go for an interview its like horrible i struggle to get out of the house i also have a huge issues around people and food because they make us food thats like cross contamination i get anxiety going to restuarants but i always ask some times if i never been there before if i could get a chefs sample plate because the anxiety is so bad to order something they dont have that i know someone cannot fck up i also cant read peoples body lanugage too well so its disturbing to me that someone can go from being mad to completely nutso towards someone anyways sorry i droned on i hoped this helped with some peoples fears 1 of the issues i have is that if theirs a lot of people say in a room that actually far away from where i am it sounds like they are actually just outside and i cant even step outside my room to do something even though i know deep down that the next 34 rooms are clear i dont want to be spotted so i used to hate it when my parents had people round to dinner i couldnt go to toilet i couldnt get a drink i couldnt open a window i couldnt do anything my story is simple i avoid mingling with people whenever possible when i cannot i make fool of myself because i would be obviously anxious and nervous which is painful and shatters my selfesteem big time anxiety is a fundamental part of my flawed character since my childhood what works for me ive figured is to be left alone nothing else thats why i am alone most of the time and probably i will die alone which is ok by me i have come to accept this sometimes psychotic shattered sanity i am so anxious today because i think i need to talk to my boyfriend about moving out ive had this apartment for almost 2 years and he moved in shortly after i did everything was good for a while but now were having financial problems and can barely afford to stay here especially with rent going up again next month im at a point where i feel like i have to decide between things that i shouldnt have to decide between like buying a quick snack or going hungry all day or getting my medication or restocking the kitchen i think we need to move back home separately because thats the only way we can save any money hes not going to like it i dont even like it but i cant keep going like this anymore jennifer 1967 psychnitrous fharraige anxiety is a lot better this afternoon my boyfriend took the plan to move our really well thankfully i was a little worried hed want to go with the lets wait and see plan again going to my parents house later to talk to them about moving back in im sure they wont say no just have to start figuring out the time line of moving and what were doing with everything im starting to ease myself into the day woke up late again but oh well new day new start my apartment is clean bonus i have food in the fridge to eat bonus my craft projects are lined up to complete bonus i just feel like lazing about right now its sundaythe weekend except tomorrow i want to get my day started earlier pretend its a real workday since im on a leave of absence from my job for the next few months i would like to keep some sort of schedule going despite being sick my anxiety today was not as bad as yesterday which was really quite bad and scaring mebut i was stuck at home today with sick child so maybe knowing i would be home all day settled it down not sure sometimes psychotic anonymous37955 sometimes psychotic ive never been diagnosed with social anxiety but im sure i have it i can relate to a lot of the experiences in this thread im an introvert who has never really been able to form a lot of friendships even on pc in school i was severely bullied it was during this time i became very aware that i was different to minimize the teasing i withdrew and kept to myself this seemed to have caused me to become awkward and anxious during any social interaction outside of my family i would panic when i had nothing to add to a conversation usually i just ended up being the quiet one no one wanted to befriend me because of that they all claimed i was boring my reserved nature seems to bother people especially the extroverted variety i often relive social situations and criticize myself for things i have said and done sometimes i cant sleep it has gotten to the point where i dont volunteer any information and keep all social interaction to a minimum now i mostly keep to myself i like being alone a lot it is comforting this is eroding my selfesteem even though i enjoy being alone i want a few close friends that i can share life with i even worry about my posts nobody seems to reply to them so i dont post what is really bothering me except for now sometimes psychotic sometimes psychotic sometimes psychotic anxiety is high today i am starting to feel attached to my therapist and terrified beyond words to tell him i cant do it i just cant risk him terminating me or cutting me off from emails etc i need him to stay as is so i dont regret trusting him hoping this will go away soon maybe i should go run some laps or something to clear my mind a bit jennifer 1967 so we got back from florida yesterday after an 8 hour drive i had a panic attack during the trip while i was driving and had to have everyone distract me we got back and there was word waiting on us that my daughter received 4 scholarships that will cover everything down to her books and room and board the college is 2 hours away and i have mixed feelings about that had bad dreams about it last night and awoke with a pounding heart i know i have to let her fly telling myself that doesnt help my anxiety level though it helps to post it here hope everyone is doing ok and hugs to those that are struggling i went to my hair salon this morning i wanted a new look to lift my spirits i think getting your hair cut and dyed can be very stressful for some people it was for me anyway three hours later and the whole time i was clenching my fists my hair has gone from long midback to shoulder length with ombre color surprisinglyi love it i almost cried tears of joy i really needed this change my natural light brown hair doesnt look so ratty anymore thanks for reminding mei needed to set up a hair appt next month been another slow day been in pain and sore and sweating so other than four loads of laundry i didnt do much will make dinner here shortly anxiety came in around 11 am so laid down for a while thelittledidgee ive had social anxiety for as long as i can remember when i was a child i couldnt speak at all in school i was very chatty with my parents but i was completely mute at school my teachers didnt even realize i could talk at first my therapist now says i would have been diagnosed with selective mutism if i saw a psychiatrist at that time starting around age 5 i would have panic attacks at school that were so severe i would pass out throughout my childhood i saw so many doctors and cardiologyneurology specialists trying to determine the source of my episodes now known to be panic attacks so my social anxiety was compounded by hypochondria and the constant fear that my heart was going to explode i also felt like a weird sick kid with all my doctors appointments and would get so embarrassed when i was dizzy or passed out in front of the other kids i would be afraid of having an episode which would make an episode more likely to happen im sure people with panic attacks are familiar with this feedback loop i continued to not have treatment for my social anxiety and was so afraid of speaking i had very few friends and always received poor class participation marks school was always a major social anxiety trigger as i hated being around so many other people my mom thought she was helping my shyness by forcing me into so many extracurricular activities soccer tennis theater piano church groups community service clubs when i was older working at jobs that had high social interaction requirements and i remember my childhood just a big ball of anxiety i picked up some maladaptive coping behaviors to deal with the anxiety i was a huge daydreamer  while the other kids talked to eachother i would sit alone and escape into fantasy worlds in my brain i also started self injurying around 7 years old when i was in my late teens i developed an eating disorder as ive gotten older i am now well into adulthood im more in charge of my lifestyle and dont have to force myself into social situations i dont have many friends and i long for more social contact but its difficult i tend to cycle through phases so some times i am better than other times the idea of going to a social gathering makes me feel sick when i get very overwhelmed sometimes i literally get sick and have to throw up i think being an adult i feel more functional because im less anxious more of the time  but really ive just managed my schedule in a way that im incredibly avoidant of any kind of social trigger im a graduate student now and mostly work independently on my research which is nice my major triggers now are when i have to give presentations at meetings or for my committee feeshee i have this issue as welli tryed the breathing techniquesbut it isnt working very well for me anxiety has taken over my life i am 38 and have zero friends no spouse no children nothing not exactly where i saw my self being this anxiety stems from many many many years of abuse from father to boyfriend verbal emotional and physical i dont like anything about myself and i feel that others dont as well i even tend to only see family when i have to i dont like talking on phone i would rather text it seems like i can get out what i want to say better by writing than by talking my mind moves way faster than my mouth but i can type fast and seem to keep up the strange part of my life is this i work as a pit boss in a casino and i have to be around and talk to people for 8 hours or more and i have no problem whats so ever i enjoy my job very much and i think its because these people dont know me they dont know what ive been through they dont know how i feel about myself when i look in a mirror its like i am a completely different person at work i am confident and outgoing i smile and laugh unless it is slow when it gets slow my thoughts creep back in and i get really quiet i am at a point where i think i need to talk to someone but i dont know where to start i currently have a psychiatrist who only fills me with meds they even diagnosed me with bipolar i or bipolar depression but i dont feel that is whats going on am i depressed yes 100 my life sucks i have also had a very rough life that i dont know how to let go of and move on i have had no guidance just me winging it that is not obviously working from the time i was little i was bullied at school i have a very abusive father and followed suit in boyfriends i feel i dont know how to be happy or what it is supposed to feel like i have so much built up anger and maybe i need some anger management on top of therapy so if you are a person that knows me personally i probably will not attend anything i am invited to unless it is a life changing event i really dont want to be that person any more i want my life back please help i have social anxiety because of the trauma ive suffered at others hands severe bullying severe physical abuse and emotional abuse im very shy a loner and an introvert i too hate crowds and am ill at ease around folks other then my family and close friends im just not willing to open up and get hurt again i am in therapy so maybe someday sometimes psychotic feeshee a lot of anxiety today dont know why medication is not working have so much to do and no motivation to do it much anxiety at being so far behind hope everyone is doing ok and hugs to those that are struggling well yea its anxiety and i just have it its like fear of stuff or just feeling annoyed idk being in college in computer science where people are just so loud annoys me dont know if related my social anxiety can get so bad that i put off work activities and jeopardize my job because of it ive just recently admitted to myself that i suffer from social anxietywell actually i had admitted it to myself i just didnt want to mention it to anyone else the crazy thing is that i actually like being around people i draw energy from being around other people i just suffer such anxiety from having to interact and being afraid of rejection and criticism and judgment that i will avoid social situations at all costs i have recently admitted to myself that my maladaptive avoidance coping behaviors have been causing a lot of harm to my life im trying to work on changing them so i can finally start having the life i want seesaw i have social anxiety mainly because i always feel embarrassed when im out in public this is because my parents are very overprotective of me so they make me wear a lot of heavy winter clothing im always the most bundled up person so it makes me stand out so much especially at school so i just get nervous and start sweating then i swear even more because i get hot wearing so many layers my anxiety got kicked into higher gear today because i had a visitor from the assisted living place she said its no vaping because its a fire hazard what it doesnt burn anything it vaporizes ejuice so ok not for me but the conservator will not like that  me saying i wont go there she will find someplace even worse to force me to go to im really getting high anxiety just thinking about ither no anxiety has shown up today at this time more down then anything else the weather has been dreary since i got back and its really influencing my moods im really down hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling i spent most of the day writing my midterm essay and almost of my homework for the week i still have a little bit left but part of one is waiting for my teammates to post im beat ill look over my essay tomorrow before i turn that in took a shower put dishes away and made a quick dinner my husband is also doing a lot of homework and hes as tired as i am i didnt take the latuda so i didnt have a big anxiety attack today otherwise i did okay if the going down to 20mg doesnt work my new pdoc will try something else i hope not because this will be the fourth time trying a new mood stabilizer and except for the akathisia it works great i live with a narcissistic histrionic manipulative person and im proud of myself for getting along with them 99 of the time today was not one of those times i totally blew up and said some things i probably should not have said im still very very angry and trying to calm down it helps me to get it out thanks for letting me vent im going to orientation with m in midjuly for 2 days the parents  students sleep in the dorms every interaction weve had with this school has been top notch im less anxious and more excited about this now shell get a quality education with no student loan debt i feel like weve been blessed today is sunny so i get to float in the pool i also feel like cleaning the house a little good day so far hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling did a lot of reading today laid down for a couple of hours but still no sleep i slept off and on most of the night its been raining buckets and now the plaster in the living room is peeling no word from the roofers yet last thing we heard was midjuly anxious about the midterm essay and some other assignments i completed i still worry about the quality of work but i think i did what the instructors wanted i just hope its good enough to keep my grades up i read the assigned chapter on meter and rhythm this is the most confusing part for me so i hope i can work something out husband will be cooking steak so i just need to come up with a side dish i have not napped here since ive been here and i usually sleep much more than 8 hoursa night somehow im risking all the edges of my deep fears getting up so late can backfire terribly i should not go back to sleep after im woken meditation and yoga have done wonders for me ive struggled with panic attacks my whole life hugs i have schizoaffective disorder and am 46 yrs old i have so much going on in my head and heart but not able to put anything into words i am talking less and less to my girlfriend my parents and friends its as if all the stuff id like to talk about but cant is accumulating in my brain but i dont know where to start or how to start talking about it i have schizoaffective disorder and im a 46 year old male i havent been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder actually ive never received a diagnosis of any kind i once was given the mmpi to complete one of the findings i recall was that i exhibited schizoid ideation whatever that means no one ever told me i dont talk about anything either im prettymuch reclusive and i dont watch the news on tv or read newspapers so i dont have much of anything to talk about im mostly cut off from the outside world and i dont talk about anything related to my mental health struggles its all so complicated  some of it would be downright humiliating to talk about so i just keep it all to myself but sometimes it begins to feel like the buildup of steam in a pressure cooker oh  im pushing 70 hartbroken i enjoyed adult selective mutism for a little over one year that is i did not speak for one year i didnt even know that there was a selective mutism section here its so rare among adults what you describe doesnt really sound like selective mutism at least not as i experienced it in my situation i could have spoken i didnt lack the ability or words to express myself i just chose not to from what youve written it appears that youre having trouble expressing yourself to others i dont know what could cause that do you see a therapist or psychiatrist went to a park after breakfast and took pictures it was nice outside and not too hot there were a lot of photographers out so it was fun talking about what they like in photos and what not came home and anxiety kicked in so i laid down thinking itll be an hour or two woke up at 3 pm still had to finish my team homework assignment but i got it done now debating what to make for dinner my husband is now taking a nap and i dont know when hell wake up what we originally planned for dinner needed to start this morning i also still need to take a shower but i may do that after dinner im kind of nervous but ill probably feel better in a little bit just need to relax feeling down today i have zero motivation and there are so many things to do i dont know whether this lack of motivation is my depression and anxiety or the meds i take whatever the causeim sick of it im giving up days months and years of my life to this i feel like just giving up there are no answers what can i do hope everybody is doing ok and hugs to all those that are struggling everyone not really that anxious today not doing anything stressful though hello and hugs to those that need them took a shower and went to church had lunch after that and did a lot of reading i was feeling anxious after church but decided to read and relax it seemed to have helped im still tired but not enough for a nap husband is sleeping now and ill wake him up shortly hes making this funky teriyaki chicken fried rice thing for dinner ive been helping with ideas and timing the cats are fed and dishes put away will do laundry either tomorrow or tuesday depending on when the kids want to do laundry i moved my photos from my camera to the computer but didnt work on them due to pain in my neck and shoulders so far im doing okay still jittery but okay im not anxious exactly more restlessshaking my legs and feet had an argument with my daughter last night not really an argument more her telling me i should try harder and i should be recovered by now i was so upset i took some klonopin and went to bed i must have taken too many because i couldnt wake up this morning hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling i wasnt overly anxious today by the way of panic attacks i didnt have any panic attacks today at all actually however i was kind of paranoid but i didnt feel that anxious when i was paranoid so im honestly not sure if anxiety is causing it or if it is something else hi all i had been isolating myself for so many years due to my chronic social anxiety that i was becoming so depressed and very close to suicide i decdied to do something about it and started going back to my mental health clubhouse where i have known alot there for years but would only drop in once a year or so i am now going on 4 days straight there its nice you get a free cup of coffee in the morning and lunch is only 50 and they have a free salad bar if you have no money and a snack bar to buy snacks and the day is structured around a work order day where u can work in the kitchen or in business doing data entry or reception answering phones there are alot of jobs and things to do and if u cannot or do not feel comfortable working they do not make you it runs from 7am till 330pm and they have people who will take you to the pharmacy to pick up meds and just a number of things they help you with they even have a small clothing store in the club where u can purchase clothes for a quarter each monday tomorrow will be day 4 and it feels so good to break out of my self made prison at home and get out i got to the point that i knew i was dying and was going to die and was getting super super depressed staying in the same clothes on the couch doing nothing everyday and just alone with my own thoughts and i decided i had to make a drastic change no matter how hard it would be i am no where near well but i am now trying to break out of that shell and trying hard not to be afraid of people and talking and realizing that i am just as valuable as they are this has been so good for my mental health and has got me eating on a regualr basis too because i am getting a decent lunch each day going there today i feel good about the changes i am making and i look forward to any feedback or advice or suggestions anyone else has about breaking out of the isolation and socializing  i could have written your post except the part about the mental health club for me its been going to the library with the express purpose of checking off my work task list i know how you feel i think the pain of staying the same outweighed the pain of changing for both of us heres to change seesaw pinkdiva42 overslept today so i didnt make it to the clubhouse today but tomorrow is another day and i am still feeling positive made it to clubhouse today i was one in three that showed up one of our major busses in this town was shut down due to the weather and so only three of us showed up but i was proud of myself for getting out of the house and not isolating myself another day tomorrow this is great unfortunately sometimes when it comes to socializing we have to take risks i dont generally have social anxiety in the normal sense but i dont like putting myself in uncomfortable situations i hang out with my friends a lot but theyre my friends i am less comfortable when it involves hanging out with people i dont know such as my friends bringing along their friends theres been times its worked out great and other times ive regretted it unfortunately its the only way we are ever going to meet new people though and risks will have to be taken what youre doing is great though and i hope youll meet some really awesome people pinkdiva42 first you should know that lice is really not a big deal of course anxiety doesnt allow that kind of thinking what i would suggest is buying a kit from the store to treat you and your girl friend for lice wash your sheets and clothes then relax for me at least that would give peace of mind another route would be asking your doctor to check for lice if you arent sure but you can find tutorials on youtube i was stopped by a couple people who tried to scam me with some fake antique coins although thats only an assumption on my part i was honest and helpful until they actually started talking about money at which point i hastily retreated after that i felt like  fortunately it was at the beginning of my daily walk which i sorely needed but i thought about going back home i was so rotten and you might think that its an unlucky exception but actually ive ever only been stopped by rude or unpleasant people and never for anything fun or useful i think part of it is just the way it works also my social anxiety makes pretty much any interaction with a stranger unpleasant and maybe it has a bit to do with living in russia which is notorious for grumpy people in certain circles i just started thinking how id avoid that crap is it better to lie that im in a hurry or i had this outlandish idea apologize in a foreign language which i actually speak of course although that seems a bit too extreme if not completely impossible in my state and i also dont look like a foreigner if that makes sense i also feel a lot like stopping walks and hiding at home again but that is bad for me however its no good if i have to relax after an activity that i was supposed to do to relax you dont require an excuse to not interact with a stranger have you tried just ignoring them and walking on i guess i should come to think of it i always keep stopping well i kind of often walk in deserted areas although today its not the excuse but still it was me those two guys and an empty street i guess its an even better excuse to keep going i mean they cant have done to me anything worse behind my back than what they tried face to face you just keep walking as though youre a machine do not stop ugh i get people trying to stop me downtown all the time i just keep walking most people do with all the people handing you cds or asking for money dont feel bad you dont owe anyone a response if your wear earphones people will assume you are listening to music and not bother you to avoid someone just tell them no thanks or avoid contact keep walking the thing is that i normally work from home but to make the office appear full for an audit they want me to come out for 2 days on 1920 apart from any other issues ive previously had panic attacks when i worked at the office at the start and i hate this job in general and it seems they dont particularly appreciate me either but also ive been surviving thus far by being able to listen to stuff on headphones while i work and i suspect i wont be allowed any such luxuries since its an audit so itll be just me and my demons its just 17 hours combined 6 hours of commute which might be worse since i dont know what the public transport conditions are at those hours nowadays and yet im damn terrified im also probably not going to eat at work because it makes me anxious eating around other people  other bodily functions oh not to mention that i regularly suffer from insomnia and lately havent been getting up that early anyway which im sure will add another layer to this  sandwich so wish me luck good luck with your awful sandwich we are cheering you on well its going to be  indeed ive been trying to change my sleep schedule and failing badly ive been falling asleep around midnight for a couple hours to then stay awake until around 5 again going to bed getting up around 78 to an alarm clock having breakfast to try to reset my internal clock then crashing until noon exhausted except today i havent even been able to fall asleep at midnight in short theres no way ill be functional at the required hours on the other hand i expect that my social anxiety and awareness will be numbed from being sleep deprived or maybe i wont feel sleep deprived because of anxiety well im going to stock up on stimulants which is probably going to be primarily dark chocolate unless i see anything better gotta get high before i go down  double post thats unfair pc when i have anxiety for this kind of thing i wish you the best of luck and hope it goes by quickly sending big hugs its over it actually went pretty smoothly at least on the outside i know that usually the reality is never as bad as your fears or at least my fears but its very hard to take this to heart or maybe im managing because i acted in some ways as if nothing really bad could happen such as leaving before everyone else although you have to consider the fact that i dread going home alongside almost complete strangers opened up my school elearning site i have to email a question or two to my poetry class instructor and i have to write a shakespearean style sonnet this is going to be fun went to another park this morning chipmunks were everywhere it was so cool also accidentally disrupted a softshell turtle from his morning out in the sun sorry about that turtle not too many butterflies out in the butterfly house but its still early anxiety kicked in around 1130 am picking up my new meds wednesday but wont get the latuda until next week ugh feeling really good today took a shower then went to float in the sunshine about to clean house and my bedroom yay im out of the recliner jennifer 1967 techie180 i am diagnosed with social anxiety disorder i thought i had depersonalisation disorder and general anxiety disorder but every psychiatrist i went to see told me that i had social anxiety and depersonalisation was a symptom of it ive been taking prozac for the past few months and it has been great i used other drugs before but none have had positive effects ever but with prozac i feel like another person now i am so much more talkative and a lot more relaxed sure i still have attacks sometimes but those dont bother me now and theyre not that strong now but daily stress wow thats over like a shelter in my brain shut tight i dont care anymore and i am a brand new person i even have a job that is all about talking to people ive never met like all day and im not bothered heres the thing although prozac has made me a better version of myself ive drugtaking problems honestly first few months ive been good i took every single day the amount that my pych told me to but today while drunk i took more i swear i have no idea why i may have wanted to see what happens this is not the first time im doing this ive never been suicidal my entire life i just want to take more also i know that this ssri is so good to me so theres no way that im stopping but i know that i should stop taking more than my psyc recommends also im developing a drinking problem hadnt had this in like two or three months i know i need help but my closest visit to my psychologist is like three weeks later and my psychiatrist prescribed 6 boxes of prozac and told me off till january so i cant really seek pro help right now so yeah help i know i need it i know its been awhile since you posted how are you doing im sorry you are experiencing this difficulty i wish i had a good suggestion for you here but i dont think i do might it be possible to give your meds to a family member to hold for you  just give you the amount you need to take each day i also wondered about the possibility of getting in touch with the mental health professionals in your life to let them know whats going on with you i know you wrote youve never been suicidal in your life but my own experience suggests to me that you may be building up to something here hopefully im wrong but the taking of more medication than youre prescribed plus the drinking sounds sortof like a kind of thinly disguised self abuse to me and again my own personal experience suggests to me that this sort of thing can be a harbinger of things to come again hopefully im just wrong about this but in my own case these are the sorts of things that eventually led to allout attempts to end my life each little thing inofitself didnt seem all that big a deal at the time but in retrospect i can now see where it was all leading anyway hopefully im just completely off the mark here but i felt like it was worth mentioning i wish you well what are the jobs like where you are could you easily find something different or are you stuck did a bunch of homework and three loads of laundry today had to stop because my neck and shoulders hurt so i read for a little bit managed to stay focused so i didnt feel the anxiety this time got a sore on my right leg that stings a bit my husband thinks it may be a spider bite i dont seem to have any other issues except it hurts and its a little red i usually have a spotted rash but not this time i didnt feel it until last night when it was itching keeping an eye on it just in case feel a bit nervous im starting to get a bit anxious about starting my new job tomorrow what will it be like how will i arrange the rest of my routine around it i dont know yet and its unnerving i really dont like people but they are drawn to me i am really bubbly and smiling laughing all the time only on the outside my life is so beautiful yet the ultimate disaster im completely lost alone stressed needing help on the inside but you will never see it looking at me hello jetlife welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit may i suggest you

day long its been good for me in some ways but i had to put a lot of work into managing my energy anonymous50007 mrsjetlife87 i can relate to you i dont need to be around people i dont need to be on facebook twitter or any other look at me im wonderful websites im only on pc and im 100 ok with that people in real life have done nothing for me they just pull me into their chaotic endless drama thats why i cut them all off thats why people like you and me are at our best when were not drowning in the sea of everyones mess they call life toodles im very similar i tend to care about people and want to help them but i dont understand them at all at i feel ok in a small group of people where everyone has passed my dangertrust test but at the end of the day i need a lot of time on my own only then i can fully relax and be myself when im with people all i can think of is how not to embarrass myself and what are they thinking of me all is revealed so i go to a new tdoc tuesday my current tdoc checked into her and said it looks like shed be a good fit im also trying to get an appt with a new pdoc affiliated with a private mental health facility here in town im going to see if it would help for me to go inpatient come off everything and start fresh cant keep going in and out of these attacks and depressions hope everyone is ok and hugs for those that are struggling do you think therapy could help with this i hope you get this resolved best wishes jennifer 1967 so in english we were set up in groups to talk about the book we read wed have to go up in front and speak and of course i was feeling like i couldnt do it but only one person from my group showed up so i just got up and did it yes it was only one person and my teacher so people would think this isnt that bad i got about half way through i still wanted to break down into tears i was shaking and it was hard to talk but i got through it i really dont know how i did it but i did and ill never have to do it ever again in my lifehopefully thats great celebrate small but still important victories good for you stage fright gets to me too this is why people who perform tell you to just picture the audience naked because then it shifts the idea of embarrassment to them in your mind yay good for you i dont know if this will help at all but it might so i want to share with you i dont talk much especially not in situations that are difficult such as therapy i have been with my current therapist a year now and still have sessions where i do not utter a word but we have found ways of working around this a huge part of me is living in a huge amount of fear too so i know it can be a terrible terrible world in the first instance i took in some writings and showed them to my t so she knew some of what i was dealing with as a client so she knew what i was looking for in a therapist patient quiet calm understanding use of nurturing touch when ready etc etc after that first session i know we spent several in a lot of silence and it is important to find a therapist that is comfortable with this because a lot a lot are not she tried to find ways of interacting with me and it worked slowly but surely she is used to working with children so i think that helped and we just sat and looked at flashcards or passed a ball between us played hunt the thimble played a game where i had to guess what i was holding without looking at it that took some trust that she didnt have anything horrible in her bag played a game where we drew shapes and the other had to make a picture out of it basically just interacting and through this there was a need for a few innocuous words to be spoken it helped after a while we found that i find writing things down much easier and so now i bring in things that i have written and will either read them or give them to her to read aloud mostly i also write instead of talking so some sessions she will be the only one using her voice as i write replies or comments it is very very very slow going so you really need a patient therapist but it is possible i had a therapist when i was 14 but the only thing they kept saying was i cant help you if you wont talk i took that to mean that i had to talk to be helped but i know differently now there is a way around this any therapist who says that is in my opinion substandard it is their problem their inability their uselessness as a therapist because it is they who cannot find a way to access this client to reach them to help them hope that helps in some way and please feel free to pm me if you would like any more info i dont know if i have selective mutism but i do choose not to talk an awful lot of the time when most probably would so i guess it would fit finished my homework for the week went to dermatology appt she gave me cortisone cream for my forehead and a pill to try and counter the mites im also getting a patch test done next month to see if my skin is sensitive to common chemicals in lotions shampoos etc itll be interesting to see that one spent about two hours waiting for meds got all of them except the pill for the mites that may be in by friday chilling out before making dinner anxiety was there at midday but not as bad i now have the lower dose of latuda so will see if that does anything jennifer 1967 didnt do too bad today but i have had a headache all day so that didnt help the lower dose of latuda seems to work i wasnt anxious that much but i was more tired worked a little bit on the photos but didnt get too far making dinner soon i took some advil for the headache but it hasnt kicked in ugh techie180 oh man i can relate to this ive always been extremely antisocial introverted depressed and never considered myself to be a people person but it seemed like everyone had high praises for me whenever i was working customer service boss fellow employees and customers themselves the only reason i pursued engineering is because i wanted to be in a field away from customers lol apparently my mixture of mellowness and straighttothepoint nature puts a lot of people at ease in reality im successfully trying to divert their attention away from me and towards the task at hand or their own personal life i guess its just because i listen more than i talk before engineering i looked into communications just to figure out how to talk to people because i was just that introverted i didnt like people growing up so i thought that if i just learned how to talk more i could meet better people but everyone seems to agree the ironic key to good communication is better listening skills so unless there is a goal in mind or someone else starts the engagement i dont want to break the ice maybe im too judgemental too shy dont know what to say or i just want to keep the nice silence ive gotten over some of my anxiety around people as i slowly realized just how much people dont notice or care about anything but themselves not saying everyone is narcissistic but that we all live in our own bubble of a brain and its difficult to interact outside of it ie everyone is their own island but i still dont like engaging with people on the off chance that i have to talk about my own personal life and bad situation  i think ive turned a corner with my depression and anxiety ive been up and out doing things with no anxiety i cried buckets of tears this week and it was cathartic im ready to let my daughter go i am at peace i feel good today hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling been busy today with getting groceries and waiting to pick up the antimite med food was expensive but we got it covered for a while the antimite med is weird i have to take six pills thankfully theyre small on an empty stomach like 1 hour before a meal i also have to order the next batch next wednesday since the pharmacy didnt order enough im anxious about next week fireworks arent my friends just coming through a period of severe depression and anxiety as ive saidim tired of this roller coaster ive scheduled an appointment with a new therapist since my old one is closing her practice and im going to get a second opinion from another psychiatrist have so much to catch up on hope everyone is ok and hugs for those that are struggling hugs fharraige fireworks arent my friends either hugs jennifer good luck with your new therapist the anxiety around this impending move nov 1st is subsiding with each hurdle jumped and cog in the wheel turned towards it happening it now really seems to be a reality the primary anxiety stemmed from a worry about an interruption to my mental healthcare that has been overcome check funds for the deposit and move itself check and several more checks to the list too well now i have been able to confirm that i will still qualify for my disability assistance until and during such time i transition back into the work place big check i am giving myself the freedom now to be somewhat relieved  and a whole lot happy jennifer 1967 i hope the move is hassle free or as hassle free as possible just im overly anxious to see my therapist today my therapy center receives state funding and my state government is shut down so some things are closed the newspaper said human services are open and the lady at the hotline my therapy center runs said she is probably in but im still a little fearful ill get there only to find an empty office i wish this anxiety would pass my stomach is in a knot i want to thank everybody for their encouragement and support when i wanted to give up the other day i really appreciate it youre a great group of people youre great too jennifer prolonged exposure therapy could help it would also help to talk about handling fears with your therapist i hate needles i cant stand to look when im getting blood drawn or when i need an iv the lab techs and nurses are good about letting me know when it happens so it isnt a surprise i hear you i went to bedfeeling tired and allbut then a thought popped into my head that is giving me total and complete anxiety and that led to another thoughtthings i need to take care of and the situations im dreading so much and so afraid of the outcomes that im having a fullblown anxiety attack and cant sleep i know i just need to go deal with these two things  one is signing my new lease and the other is calling the irs to deal with a back tax issue oh and calling ssa to deal with my medicare enrollment i know that once i deal with these issues that it will be fine its nothing i cant handlebut im so afraid that the outcome will somehow equate to my death and demise and the loss of everyone and everything i care aboutanywaysits keeping me up and i really need the sleep i have a rough week of deadlines ahead of me before i go away for the holidays seesaw breakforthelight strong anxiety again tonight i was off work sick a few days last week so its been five days at home the sitting at home alone has raised my anxiety not enough distractions and it makes it harder to go back to work tomorrow also those issues havent gotten 100 better yet but i feel a pressure that i have to go to work tomorrow to call in sick again i wouldve had to get a doctors note on friday and i didnt because i was sure id be better by monday and also because i dont want to go to a doctor with vague symptoms also havent been sleeping well all week which adds to my night time anxiety i went ice skating for an hour this morning and i felt tired all day afterwards logically i should have no trouble sleeping tonight but i have this strange body which sometimes even cant sleep because of yoga class in the evening i tried so hard i had my usual evening ritual of writing in my journal and then getting ready for bed i decided not to take my phone with me into the bedroom to use in case i couldnt sleep  because that would be assuming the worst and now here i am sitting on my couch and almost shaking so tired but feel too nervous to sleep  having digestion issues not sure if those issues are causing the nerves or if the nerves are causing the issues i just feel sooooooo tired and want to sleep chewing on some ginger hope thatll make me feel better sorry to hear that seems like just prolonging the agony my t has suspected that i may be on the asd spectrum too coincidentally and works with a few kids with it i believe fingers crossed he is understanding and fingers crossed your daughter can see him soon and start to build that relationship having days where you feel like you cant even get up let alone leave the house is horrible really horrible i am lucky in some respects that i live alone for a lot of the time so can do what i wantneed though sometimes that isnt a good thing thelittledidgee hi lavender i am a 57 year old woman and i suffer from the same symptoms as your daughter i used to be before the depression anxiety sleep disorder and also a bad case of hypothyroidism which has its own nasty corollaries an outgoing social person especially gifted at selling high end jewelry i was outdoorsy loved to travel alone often and excelled at making friends now i am isolated almost all of the time i am married but never had any childreni met my husband fairly late in life he is generally kind but very much a workaholic and not good at expressing or dealing with emotions he is remarkably unaffectionate and that really doesnt help i can understand where your daughter is coming from so well a gentle touch is what is needed lots of reminders of how much she is loved and supported by you makes an awful lot of difference i too become physically ill abdominal pain headaches and surprisingly powerful lower back pain have all been experienced when i have social interactions to attend on those occasions wild horses could not get me out of the house i have access to a wonderful gentle therapist but going to spend sessions with her has become so painful i can no longer bring myself to go yes i understand it is a resource i should not squanderand yes this causes me anxiety as well over the guilt i feel being trapped in this vicious cycle is to me often worse than the depression itself no i do not have one single explanation for its arrival in my life i think of it as i think of my depression brain chemistry running a little amuck there is no external single cause yes it all makes me very lonely at times but i am comfortable and safe in my home and for now thats how it has to be for me fortunately in my case i have an artistic side and do often naturally enjoy lots of time to myself in peace and quiet so its perhaps not as crippling a situation for me as it might seem on the surface i have taken baby steps to help myself and my medication does a bit for me in that way the most help i have gotten is talking with others about this and realizing i am not alone an 8week cbt course was also useful to me but came with its own share of difficulties some of the techniques i learned in it were very helpful however and do still help me now a few years on there is supposed to be an anxiety workbook famous because of its blue cover and wellreceived by therapists which has helped a great many people that may be a place to start i wish i could be more help but i wanted to reach out to let you know that it happens to very lovely peopleit is no fault of yours or hersand that little by little her pain and confusion can be greatly lessened and even possibly cured lots of people deal with this there is hope especially as she is so much younger than me and not yet soured or cynical about some things wishing you both all the best hopefully things will get better not worse i dont have any real words of wisdom but i hope you have some friends who are supportive of you that you can speak with i have learned that more people out there have anxiety about one thing or another than they let on so i have dealt with social anxiety disorder for as long as i remember i was officially diagnosed until a few years but i knew that i had it since i was a kid but anyways in school i have to do presentations and it causes me to have panic attacks which cause me to blank out and freeze and then i lose marks for my presentation so i have an iep and one of my accommodations is allowing me to do presentations privately for teachers but whenever i do teachers guilt me to present in front of the class saying you presented so well or people would love to listen to this or your presentation is so interesting that people will enjoy it or something along these lines and it frustrates me i know people may love it or that i presented so well but thats because i am accommodated if i am not i get severe panic attacks the last time i had a performance for my exam i just ended up taking my medication before my presentation and it seemed to help at least the preperformance anxiety but i hate being guilted into doing presentations for the classpeers as it makes me extremely anxious people just dont understand that this isnt something i can control or want i am a lot better than i was years ago but still have a long way to go in terms of treatment oh yeah totally understand if it were me id feel like i had to do it to please the teacher and that would cause me even more stress thinking id let them down it is annoying but you just have to do whats best for you i find people do have real difficulty understanding mental illness unless theyve experienced it i think they are just trying to encourage you in case you want to try itnot to guilt you into doing it if you dont want to what they realize is a lot of jobs later in life require some presentation skills so its a good thing to learn but if you cant then dont feel bad about it scarlett35 hi scarlet im wondering if you could practice with a few ppl perhaps family or close friends that would help get started if you did one good presentation it would give you the confidence to keep going i used to be similar and i started to learn off my presentations by heart and gained confidence that way i needed to attend a wedding shower last night my husband didnt tell me until the last minute that worked out ok this time i didnt have enough time to go over all the what ifs in my head until i get there then i didnt know but one couple and i stayed off to myself until we could leave im hoping the extra anxiety ive been having the past week will go away as i get more used to prozac i think the anxiety definitely started after the prozac was increased i wish i could watch tv here id have to turn the volume way up to hear it and id have to sit right in front of the tv to read the captions i wish i were out in space with unlimited food drinks and snacks and a big flat screen tv and netflix and hulu its a good thought anyway my mom is sick and im very anxious abt thismy therapist says to concentrate on the progress she is making but i cant stop feeling worriedwhat can i do to bring myself back to normalcy so that i can care for her better anxiety wins i had an important meeting today and i emailed them last night to cancel everything about that situation was giving me anxiety and i felt completely sick my therapist and i had gone over a planstrategy to get me through it but i tossed that aside instead ive laid in bed under my weighted blanket petting my dog avoiding the world ive learned that some days are like this i chose not to fight my anxiety today and thats okay tomorrow is a new day sharing this in case you get hard on yourself like i normally do we will all have bad days and its okay sometimes strength is knowing when you just need a little more self love you can try staying in the present moment so youre not thinking about the past or future this will help you tremendously im starting to watch videos on youtube on mindfulness meditation i think it will help you im sorry shes sick i went through this with my mom i think allowing yourself to be sad is helpful too so many times we repress our feelings and i think that causes more problems than we need i wish you many days of joy ahead you can look for the good in each day and make great memories wherever possible xo i hear you yesterday was one of those days for me thank you for posting this im living in a new town and in dire need of friends i cant stand feeling so isolated but all i can think about is what might go wrong imaginary arguments with imaginary strangers its making me crazy i hope you can make some new friends are there group activities you can join for me it helped to join a club soccer team because i could focus on soccer but still be around people i know that it is hard to meet new people when you have social anxiety i went to a lunch last week for teachers at my school and ended up talking to a new teacher i was hating it on the inside but managed it by asking her lots of questions try meetup it doesnt matter as much if you never have to see the people again i agree that joining a group can take the spotlight off you and allow you to make friends thats what helped me make friends good luck making friends sending big hugs glad it helped you jennifer the cold has advanced to headache sore throat and now a runny nose and watery eyes thankfully the kids are over it so it should go away here soon the supplies for the roof came in this afternoon unfortunately the weather isnt cooperating rain today and tomorrow sunny for the weekend then rain on monday and tuesday so im crossing my fingers and toes for wednesday i finished my homework for the week good thing because im not thinking very well with this cold raging on anxiety is up a little biti wish i could quit worrying about getting everything right soive suffered from social anxiety years before iknew what it was i just knew iwas extremely shy to the point of being afraid 18 now im well aware of what it is and have tried therapy medications and self medicating everyone makes me uncomfortable friends family my boyfriends over the years one friend ive known for over 6 years and still there are times when even she makes me uncomfortable the depression accompanying my anxiety and to help it suffocate me i just wanna breathe again how can you tell if youre anxiety is the one and only cause its like its so easy for everyone else to enjoy life am ithe only one ive always wanted to be a social butterfly and love meeting new people for the first time but after the first few times i start to feel obligated to have that person in my life though i cant bring myself to socialize regularly sometimes i really hate myself because im sure people think i feel some way towards them but its all in my head i can talk to my boyfriend at times about how im feeling i like that he always reponda with i understand and it makes me feel good then i start thinking does he really or is he just saying that to sooth whatever anxious feelings im having so we dont have to continue talking about it i feel like a consistent burden to him with a fear of people i almost never feel theres any reason to keep going hidihi hi socialhandicap101 im sooo sorry to hear how youre feeling however you are not alone most ppl will feel awkward in company at some point or time in their lives they just cover it up better than the rest of us do the fact that your boyfriend stays around means that you are more than your social anxiety he sees beyond your anxiety and loves you regardless im wondering if you have tried any therapies like homeopathyacupunctureeft etc etc any of these are bound to help as well as the talking therapies sassandclass roofers came out to do a small part today theyre going to work the weekend so they have better weather neighbor has her dogs loose off her yard and of course they run to where the roofers are then she walks through my yard with her dogs on a leash i wonder if this is a battle worth fighting because she isnt even supposed to have dogs there at all according to the hoa rules weve gotten hit with stuff from the hoa so dont know if i want to make a bad situation worse cold is getting worse the pain has spread to my lower sinuses and i can barely breathe through my nose going to be real fun with the cpap we may have leftovers tonight or go out to eat unless i can convince my husband to make spaghetti probably not at least i was able to relax and read today anxiety is up but it should go away in a little while  hope you feel better soon and breathing gets easier i dont like feeling pressured to go places no one around me really gets me i truly feel that way im just not capable of doing what other people can do it is what it is if youve known me for years it should be obvious by now i cant handle what the average person can handle i am weak and i am afraid its the way i have always been no surprises there its like i was just built to break i dont have any mental health problems diagnosed anyway related to this but i think i might have social anxiety but im not sure bookworm257 i am not sure if it is normal but i am in the same boat i guess i have friends but they are friends where we are together like at work i have a hard time meeting people it is awkward and i dont know what to say to me there are two types of friend  communication one seems so superficial hi how are you hows the family how was whatever the second is intiment not like talking about sex but whats inside how i really feel but can you join a group that does something that interests you do you already have something in common it probably be pretty safe and you can work through some of the anxiety jennifer 1967 i understand that feeling lotusblossom i used to be able to but after the breakdown im as fragile as spun glass anxiety level is rather high today it was bad enough that i was shaking involuntarily enough that others noticed one asked what was wrong all this because i put myself in a social situation i really didnt want to be in still it was the right thing to have done i just loathed doing it i was quite anxious earlier today this is unusual as i have happily been anxiety free for months while yes i have been nervous or on occasion worried it is the numbing disabling anxiety that occurred this morning basically i volunteered for a large event it turned out i was redundant while the job really only required one person there were four of us present which meant standing around stupid yes but such situations make me anxious part of it is that i dont want to be seen to be standing around doing nothing it is so unprofessional part of it too is that the silly chit chat that occurs in such situations makes me uncomfortable i feel like such a tool i was getting overwhelmed so i asked to go home but this wasnt entirely a relief as i feel guilty for bailing on the others still sick now with a cough im hopeful because usually when i start coughing the cold is just about over roofers finished the back part of the house theyre doing the front tomorrow hopefully before the storms hit in the late afternoon spent most of the day reading i finished one book but i still have a few i havent read yet daughters boyfriend is making spaghetti for dinner its good because i can use some comfort food without me sniffling over the stove anxiety is okay considering physically i feel like crap its back to the event later this morning and i am not doing well i am apprehensive and bracing myself for disaster in reality i know it should be better as i am actually scheduled to perform specific activities and tasks still i worry about my ability and performance i have such a high standard of perfection for myself i must remember i am only just a volunteer actually started feeling better this afternoon i missed church this morning though because i wasnt feeling that well roofers are still working they were halfway done on the back and they are also working on the front hope they will be done here soon because were supposed to get rain tonight did a bunch of homework for my orientation class i also looked over the weeks work for my poetry class i should knock that out in a day or so anxiety isnt too bad just what i usually have for doing homework worrying if i had done it right pretty soon itll be finals week i havent been here in a long time but ive been doing relatively well and am going up the latter at my job and have been talked to a couple times about becoming a manager but im not sure i want that or not gives me a lot less anxiety over if im gonna be in trouble or something which never happens but still then it means i have to set an example for everyone else and be in charge which im not good at im good at my job but just because of my ability to disassociate when i do things i dont like i can do it for hours pretending to care about the customers at all and robotically moving around anyways im back because im having my first bout of anxiety in a while started getting nauseous again and cant sleep hoping i will be back to normal in the morning the large fair i volunteered at has come to an end i was anxious through most of it sure working the childrens activities was fun but i had a tremor so bad people commented on it homework is almost done except for one piece that im waiting on others for roofers are almost done they have one piece left hope it doesnt rain too bad still havent picked another book yet but i have plenty ive been eating crazy amounts of food today been wound up a bit trying to calm back down not as anxious as usual today i think the extra xanax my doctor gave me is helping a bit had a panic attack yesterday but i know what it can be attributed toan overwhelming to do list separation anxiety from my daughter and my car breaking down when i know ill need it to take my daughter to orientation next monday and tuesday im a little on edge right now hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling im 48 years old ive lived my entire life feeling stresseduncomfortableawkwardsad i now suffer from ulcerative colitis  hypertension  sleep disorders the cumulative effect of these issues have left me feeling hopeless im pretty much living just waiting to die ive had a little therapy but didnt see it helping now i feel ashamed that im so mentally weak dont see any way possible to get better robert hello robert this appears to be your first thread here on pc so welcome to psychcentral im sorry you feel so hopeless hopefully coming here to pc can be of some comfort  support i know how you feel  im 69 and ive also lived my whole life feeling stressed uncomfortable awkward  sad plus in my case as a consequence ive left a long trail of destruction behind me the memories of which i now have to live with ive tried seeing a few therapists herethere none of it ended up being of any benefit at this point ive prettymuch just retired from the world except for the time i spend here on pc oh  i practice yoga  do some

loud enough to not be drowned out by the tv i feel so broken down and helpless its just making the anxiety worse i just want to be left alone but im scared someone will come over bit anxious today classmates still havent done their input for the team assignment its due tonight at 1130 pm i hope they jump in because i may end up doing all the work myself if they dont roofers didnt finish yet theres two small areas to knock out though so itll be done in the morning kids are back and watching the office husband is cooking pork chops tonight having bad anxiety and panic attacks today as it gets closer to my daughter leaving for college the more anxious i get am trying coping techniques and they are not working neither is my medication i feel paralyzed with fear right now hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling sassandclass my anxiety was bad this morning i couldnt sleep for a while we had a bad thunderstorm move in overnight and this morning it took out the transformer for the building we were without power for about 4 hours i couldnt sleep until it came back on and its left me feeling off all day i feel awful when i get them too sorry they have come back for you hope they stop soon take care one classmate just checked in she doesnt understand the assignment i hope i explained it to her dont know if shell get it before friday when we have to post our conclusions to the whole class i have a feeling im going to do all the legwork this makes me nervous otherwise its been a quiet day did some reading made dinner still have to take a shower in a bit anxiety is up but to be expected at this moment and the roofers are finally done now we have to pay for it everyone im anxious to see my therapist this happens every week i dont get why im even scared i guess i just dont trust her yet also im afraid of working through my trauma and my trauma gives me anxiety okay so i guess i do get why im scared i just needed to type that out im sorry youre having a tough time would a therapist be helpful in processing some of this things can get better thinking of you its a new group an old friend created it for an event hence i get to talk to new people i decided topicrelated to advertise a remix i made and asked to like and subscribe the video if they liked the remix i also said i will also gladly accept criticism with a smiley i got no responses and started overthinking probably out of anxiety did they not like it did my message look like one of those spam messages some people send to many groups at once from this point i will say i did intend to personally share it with the new group though i wanted to fulfill my interest of growing my subscription number to fulfill a current desire to be recognized for what i do do they think im selfish now was my message garbage am i garbage or selfish for sharing my remix this way i feel kinda garbage after seeing no one responding you can post your remix here and i will definitely give you feedback i am an edm djproducer as well as mobile dj thanks i appreciate it however its not the issue but the whole package of stressful thoughts i had yesterday feeling better today no anxiety and my daughter is 2 hours away at six flags with her friends she stayed on the mountain with her father last night and im doing ok i think the anxiety will probably come and go until ive fully adjusted but i feel hopeful today that it wont kill me hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling glad youre feeling better jennifer today was mostly stress eating that sucks my classmate finally chimed in on the team assignment and i have another part done ill turn in the class assignment tomorrow ive been rather nervous since both my daughter and my husband were at school most of the morning i dont know why its hitting now since its now over halfway through the term doing well today so far went down to the pool early this morning and floated while i mapped out my day in a pretty good and have motivation and energy today to tackle my to do list fingers crossed hope everyone is doing well and hugs for those that are struggling homework is done for this week looked over next weeks stuff it doesnt look too bad one of my other classmates sent me an email about how we seem to be the most productive for this orientation class well everybody has reasons but motivation and attitude are important too finished putting the dishes away this morning just chilling out and reading until dinner my husband is roasting a chicken so ill have to come up with a side dish anxiety is still up a bit only have a few more weeks of school also have patch test for my skin starting on monday and i spoke to soon i am having a panic attack anxiety im afraid and have an impending sense of doom i am paralyzed with fear and have a sense of dread about being unable to do anything i think it will come and go until i adjust if i could just overcome this fear and start doing something i think id be ok i hate anxiety thanks for bearing with me she leaves the 23rd and ill start adjusting hope everyone is doing well and hugs to all those that are struggling took a shower and went to church this morning picked the chicken from last night and did homework until dinner time anxiety is up still i think i did the assignment for orientation correctly but my writing is now horrific and it hurt my hand to write notes for over four hours we werent allowed to use the computer to write up our notes i still should be okay looked at poetry class assignment  final exam is another 700 word essay i dont remember a final for the orientation class just chilling out now will venture back into the fray tomorrow after i get the patches put on in the morning my anxiety has lasted for a few hours now it wont go away i will take my medication in hopes that it will help alleviate my anxious self i tried using all sorts of coping skills but it hasnt helped angelique67 a source of new anxiety for me is that now that were 3 in one room theres no where left for doing a quick washing up the bathroom has 5 or 6 people having to juggle and decide when and where to do our washing up i really wish i could go home or to that assisted living place if its horrible there maybe i can hire a lawyer to see what i can do i really hope this isnt the end of my life but if it is at least it isnt that far away to wait hi guys i just signed in on impulse as the last week has really hit home the enormity of my situation and im wondering what to do about it well im severely socially anxious and agoraphobic i need my mother with me when im out but i also need her with me just to talk to somebody today i went to the doctors for my blood test results and a home hairdresser came for a consultation about my brass problem i feel really angry with myself about the way i talk and my body language ive known this is a problem for years but im sick and tired of it now and im desperate to get a new lease of life going i talk and act very adolescent im 27 i bumble i mumble i fidget im not articulate i look angsty and feel it too and im very uncomfortable i feel like a teen whos self conscious in her new body and angsty hormonal mind and i can feel myself displaying that body language i hunch i shuffle my feet very ungracefully practically stomp when i walk and i talk in an unclear way when im very anxious and upset i look quite severe and moody and it doesnt help that my face looks younger than i am so i feel like i just scream teenager im so scared and uncomfortable and i lack social skills i want to move and speak the way other adults do its hard to explain what i mean but i watch them i watch other women when im out they wear more grown up clothes i do love my ripped jeans and floral vans though they walk more feminine and maturely they speak clearly with no confusion no awkwardness they seem to have more grace even if theyre not graceful i think the hairdresser really reminded me of how differently i move and speak she wasnt a glamazon like many hairdressers she was a perfectly nice ordinary woman in practical day clothes but she spoke clearly she spoke confidently its hard to explain but she had that adult way that i want i want to speak clearly too i want grown up mature body language right now as i have been for over 10 years im a high school kid hunched and hiding behind her hair eyes darting around laughing nervously how can i change it im meant to be getting a support worker but its been 2 months or more and i still havent heard from anyone despite my therapists looking into it i thought maybe she could help me but i dont know how i feel like what i need is selfcontrol mindfulness a good strong dose of diazapam role play could someone work with me to help me learn body language speech social skills i see the way other people interact as adult and proper and i want to have those speech and body languages skills too like an actual functional adult but i dont know how to learn it or who can help the therapist im seeing right now is psychoanalytic on the nhs were just looking at my past ive mentioned my body languageteenage speech to others who have worked with me in the past but they just ask me what i mean by teenagery and then laugh ill stop here as i do have a habit of writing a lot hello piglette i dont know as there is much of anything tangible i could offer with regard to this but i noticed no one had replied to your post so i thought i would below are links to three articles from the psychcentral archives on the subject of building self esteem plus a link to family therapist kati mortons playlist on building selfconfidence i realize some of this may not be especially relevant to your particular situation however perhaps somewhere in this material you may find some tidbits that will be of benefit to you i wish you well wrote another 5 pages worth of notes for my orientation class have to write more tomorrow but my right hand is kind of sore nothing up for the poetry class yet i might have to do some of that work and take my chances patches are on now nothing is really itching burning or stinging but i have a day and a half more to go if something is bothering my skin it would be nice to know cant sweat a lot or take a shower for three days im hiding in our bedroom because it has a mobile ac unit and the room is kept cool sucks for sleep habits but better than doing this test again we will probably have takeout for the next few days because my husband is also doing lots of homework and neither one of us wants to cook when our brains are fried plus the kitchen gets really hot anxiety is still up but i have only a few more weeks of school and ill probably chill until next term i think i did pretty good at orientation today considering they split my daughter and i up on a campus with 30000 students the first 4 hours i was trying hard not to hyperventilate but i eventually calmed down get to go back and do it all over again tomorrow hope everyone is ok and hugs for those that are struggling since theres been a third person in our room i cant do a sponge bath in the room and its hard to use the shower but i dont shower everyday im afraid to see the shower in the assisted living place and what if theres two or more to a room there finished my orientation class homework and half of my poetry class homework will finish the rest of it tomorrow ill also have the patches taken off tomorrow so waiting to see what comes out of that at least ill be able to take a shower tomorrow still a bit anxious will need to work on finals essay and start building a manuscript for poetry class tomorrow having a good day just starting a 3week vacation anxiety is not kicking up right now which is good because i absolutely couldnt handle both depression and anxiety right now was feeling anxious and depressed this morning but went to float in the pool that usually makes me happy and helps me work out issues hugs for all those that are struggling anxiety is the worst thing to deal with and so is loneliness which probably doesnt help the anxiety i hope all here can get through their days untouched by these 2 things i know i do it every day good luck everyone final evaluation of the patch test showed im sensitive to chamomile and similar plants and to lanolin the dermatologist emailed me a very long list of products i could use ill have to look over my products and see whats what also saw t today we talked about stuff that happened this week and how much better i am on my current meds i have been stable for about a year now as far as bipolar and borderline is concerned havent done any homework yet because of errands will do tomorrow anxiety is up a little but manageable next two weeks will be interesting to anyone who doesnt suffer from anxiety this is going to sound very pathetic i attended an appointment today ive put it off many times over the last 6 months my heart was racing my head was pounding i was sweating had a headache  was physically sick when i got to the car park i saw a very nice  kind lady yet my body reacted like i was about to get killed by a tiger after some tears  a shaking body i managed to get through the appointment i took a while to recover afterwards but i managed it im so proud of myself sassandclass thank you sassandclassthe pool does calm me down and make me feel better im going to be relying on it heavily im taking my daughter to college tomorrow at this time no anxiety and depression or tears i hope that doesnt change thank you for being supportive and letting me get this out hugs for all of those that are struggling fharraige how good is xanax hi everyone im struggling at the moment with what i think could be some form of social anxiety and wondered if anyone had any advice i had a quick look at the forum and couldnt see anything recent that fit with my scenario please bare with me as it might take a bit of explaining since i started my masters ive been having recurring bouts of anxiety surrounding my identity not in terms of what hobbies and films etc that i like more in terms of personality when i began my masters i was thrust into a really odd environment where my old lecturers or teachers became more like colleagues i really struggled to fit in and felt like i was really boring and no one was interested in me as i result i tried everything to modify my personality to make myself more interesting so i could be loved by everyone i found certain things triggered me and it was things like watching movies where the character was well liked so for instance i love the film tangled but whenever i watched it i wanted to be like rapunzel because everyone loved her when i watch lost i want my personality to be like hurley because everyone loves him i know this probably sounds really bizarre but it honestly triggers the confusion over my identity this has been going on for about 2 years now but it makes me feel so awkward as well when im in this confusing period i dont feel very sure of myself and i feel awkward like everyone knows im being fake and not authentic i dont even know how to act when im just sitting down im worried i look awkward dont know what to do and that everyone is judging me when i talk to people im absolutely desperate to be myself but im more desperate to be liked this now not only happens with my colleagues but also with friends who i dont feel comfortable with i also find myself getting hot sweaty and nervous when im in these situations i know i have too much dependence on what other people think of me and i cant seem to shift it i think it comes from low self esteem and not thinking that im good enough trying all these different identities tires me out and at the end of the day i just want to be myself but ive worn so many personalities mine has actually got lost in there somewhere i just want to learn who i am so i can be that person or there abouts all the time when i say that to people though they say everyone acts different around different people but i feel so anxious and it seems to affect me more than other people i actually know that im probably doing a selffulfilling prophecy and that because i dont know how to act i stay quiet or am awkward and then people dont like me as much i know that if i were myself people would probably like me more anyway i also know that people wont always like me and that some dont now and that i have to just live with it i just dont know how to rediscover myself im grouchy and stuff because i dont want to live my whole life being a fake i want to be my real self and be sure of who that is and confident so i dont feel awkward i dont want to worry what others think about me but i cant stop any tips advice thank you so much hello alisando well one way to look at this is simply that graduate school is stressful and perhaps what youre experiencing is simply a symptom of high levels of underlying stress  anxiety and if thats the case then perhaps what you need to do is to focus on ameliorating this underlying anxiety if you can successfully treat that via therapy for example the concerns you have about learning who you are  being that person around other people may gradually disappear on their own beyond that you know i read a lot of posts here on pc and not an insignificant number of them involve concerns similar to yours related to how to make friends how to keep friends how to be yourself  still have friends etc i should mention im an older person now and i lead a pretty thoroughly solitary lifestyle myself it wasnt always that way so anyway ive done some thinking with regard to these types of concerns and what occurs to me is that friends comego during some periods of a persons life they may have some during other periods they may have few or none at least thats the way it was for me before i simply withdrew from the world entirely so the point to which my thinking on this subject has brought me is perhaps a person would be best served by simply forgetting about friends  instead focusing on finding something in life she is passionate about  pursuing that with abandon maybe its a vocation maybe its an avocation but whatever it is put your time  energy into that  forget about the other stuff in the end theres really no concrete answer to those sorts of concerns anyway in the course of pursuing what you love youll of necessity come into contact with likeminded people and at least a few of them are likely to become acquaintances or even friends but even if they dont youll still have the satisfaction of having dedicated yourself to something thats important to you at least these are my thoughts with regard to your post i wish you well leejosepho i loved the answers thank you i do agree too i have been doing a lot of hobbies recently but i dont have too much time to do them as im so busy working on my masters the hobbies do help i took up painting recently and also had some worries about identity surrounding my art work wanting to get myself across but then also being inspired by other artists and wanting to be as good as them i think definitely the stress has really got to me im not too far from the finish line now so im hoping once its over ill feel better i just need to make sure im not people pleasing when i decide what i want to do next and do what i want to do for myself i liked what you said about having friends even when being yourself i think with the friends im talking about and the ones i feel least comfortable with we were all thrown together at school and so we have a wide range of interests and i dont feel as interesting to those people as i do to the ones i feel comfy with thank you for the reply i really appreciate it its good to vent these things sometimes i feel you lived my life the same way ive said the last few times that i am okay i have not quite been honest the truth is that i still experience bone crushing anxiety that cripples me i volunteered a few weekends ago and my anxiety impacted my ability to perform and do the job it was awful a few ore weeks ago i had some business at a bank to do for my support group i couldnt fill out any of the forms ive a camping holiday coming up and i am already anxious about getting an early start i had a function to go to yesterday and i was sick to the pit of my stomach okay though generally speaking i am quite good i am functioning well i can do my groceries or go to public places without a panic i can walk about my apartment building mail laundry etc with no problem it seems then to only be those things i am expected to perform that are causing the trouble hello just want to talk with some others about selective mutism and if it still effects you in your adult life or how its gotten easier when i was a child my selective mutism was so awful i wouldnt be able to ask to go to the toilet and would pee my pants in class when asked a question i would just sob because i was unable to speak a few times i would find things so hilarious but would not even be allowed to laugh and would just choke silently i find selective mutism to be really strange because some part of our brain is making rules for us that we have to oblige to ive never found anyone i could talk to about this properly im 21 now i still have crazy bad social anxiety and for the past  5 years or so i havent been able to make facebook statuses what about you guys hello kancles im sorry i cant comment with regard to your concerns however i noticed this is your first post here on pc so to psychcentral from the skeezyks may the time you spend here be of benefit psychcentral is a great place to get information as well as support for mental health issues the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are social groups you can join  chat rooms where youll be able to connect with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved lots of great stuff so please keep posting hi all after lots of life and therapy much of my social anxiety is mostly under control but i still have problems with when i need to talk to people from other groups at work like if i need their help i always feel like im bothering them and yet they seem to be fine and even enjoy the interaction once were talkingits clearly not a rational thought and i suppose im falling prey to mind readingcbt in thinking ahead about the interaction or what they are thinking but i was wondering if any of you have tips for when you sort or have to interact with coworkers because you need help with something hello  i know what you mean when it comes to talking to people and feel like youre bothering them i work in fast food so communication is a must in my environment so in a way i was conditioned into talking with my coworkers when i needed help but i do remember feeling nervous asking for help when i first started working and i still fall short when it comes to having casual conversations through my experience i have found that if i didnt ask for help i ended up becoming extremely flustered and anxious and i find that its not worth the trouble but when i did ask things ran much smoother and i felt happier in the end with that said i have two tips that i think will help you out first if you really need help but feel nervous talking to your coworker tell yourself that youll feel so much better once heshe responds give yourself reasons why you should ask for help inspire yourself second to start feeling comfortable asking your coworkers its best to try building a good relationship with them start by saying hello and goodbye itll make you feel more comfortable in approaching them later on and may perhaps kickstart a conversation remember even the most successful people in the world need help i really hope this helps you out with your coworkers i feel its a lot easier to talk to my coworkers then people in my group who also have mental illness i still dont talk to my coworkers a lot though if that makes sense yay i got my daughter off to college with no anxiety or panic attacks we took two cars and i did cry going and coming but i was positive and upbeat with her while we were fixing up her room then i hugged her for a long time and left i feel okay yay hope everyone is okay and hugs to those that are struggling kids came back to town with the daughters boyfriends family theyre having a funeral for the familys cat that died this weekend she was very old 19 i think and had some issues but at least now shes at peace and in no pain finished my homework for poetry class and through half of my homework for my orientation class also cleaned up the kitchen for a little bit and showed my husband how to use the convection part of our microwave been a quiet day otherwise still trying to keep the stress down since were getting closer to finals i just watch a show on the computer to keep calm some anxiety today some stressing out for starters theres that matter of payment for my kayak ive droned on about i am also finding out i need to tread lightly when it comes to talking about my coming move i really am happy about it and want to let people know but circumstances require i step rather softly we cant have my boyfriends boarder finding out before notice is required to be given the fact the boarder is best friends with some of his family members means keeping this a secret i am trying to recall to whom ive already let the cat of the bag and then there is the start of my holiday im sure ive posted somewhere on here my irritation at having a side stop thrust upon me for an upcoming road trip to our camping destination what was to be a 45hr drive has been extended to a 6 or 7 hour day and i am not happy about it i am really quite anxious about not getting an early start considering this extra travel time having a difficult time with anxiety again today i actually took my shovel and dug a drainage ditch yesterday afternoon in hopes the hard work would break me out of this it didnt i am intensely excited about moving 10 days 12 hours 34 min away did i memtion i was excited lol but i am wound up with anxiety that something is going to go wrong i wrote a little poem on selective mutism and dissociation on my activism blog tattoo reads when words become inadequate i  blogging in shadows long before i knew what the words mutism and dissociation meant i knew i used to often dream in sign language which i was never taught one of my alters mainly communicates this way still worried about my husband he overheated badly on saturday and has felt unwell since then saw his neurologist this afternoon and hell need another mri to rule out a ms flare im nervous about this because i have to drive while he is sedated i have had panic attacks driving so not a comfortable feeling i picked my poem for my final essay and found some research on it on wikipedia so now i have to figure out how to analyze it daughters boyfriends idiot brother wants to plant a marijuana seed over the familys cats grave its at his parents house so they would get in trouble for it hes really gungho about it too stupid jerk went out early for dinner to have a break food was pretty good then we just chilled out for a while other than the concerns about my husband im doing okay updatehusbands mri is on saturday i somewhat know where its at so driving back wont be an issue i hope he is starting to feel better but not out of the woods yet otherwise a slow day i started writing my outline for my final essay but having trouble concentrating anxiety is still up and when im anxious i cant focus may have to take some extra vistaril to get through this i do feel anxious for tomorrows smoke breaks cant wait but its definitely anxiety just hope the tank doesnt break justafriend306 jennifer 1967 no money yes but screw it i start my holiday this weekend with or without it i am not going to let it drag me down if it mean the difference between ziplining and not ziplinin so be it ill have a campfire and beach to enjoy anyway everything set up for tomorrow spent this morning writing part of my essay i figure if i can do small chunks of it ill have it done and revised before the deadline its not due until the end of next week still debating if i want to do next term i havent been used to this level of anxiety in a long time and i dont want to jeopardize my stability other than writing and three loads of laundry its been a peaceful day will be making dinner soon sassandclass doing really well anxiety wise had panic attacks last monday and tuesday last weekat orientation for my daughters college but nothing since praise the good lord i hope it lasts i hope everyone is doing ok and sending big hugs for those that are struggling husband went through his mri okay we will know the results on monday right now hes sleeping off the ativan if he goes too long ill have to pick up my daughter from work and i dont know how late shes working her store stays open until 10 pm on saturdays and id rather not be on the road with a bunch of crazy drunk fools but i gotta do what i gotta do didnt work on the essay because i forgot my laptop ill skip church tomorrow to work on it anxiety is crazy high but i have extra vistaril and maybe some patience just trying to stay chill i wasnt anxious all daynow its starting to kick in and i dont wanna waste my meds so i am just gonna sit through it and wait for it to pass jennifer 1967 uhmno glad youre feeling better uhmno finished half the essay today will have more than enough words once i get done im having to miss some stuff so it wont get too wordy and long the orientation class homework isnt too bad but it will be more writing this will be a fun week making spaghetti for dinner because i want comfort food and my husband doesnt want to drive to pick up last minute stuff hes studying for his finals in fact just about everyone in the house is doing finals stuff except for the cats anxiety is still up there but im pacing myself so its manageable i noticed something interesting when i went to college orientation for those 2 days in july the parents were separated from the students within an hour of being there i had taken my anxiety meds as usual but had nothing on hand poor planning i started having terrible panic attacksshaking heart pounding shortness of breath i felt stuck i didnt want to embarrass myself or miss valuable information so i kept taking deep breathes and talking myself through it i felt it was my only option when i have anxiety or panic attacks at home or in other places i am desperate to stop it and will take enough of my prn medication to stop it i proved to myself those two days that i can work through it and dont need to feel desperate to stop it when it happens since my doctor put me on abilify ive had little to no anxiety thank the good lord but i now understand i can work through it without freaking out i n ever had too many friends and in middle school i always sat alone at lunch the truth is i really dont mind i know humans are a social species but i dont want friends i dont like socializing and i like to isolate myself in my room at home typically my parents keep bugging me to make friends and be social but the truth is thats just so stressful to me i really just prefer being on my own i recently made a friend at school and ill talk to her in class sometimes but even though we have the same lunch i never sit with her i just sit by myself and i really dont mind sitting alone is it normal to want to isolate myself so much i dont have diagnosed social anxiety but i do freeze up and get anxious talking to people i dont know hello bookworm well im an older person  i lead a prettymuch solitary lifestyle i suspect its less outoftheordinary for a person my age than it would be for a younger person i dont really know if it is normal in either case i personally dont see anything wrong or worrisome about it its just the way you  i are could it be a sign of some underlying depression  social anxiety yes i suppose it could these are things ive certainly struggled with over the years but as long as youre comfortable with the way you live your life my perspective is its perfectly fine i guess the only other consideration may be that as you plan for your future  what kinds of employment opportunities you may wish to pursue it will be important to keep your preference for keeping to yourself in mind there are certainly occupations that require a lot of interpersonal contact  others where although it may not be integral to the completion of your assigned tasks its still an important part of advancing your career homework is done for this term kids and husband took their final exams and did really well were enjoying the short breather before next term my husband and i were talking about finals anxiety and how it affects us physically as well as mentally his double vision started to kick in a remnant of his ms before his exam but he calmed himself down he wants to go on ativan but his pdoc cant do it the office also does substance abuse rehab so they dont carry it went to pain management clinic and set up an initial appointment will see them monday morning i hope they can figure something out because bending still hurts picked up groceries and did a load of laundry today still need to do some housework but not today will be making dinner shortly anxiety is not as high as it has been but i wonder if i can still do school it keeps me going and gives me structure but the anxiety is a bit trying at times not doing so well today which is a bummer the last few days have been fantastic but somehow this evening everything started to spiral out of control i feel and think my co workers are conspiring and talking about me behind my back i know this may not be true but not sure the problem with this is the thoughts lead me to become incredibly anger and i dont want to get violent based off false beliefs that really hold no weight also just a few minutes ago while smoking on my front porch i killed a black window ortho home defense works really well btw now since i have my son this weekend i cant help but to think what may have happened had he been here or what could happen this weekend just checked all shoes near the entrance door for fear spiders may be in them now i know this is going to be come something i do religiously help husband needed a slow day and thats what he got i had to take my daughter to work because he was napping so hard he wouldnt wake up thankfully talking to my daughter kept me steady but it got bad after i came home extra vistaril and laying down for a while standing in airport about to have a panic attack took two clonazepam already looks like well be going for a third jennifer 1967 classes for next term are paid for books are bought monthly donation to church sent making dinner in a few minutes somehow im jittery it may have been from going to the college even though my husband was with me really anxious today had been doing well for 3 weeks hope im not spiraling down maybe between my daughter being gone and my friend dying so suddenly i should expect to have a couple of down anxious days so many people are struggling sending big hugs hello this im sorry im not really able to offer anything substantive with regard to this perhaps this is all due to the effects having smoked marijuana  then stopped but i dont really know i do believe however that depression  anxiety can cause a loss of the ability to feel emotions too at least over the long term im an older person now  ive been struggling with both for a lifetime and i certainly have experienced something of this myself hopefully other members here on pc will have some better insights they can offer i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting i would recommend seeing a doctor  therapist and see what they think i use cbd oil and it does have a nice calming effect to it it takes the edge off anxiety however i use cannabis in addition to my psych meds because for me cannabis alone isnt enough i dont know about your particular autoimmune disease i do know a friend who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease when she complained to her doctor about developing psych problems he told her it was apart of the disease once she got solid on her new diet  meds it resolved sorry to hear you are having such problems yes what you are going through is very common and expected for someone who quit consuming marijuana and who has anxiety and depression withdrawal from marijuana can last up to three months and the first month can be the most intense but then it gets much better and depression and anxiety makes you numb and you do not recognize your emotions and feelings it is like a defense or something i hope you are feeling better please reach out if you want to talk more so im at a college camp thing right now and there are two dances during the stay one was yesterday and one is tomorrow they require you to attend them i already tried to get out of it and they check the bathrooms so i cant hide out in there like i usually do the dance yesterday was an absolute disaster i felt my anxiety flare up as soon as i walked in the courtyard where there were hundreds of people in a huge crowd i had an anxiety attack but managed to hide it and i ended up sitting on the side for the 2 12 hours it lasted a little flaming ball of anxiety the next dance is tomorrow and i really need some advice i honestly have no idea what to do so anything is appreciated thank you all for reading quiet day today need one after all the errands so far this week the muscle relaxer seems to work okay but had to drop vistaril so i dont end up too groggy maybe thats why im a little squirmy today dinner is cooling in the fridge so well all be eating soon hugs to those that need them so i have been dealing with social anxiety for as long as i can remember though i didnt know thats what it was at first i only have one friend and she isnt in any of my classes which makes school really hard im 17 i can barely get words out when i talk to people and i always get really flushed so anyways i am set to be valedictorian of my high school class next year and i will have to give two speeches in front of thousands and thousands of people i cant do it when i was in eighth grade we had a graduation it was a k8 school and i had to give a speech i had a panic attack right before the graduation and i started crying in front of hundreds not even thousands of people and could barely finish my speech because i started to black out i cant do this again and i dont know what to do sorry to take up your time but i really need help does anyone know what i should do hello alyhart well its been many years since i was in school and i was a long way away from valedictorian congratulations on that by the way but it seems to me you just have to tell them this is simply not something you feel capable of doing they cant force you to do it i dont believe perhaps they can find some local celebrity type person to give a rousing graduation speech in your place ive had too many experiences over the years forcing myself to do things i didnt feel capable of doing because of my own social anxiety  ending up feeling thoroughly embarrassed  foolish because it actually did turn out just as badly as i had feared it would its not worth it in my estimation but you have to be strong  not let others cajole you into doing it telling you how it will all be okay nil carborundum illegitimi of course im assuming here you really dont want to do this perhaps theres a part of you that would really like to do it in that case perhaps theres a medication you could take that would allow you to give your speeches without unravelling you could perhaps approach your family doctor about that and beyond that again if this is something you really would like to do my suggestion would be prepare your speeches well ahead of time  practice practice practice my experience was that the few times i did have to give speeches when i knew my material backwardsforwards as the saying goes it all went much better for me good luck is there a counselor at school you could talk to or a teacher you trust to let them know how you feel about this and the distress its causing if you can get someone to understand your situation maybe they can help to find a solution that works for you and when i say talk to that could also be writing it down and handing it to the person i just wanted to support you and offer best wishes in whatever you decide to do what helps you with anxiety that doesnt involve medication i have medication and an appointment w a therapist but it is two weeks away i cant pinpoint a specific moment but i think its from a combination of socially awkward and embarrassing humiliating moments from childhood and my reserved nature i remember just shutting down completely when i felt embarassed id ignore the person or distract myself with something else actually thats still a coping method that i use today haha but hmm id say the anxiety peaked for me as a high school student i was terrified of giving class presentations i remember hyperventilating and rushing to the bathroom to puke before it was my turn then lo and behold i had a psychotic depressive episode and ive been terrified of crowded places since im mentioning that bc i think it all plays into each other the social anxiety depression and psychosis tldr social expectations of a high school student and a psychotic episode im one of those people that likes to read stories of people and their illnesses but also coping strategies etc do you know any books about social anxiety that have helped you one book i liked was called a life less anxiousby steve pavilanis having significant anxiety today but i think i know why ive had to take some valium to calm down and im still having a hard time anxiety is horrible id almost rather deal with depression then anxiety sending big hugs nike007 lots of tears and panic attacks still going on having insight into why its happening isnt helping at all have taken the prescribed dosage of valium not even close to touching it guiness187055 now rattled after making dinner i was doing so many things at once juggling things spikes my anxiety pretty bad plus i had to improvise a bit good thing i dont work in a restaurant daughters friend is still depressed she is getting burned out on him i told her she needs to take of herself first and if he does anything its not her fault going to watch a show or two and try to relax i have been dealing with anxiety today i took a warm bath and listened to music it helped some i found a list of coping skills and plan on trying a few ugh so sick of waking up with an anxiety attack it happens most mornings dreadful at least its s not a panic attack i guess just a large helping of heart pounding and body sweating  mind running anxiety expecting another call from my bank tomorrow i havent been able to fully pay on my credit card so im pretty sure thats what the call is about they called once friday but i missed it really anxious to have to deal with this hopefully i get a decent person on the phone so i can try to work something out instead of lying out of fear trying to keep calm i took more meds than i needed to this morning so spent most of the day groggy and lethargic ended up missing church couldnt focus on my tasks on the computer i hate doing that not being able to remember much very well just waiting until it gets out of my system anxiety has taken complete control of me already this morning im dying everything is crashing down on me and i just cant make it i feel like im bordering on a major fight with my boyfriend which may be relationship ending i should post separately about this so i dont hijack this thread please help didnt take the extra med today had therapy this morning talked about anxiety with going to school this next term honestly i already took the one class i wanted to take but i want to finish with a nokidding degree looked through my textbooks and they seem pretty straightforward will know more for sure next week when classes start see nurse tomorrow show her my lab work so hopefully she will leave me with latuda and not put me on something that will make things worse physically without the extra vistaril im not as calm but taking it now gives me a heavy dry mouth and lethargy hopefully with the pain management appointment on the 25th i wont need to be taking it anymore i plan a day at home to catch up on paperwork from being so far behind all summer and people call off i feel like i cant take a day off or everything goes to pot i know i need to have faith that other staff can handle it but right now i feel anxious and nauseous over today i found a post about the anxiety coach im looking at that site hi i am new to the forum i have increasingly felt like i want to stop talking as a bit of background i was the sensitive child  apparently in a family of very assertive and talkative people i can say now that they are quite domineering though i am an adult they still enjoy and feel entitled to offer their opinion about everything including my life choices even though i have children of my own now as a child i had a stammer which was quite severe at certain times and in certain situations i had speech therapy but it didnt resolve the problem i think i was reacting maybe to my childhood family situation which was difficult thankfully i always had good friends i also achieved ok academically and i worked in jobs which i enjoyed and which involved helping and working closely with vulnerable people i think my empathy kind of made up for my shyness and helped break barriers and i built good relationships with people it was like i hadnt had a voice in my family but at work i was valued i had a particularly nasty romantic relationship and when i went abroad to escape it i fell hook line and sinker for a charmer who became my husband he was abusive in every way but like many abusers abused me so cleverly that i didnt realise i was being abused until many years into the marriage i see now that he ride to keep me lacking in confidence sabotaging my development he was a loud person and had a booming voice loved to be centre of attention he wouldnt discuss things if we had any difference in views he would punish me if i tried to he used to tell me that he wishes i was nonverbal in my marriage my stammer returned to the severity that it had been when i was a child long story short i divorced him after becoming so unwell with his treatment of me i was so relieved to be able to tell people what i had been though i talked and talked it was like releasing everything i was free to talk no more secrecy i was diagnosed with ptsd and have been fighting that but something that has developed is my hatred of talking its not about stammering  my stammer is virtually gone now that he has its about a whole hatred of talking of talking myself or hearing other voices i wish i could go and live on a silent community where i never had to talk ever again or listen to other voices the feeling is getting stronger i dont know if social anxiety lies at the root of this i dont see myself as shy nowadays but maybe the ptsd is a cause also my ex tuned out to be such a liar telling dreadful lies about me in court and i have realised how he may be chatty and outgoing but every word he says is manipulative he uses people so now i feel repelled by loud people people who are witty and talkative  i had being around them and listening they just remind me of my ex trigger me and seem fake to me i am really worried that i will end up a total recluse i have two children and put on such a fake act in front of them sheltering them from the truth of my current issues hello miss sensitive thanks for sharing your concerns im afraid i cant really be of much help with it i also talk as little as possible  prefer to avoid conversation much to my wifes consternation and in addition im pretty reclusive as well however since im an older person its not a problem for me its just the way i am i see this is your first post here on pc so to psychcentral from the skeezyks may the time you spend here be of benefit psychcentral is a great place to get information as well as support for mental health issues the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are social groups you can join  chat rooms where

therapist something but im nervous shell hate me even though she probably wont maybe the problem is more i hate myself for it i dont know im crazy my college class starts in one week a bit nervous i was able to find a class that is one hour once a week im just going to take my clonazepam well im definitely not depressed my daughter moved the rest of her stuff yesterday to her dorm her room is so empty ive been having horrible panic and anxiety attacks and wonder how im going to pull this off im keeping busy but i just feel sick i think this is particularly hard because were so close and because shes the only one who has seen the good bad and ugly of my illness and has always gotten it shes always been of the mindset that her mom is ill and sometimes we do things a bit differently and that is ok we have been each others support which some may disagree with but it worked for us whenever either of us was having a tough time just holding hands and saying everything will be fine would calm us right down she was going to stay and go to college here but i knew she needed to fly so i helped her with the bigger college 2 hours away that was the most loving thing i could do for her thanks for letting me rattle on i feel better now or that could be the valium sending big hugs got through pnurse appt today she has nervous and so was i at least i dont have to change meds for another three months so thats good she was also okay with me going off vistaril because of the muscle relaxer hopefully ill be off the latter soon because it slows me down too much other than that and getting some extra groceries it was a peaceful day i did pretty good today got my car steam cleaned inside and out went to 3 bible studies floated in the pool had lunch and dinner with friends and after having done my daily calm meditation im going to watch rhony i think i might survive after all busy day tomorrow planned as well hugs to everyone its been weird today since i didnt have a good dream and went to a new store it was hot outside and i felt irritated but yesterday i was okay and went to class i think its my hormones i love how anxiety makes me feel stupid sarcasm i got a call about a job i applied for today but im absolutely terrified to call them back tomorrow the job is halfway across the country but where we really want to move to its just figuring out the logistics now that has me petrified i dont know how we afford to get out there for an interview much less afford a place to live and moving fees if i get the job i didnt think id be so scared to finally make this move been another quiet day daughter is home so i didnt much done anxiety is still there i just keep distracting myself for a while saw my counselor today and it was a rough session i wish my brain had an off switch did okay today now prepared for school next week good thing because im going to be busy starting tomorrow doing laundry and housework and making potato salad for church picnic on sunday anxiety is around the corner but i hope it doesnt jump me work seems to be my only salvation justafriend306 your refusal to lower yourself to another persons level in the middle of unnecessary conflict does not make you look weak it makes you look like the more mature wiser stronger person if you chose to respond in a like manner the conflict could escalate to something unmanageable theres nothing wrong with walking away i admire that best wishes well i will start off by saying i am a 38 year old female who lives by myself along with 2 dogs and 1 cat i have been living alone for 5 years now and have found my anxiety getting worse each year i used to be a very outgoing friendly happy person and now i am so insecure filled with worry and guilt and am so nervous to be around people because of what they may think of me and my life i literally have 1 girlfriend and i have known her for 24 years unfortunately over the years i have distanced myself from her because i feel i cant relate to her anymore she is married and has children i am divorced with no children i think in a way i distanced myself because i am jealous of her life ive always wanted a family and a home i currently have a boyfriend of 2 years now however the situation isnt really ideal for anyone he is currently married but they live in same house different rooms they are coparenting for the children while i love him to death i dont know if i am with him because i love him because i am lonely because i really want to be with someone because i like to punish myself or because i am just that messed up and think its what i deserve i have really had some abusive relationships in my life its seems to be what i attract he is not abusive at all he treats me very well but i want him to move out and finalize a divorce and we argue about it often this relationship goes along with this anxiety because truthfully i am a secret no one gets to know me in his family i currently work in a very customer service job i am a pit boss at a casino this job forces me to talk to people sometimes have uncomfortable conversations with them i supervise people and i am very outgoing however everyone thinks i am always angry because of the look on my face i dont smile when i am not talking to people aka resting bi face the truth is i am just nervous i dont want people to judge me im over weight and do not like how i look or feel about myself and i feel everyone else thinks just like i do the funny thing is once my shift gets going i forget all about the anxiety i dont know if its the business that takes the thoughts away from it or what but when the night slows down it all comes rushing back i find myself sitting alone in our employee dining room even though there are 50 people in there at most times i feel like i dont know how to converse with people and sometimes i feel like  are these people really that stupid thinking like that is really bad i dont feel i am smarter than people but i feel like i have way more common sense than some and unfortunately i feel like i talk to people like they are stupid and that is not my intention at all i try to talk so they come up with the right answer on their own while being guided and realizing just how little effort it takes to think a few more minutes and come up with the answer on their own but it comes out all wrong the anxiety then takes over my whole being and i just want to run far away sometimes i feel like im not myself when im at work like i get to be someone else the guests there dont know my personal life they dont know what ive been through so they just get to see happy me this anxiety isnt just work and friend related it is at its worst when attending family functions i really do not associate with family i cant breathe when i am around them i have been in my apartment for 5 years and i have never had them over i have 2 sisters and a father that live 1520 min from me and they have never seen my place i dont know what it is that freaks me out or triggers it i just wish it would go away and i could have my life back its pretty lonely being 38 and having no friends any suggestions jennifer 1967 well im an older person not twice your age yet but im gettin there im married but otherwise i lead a thoroughly solitary lifestyle by choice there is no extended family  i have no friends or acquaintances i only leave the house when necessary it works for me however even though i live the reclusive lifestyle i live voluntarily i find that the more i am alone the more i prefer to just be alone the more alone the better and the less comfortable it is for me to be outabout being alone  feeling awkward in social situations breeds on itself i believe yes when youre at work  busy it makes sense to me that your social anxiety would fade into the background but then as soon as youre off work or not busy doing what you do it comes rushing back from my perspective i think the remedy for this is simply to get out there  find ways to be more social volunteer pursue some personal interests that put you in touch with other people that sort of thing i dont know what kinds of things are of interest to you so its difficult to be specific but the more you get out there the easier it will become perhaps still not easy but easier however if you feel this is something you simply cant do on your own then the alternatives are mental health therapy   or psych meds unfortunately there arent any magic solutions to this that i know of perhaps other members will have other suggestions to offer i wish you well church picnic went well over half of the potato salad was eaten so that was good i was nervous with my husband being out in the heat but he took it very well on the other hand i started to become a hot sweaty mess so we left early school starts tomorrow i hope that whatever i have for homework will be done before thursday my husband is taking me out that day for a spa treatment friday is when i get another injection for my backi may be knocked out for it saturday is my birthday been really anxious but i think ill still do okay hope school goes well fharriage this is the first time its back to school and im not going as i finished it feels kind of weird anxiety was mostly okay most of the day minus a very short panic attack its almost time for bed i have to take the dog out but its really dark so i get kind of scared im kind of nervous to sleep too i know it sounds juvenile but im kind of worried bad people are in my closet i havent felt this way in years until recently i saw something creepy on tv not too long ago i think this triggered it i hope it goes away soon im sort of nervous because my college class starts on tuesday but its only one hour a relative is going to take me so i hope it goes well im feeling monday work anxiety i feel extra anxious almost every monday but it doesnt make it any easier so anxious about my literature class the whole thing is based on the final project which is an anthology of works that we like and why we like them lots of words and it starts with the introductory assignment ugh nothing like feeling under pressure already at least my office app class started slow the saving grace is that it isnt due until sunday why do i do this to myself so anxious about money today it helps being woke by a call from someone who you owe money to sarcasm i really want to do credit counseling to figure this all out but the only place around is associated with the company i work for so im feeling too freaked out to try to make an appointment i dont know what to do 88butterfly88 finished the literature assignment but not very well going to read ahead and see if i can do better still have to plan meals for the next few days and get groceries i just want to get to thursday so i can relax and enjoy things sassandclass i am on clozapine at night and it depresses me but also makes me sleep through the night that is why i take it at bedtime i need it for my schitzophrenia which makes nervous alot but for some reason today i feel pretty good psychnitrous im just wondering who here is taking meds for their anxiety and who is getting therapy and which you think works better ive been having a lot of anxiety with starting a new job lately and my pdoc offered me an ssri i told her id get therapy instead but its been 2 months and i still havent called for an appointment if meds which meds and if therapy do you know the type thanks for your help im on meds for depression welbutrin paxil lamictal and none seem to help with anxiety even though paxil is supposed to also been in therapy cognitive approach for a couple months and that is helping a bit but its really difficult to change thinking patterns ive had for 20 years im holding out hope that therapy will work pdoc hasnt offered anything for anxiety but i think its going to take some time sometimes psychotic dont lose sight of the fact that new jobsactivities cause everyone anxiety to a certain extent but will probably lessen over time as you get to know the routines and have a bit more confidence in your ability to do the job i use to get horrible stiff necks for the first couple weeks of a new job try that doing a new job in really bad pain  but i look down the road to six weeks or months and just concentrate on doing the best i can until then im on a low dose of cipralex it helps but doesnt eliminate all of my anxiety i can function a lot better and do things i couldnt before such as eating out i recently asked my psychiatrist for some psychotherapy that specifically addresses my anxiety since i have noticed my thinking patterns tend to nourish it the medication hasnt eased this problem it has helped ease the obsessive nature of anxiety though we are going to discuss this at my next appointment i have a feeling therapy and medication will probably help me a lot more than just one or the other doing a little better today renewed my lunesta and planned meals for the week now to figure out when to get groceries the rest of the week is filled with appointments and birthday stuff so yesterday i went to my college class and i was nervous during class i dont know if it was the heat or looking for the right building that i was tired i wish i could have done better im coming down off a pretty  high several hour long panic whew she is safe my daughter is safe that is what is important i was on the phone with my daughter when her fire alarm went off while talking to me there was a knock at her door telling her to get out of the building smoke was billowing from the top floor so as you can imagine my heart was in my throat the latest update is that it is all out she suspects it was a dryer fire she is waiting for permission to go back inside she is pretty sure her condo is okay its opposite side of the building on the ground floor but who cares about a bit of damage she is okay justafriend306 yzen hi there i am ok but still have burning sensation in my shoulders and behind my neck what was a great day at the spa turned into yet even more pain when i dropped something in the car and tried to reach it my left shoulder is strained now tomorrow i have undergo another nerve block in my back nervous and not feeling good now adult coloring really helps me calm down with the anxiety lavender essential oil does best for me i cant stop feeling that everyone hates me i know its not true but the thought wont go away one person is mad at me at work and now i dread going back because im afraid everyone will take his side and hate me and it will be miserable and now i cant sleep and i didnt know where to turn and i have no one to talk to so i came here if you dont have a therapist i recommend getting onesometimes having someone in authority tell you that other people dont hate you stops this in its tracks yesterday i found out that the nerve block they put in my back was a trial run i had no pain for about 30 minutes then it hurt like hell until i took the muscle relaxer today was my birthday and im feeling better we went out of town for the day i got a new purse a crystal necklace and a set of headphones we also ate a ton of food looks like ill be cooking the rest of this month and next month but it was good i withdrew from my literature class im too stressed out to handle two hard classes ill take it again another term i want this to be accomplished but not losing my sanity doing it slow and easy anxiety will go down once the withdrawal is processed hope i can handle that havent posted on here in awhile when my doctor put me on abilify for my depression it drastically decreased the anxiety as well thank the good lord i hope it continues 88butterfly88 was busy cleaning house yesterday while the kids were gone we got quite a bit done but we were worn out today was t and labs for the regular doc appt next week t went okay i talked a bit about the anxiety from the two classes so that helped finished my homework for the week a 70 question pretest to be done in 70 minutes needless to say i didnt finish and i didnt do well still i remembered a lot so that was good tomorrow is dermatology my face is back to where it once was which is itchy and red ill see what she does this time anxiety is doing better now but i wish i wasnt so bad with the extra class it has been a good day im having rooms remodeled my daughter is back in school i am writing again no complaints saw dermatologist today she has no more options for me so shes referring me to her boss she also gave me two more ointments and a strong antibiotic im not sure about the latter as it has some nasty side effects otherwise a quiet day anxiety is down a little but depression is starting to creep in had a panic attack at my endocrinologists office today i was shaking and they wanted to weigh me while i was shaking so i asked them to wait a minute and then the shaking stopped and i got weighed went to the appointment the appointment was fine mentioned i had lightheartedness which i thought was from low blood sugar but the doctor seems to think instead its low blood pressure from the inderal i take for anxiety ugh i cant catch a break we went to a pair this morning and took photos ive been using the corticosteroid cream even for a tiny amount twice a day ive been really irritable however my skin is doing better didnt have much else going on until next week i may have to redo my laptop since its now acting weird anxiety is high because of the irritability not posted for a while im 28 weeks pregnant today the reality that this baby has gotta come out is hitting hard anxiety coming and going about all sorts nervous about upcoming obstetrician appointment i get pain when examined so keep crying about it went mad on cleaning and tidying house today nesting instinct money worries and hubby gotta get a new job stepdaughter starting new school hope shes ok gotta finish my masters degree dissertation before baby arrives im soooo tired and stressed scaredhaving so much pain im having some pretty intense anxiety today dealing with a few triggers have a ton to do but i feel completely unable to do them at the moment that in itself is making me even more anxious too i havent really posted in the anxiety forums since i signed up ive been dealing more with depression in the last few months but my catastrophic thinking is back in full force today ive written to check in with a few friends and ended up deleting my message because i realized my tone sounded like i was telling them goodbye i have that mydaysarenumbered kind of certainty stillive been here a million times before and i logically know i just need to wait it out and it will pass and my brain will flip back to the lesser of my two evils depression fun times anxiety is even worse now since a relative messaged me the relative wants to know what ive done to make no one at the nursing home say happy birthday same as my mother who asked what i did to the bullies at school to make them pick on me right now i hate them i hate them both i have been coming a long way from what i used to be i have battled anxiety pretty much all my life until a few years ago when i did spiritual forgiveness and forgave some people and connected with god a lot better i also finally have the right prescription glasses and not afraid of the dark anymore either my anxiety has pretty much gone down the drain for a good reason great for you stress anxiety and depression have landed me in the hospital in days past and i still deal with depression but dealing with things causing the anxiety has helped a bit even with that swhiddon leejosepho good for you i hope i can get there too i have struggled with anxiety and depression off and on all my life the recent episode the most severe now i really need to make some lifestyle changes and do the work i should be doing so it never gets this bad again have a bad sinus infection the past couple of days pain is relentless and nsaids are not helping even in large doses finished homework for this week should start getting harder by next week days have been going slowly otherwise so thats good not as anxious but still kinda of down i was sort of anxious this afternoon i realized i took my geodon late geodon is not for anxiety but when i realized i didnt take it i started worrying about that i feel okay now that ive taken it my anxiety has been under control today thankfully i have this weird nervousness though like i just want to talk someones ear off about nothing really im a pretty quiet private person but i get these jittery moods where i get chatty overly verbose and feel like im going to explode if i dont call or email someone and talk their ear off my mom for all her faults is good at absorbing my wordy outbursts when i call her i need to remember that and be grateful quotealpacalicious5409010when i think about my therapist i feel anxious i miss her i didnt see her this week maybe thats why also since this is a therapy service offered by my university when ill finish uni and that is soon on february ill have to stop seeing her i think so this hurt me a bit because i think ill miss her even more i wish i could stay more plus i feel the same problems are with me everyday i need therapyquote im actually afraid to start therapy because i would view the therapist like a best friend and would miss that person well husband has an allergy to two types of dust mites this means more cleaning that ill have to do im getting shots for my right rotator cuff in a couple of weeks hopefully ill be out of pain i have arthritis in my shoulder so well see diabetes stuff has been renewed need to make a regular doc appt in december before she goes on maternity leave also have to make appt for mammogram which i forgot to do this summer things are going somewhat okay i worry about daughters boyfriends parents who are vacationing in fl hope they get out before the hurricane arrives they already had enough drama due to the older brother mood is still kind of down this type of anxiety is manageable i have a mountain of commitments and errands today much more than normal and it makes me feel unable to take enjoyment in little things but i can handle this level of stress its not a deal breaker i may not enjoy today but i wont necessarily hate it either i can work with this at least only had to plan meals and get some groceries for those meals otherwise ive been resting i also have the tires ordered sent a message to get a quote from the electrician and put a voicemail in for the mammogram have to get meds tomorrow that may take awhile anxiety is down but my mood is also down hope it perks up in a while i was taking caffeine pills for energy and my therapist asked me to stop made a big difference in my anxiety no heart palpitations or stomach churning between that and the new medication for depression im on my anxiety and panic is in check hallelujah i have a harder time with anxiety then depression hope this continues thank you for creating this thread it was very helpful going through all of the replies so this past month ive had three incidents that would normally cause me a huge amount of anxiety some of which would have normally left me anxious for hours or a day or two but i didnt i just dealt with it the best way i could at the time and that was that looking back im proud of how i was able to keep cool the other day i decided to sever contact with two acquaintances on facebook and this caused me the biggest burst of anxiety that ive felt in the past month or so but while it was significant it only lasted five minutes and i was able to keep my cool there too i know that im not going to be completely free of anxiety its a normal part of me and always will be ill no doubt have some anxiety in the future but so far it seems like ive learned how to get control of it and keep it in check  im really happy for you being able to control your anxiety is such an awesome feeling especially for me its been really difficult last week for me where i would just consistently feel anxious and let that dictate my actions and my lifestyle i nearly ruined my relationship with two people i really care and love this week has been much better and i have been able to work through my negative thoughts and emotions and in the long run control my anxiety it feels very accomplishing its hard to keep up sometimes because i feel like i am going to ruin it but i just keep going and improving its a practice and lifestyle and im glad that people are working through it slowly but surely did a load of laundry appointments for electrician and mammogram are set renewed my latuda prescription so i can order it next week i have been so grumpy this week yesterday was really bad i chewed out an old lady that i thought was cutting in front of me im normally not that combative still worried about my daughters boyfriends parents who were vacationing in florida mowers and trimmers are outside my home office the noise has me clenching my teeth like swarms of mechanical wasps so yeah my anxiety is up along with being irritable anonymous50013 i had a short panic attack today otherwise anxiety was okay lots of crazy thoughts in my head today though realizer 88butterfly88 sorry to hear about your panic attack ive had some anxiety today kind of the feeling where id like to curl up in a locked up room in a bean bag and pillows and feel safe but dont feel like i could feel safe ive come a huge way from how bad my anxiety used to be but it is still unpleasant im having anxiety about eating certain things in recovery from an ed and about being alone vs being with my family who are not the healthiest people to be around for extended periods of time finished homework for next week it was like i was in a fog and when i came out i felt jittery made a hefty meal for dinner and now im starting to calm down i have church tomorrow and t on monday i may talk to t and see what i can do to get rid of this irritability cant sleep worrying about dissertation want to get it done before babys here worried i wont cope with everything including looking after step daughter im low in iron and so tired and achy a bit anxious due to the hurricane because it is raining and probably the power would go out i was able to finish my homework for both classes i can spend days feeling certain that the worst case scenarios will come true then mercifully it just stops suddenly the future isnt as scary it feels like a physical switch being thrown almost instantaneous i dont get it asmr videos get me so drowsy sometimes i fall asleep when i listen to one i like to listen to music play my favourite game have a nap in the top of the ptsd forum there are grounding techniques that may help you take a look  right at the top on agoraphobia i found it online and the lady who runs it lyn seems reasonable she does 3 weeks of what she calls talking about it why am i agoraphobic why am i anxious what are my thoughts when these ssituations happen to me and then 3 weeks of exposure to the anxiety im really hoping it helps me at least a little im doing this for myself so i hope the 45 i payed for it was worth it i start on the 22nd september we are going to do some muscle relaxing stuff shattered thats wonderful i suffer from agoraphobia too would you mind pming me the link i really struggle and meds and therapy havent been effective its been years since i went out regularly i live five minutes from the mall last time there was over four years ago i get to pdoc and t appts and thats about it my bf picks up my meds grocery shops etc i cant even go to my bipolar support group meetings anymoreand i used to be a facilitator i want my life back im super excited for you shattered sanity todays meant to be the day i have my first session really dont want to do it not because im anxious im just drained need too though for my own good so the first session was just talking about anxiety what causes it and what i do to help with it we identified what my goal would be go to mcdonalds and she also told me about this cd she wants me to order that will teach me about the difference between relaxation and tention continues next week mostly good though she did cut it short i payed for a 60 minit session and only got 30 bjornen  i get that too at times ill feel dread of some impending disaster and sometimes my mood will flip and everything will feel full of peace and almost euphoria its kind of frustrating sending thoughts to everyone in hurricane danger areas x im still getting anxiety around eating today i need to remind myself that where food my body and exercise is concerned my brain just doesnt function i need to go by the rules or guidance of other people like my dietician and not follow my ed thoughts im starting dogwalking this week for two different people and feel kind of anxious about that doing new things makes me extremely anxious even if its something i am sure i will enjoy just the fact that it is new or in a new environment makes it feel like going to a dentist to have teeth extracted ended up in urgent care for pain in my right eye doc didnt know if it was pinkeye or a stye she gave me antibiotic cream regardless it isnt helping me much so i may have to go to an eye doctor tomorrow i missed church again but i felt this was more important husband is stuck with more homework than planned so its been a quiet day anxiety is up but manageable at the moment hope your eye feels better fharraige my anxiety is still really up at the moment a lot of it related to people and relationshipsinteractions i think at times im feeling paralysed by anxiety and just want to crawl out of my skin im in recovery from a variety of addictionsprocess addictions and the only relationship i really feel good in is my one with my sponsor but i really start feeling bad when i just talk to him constantly and offload all my feelings on one person anxiety is steadily increasing there is nothing in my life that i dont feel nervous about theres nothing i can think of to help it my anxiety has been extremely high today to the point of feeling like i cant leave the house i made myself get out anyway which was good but i dont know whats happened that its shot up recently had a job interview today that sent my anxiety skyhigh i dont know what it is about interviewing with this place i just feel like a mess during them at least its over now i should be able to relax hello today i had an interesting feeling for the first time i felt in control of my anxiety i could hear the worry thoughts but i didnt want to run from them like i used to i could hear my negative thoughts in my mind but i was able to coexist with them and not let them push me around its almost like i was standing up to a bully it felt great and i hope i can keep this up sometimes its the little things in life congratulations thats a huge step forward litw thats great keep up the good work congrats rubycube hello i am new here i have been reading threads online about anxiety for a while and decided to join because they seemed so useful i am happy for you worrist and happy to possibly meet all of you guys so happy for you keep up the positive thinking i am new here and so its nice to meet everyone i hope to benefit from these forums and hopefully benefit someone else as well yes for me too it is like standing up to a bully congratulations on your success yay thats amazing its really hard to practice controlling anxiety after letting it control you for so long ive built it up to a lifestyle where i do things i enjoy and things i know will help me calm down in order to keep my anxiety in check its a struggle and sometimes i do lose to it but i dont stop keep going im going to cook for friends tonight nothing fancy i hate using the excuse that i will do something when i get better why not now so what if i feel tense and anxious i like making food and i shouldnt wait around for some mythical perfect day to do it edit it turned out alright weirdly i still had the tension from a random anxiety today but it didnt affect my mood tonight like it normally would my body just feels like it ran a marathon is all i gave notice i am moving effective 31 oct  yet i dont have new place yet i am really quite anxious about this jennifer 1967 im back at least for a bit temporary back injections worked out okay but i have a bad backache for a day or two after they wear off i will be seeing the pain management doc tomorrow to see if i get the longlasting ones i hope so because i like to do more around the house my mind is creating worsecase scenarios as usual so im still rather anxious about the whole thing school is going okay not sure if i want to continue taking classes as they stress me out more than anything now husband is doing better now that we had the carpets cleaned it will be time though to vacuum everything and im not looking forward to that so right now im nervous but i seem to manage it okay im feeling really anxious about work tomorrow im really not invested in this job anymore i just dont want to bother going i do best when i can convince myself that there is nothing to gain by obsessing on the future the nagging voice inside is trying to convince me that im being irresponsible by not thinking about the future enough but my appointments are made and my calendar is marked for any important events so theres literally no reason to think anymore about the future anything else is just rumination im doing an okay job at not giving in to that voice this morning i hope you all are managing okay too since losing my dad on april 20th i havent been back to my job well i tried one morning around two weeks ago but i had severe panic attacks couldnt focus on my work kept crying had endless intrusive thoughts etc so i only worked 3 hours today was my first actual day back since it happened and i felt pretty okay not 100 of course but much better than the first time i tried to go back today was a pretty nice day all in all just thought i would share well done thats a huge thing that you have done its hard enough to go back to work after a long period of time off ill but to have loss added in to the mix makes it even harder for you you did really well xxx still have back pain but its dull the longterm injection for the left side is oct 5 still having the catastrophic thinking but plan out positive outcomes seems to help ran errands and doing laundry now would study but i need a few hours uninterrupted and it didnt happen today hopefully tomorrow afternoon will be better after all the hospital appointments in the morning still hanging in there though thankfully my anxiety is feeling great today which i think is a good thing music always seems to help me relax and put my mind at ease anytime im stressed out or have too much on my mind getting a little stressed and anxious about things i know i need to do but keep putting off i can be a procrastinator hugs to everyone grouphug i took a lot of xanax and some inderal today because i was agitated i wasnt as nervous as usual probably because of the meds i wish i could get by with less meds today my anxiety has not been too bad its 853pm and i usually get really bad anxiety at night i had plenty of rest today 88butterfly88 my anxiety is building again it doesnt help that possible trigger my period started last night function rejtgomb tag

thisinnertext   gombvalue  show    so my moods are all over the place im starting to worry about a job interview i have on friday i really hope that it goes well i still really need a fulltime job and ive been seeing fewer and fewer fulltime positions being posted online i know a new job is going to take care of so much stress i just have to get one my stress is bleeding over to my boyfriend now and hes starting to have little depressive episodes too i dont know how much more of this i can take i really want it to start getting better soon dreading tomorrow too many people i dont want to meet with too many appointments i dont want to keep from morning all the way into the evening too much tired of pretending for them dreaming of running away forever but no jennifer 1967 ggggaaaahhhhh having a panic attack over something ive done many times before trying to talkcalm my way out of it anonymous50013 fuzzybear i really want to cancel tomorrow i mean on 1 hand 45 is a lot of money to waste and if i dont aqctually do the first session whats the point but then my emotions have been all over the place this week and ive felt drained on a number f occasions im sure lynn would understand having anxiety about going to the gym but id better go now or ill lose my little workout today had a major panic attack at the pharmacy it came out of no where for no reason thank god for xanax i usually get anxious when im idle so the only thing that really helps me with anxiety is distracting myself with information watching videos listening to music or reading up on something nonstop is what i usually do to cope i like theatre and was always curious about the actual process involved in making a play and performing it but my social anxiety always prevented me from trying to get involved in amateur stuff well last summer i had the luckiest moment in my entire life and ended up not only meeting my favorite actor but actually spending some time at his home with his wife who is an amazing person involved in theatre herself anyway meeting those people seeing first hand how this favorite actor of mine is this rather introverted person who is quite uncomfortable being in the center of any attention and so on managed to give me a push and enough courage to take some amateur acting classes yesterday my class had the first performance of a play on an actual theatre stage with an audience i was so nervous and i did take half a xanax but i managed to go out there and say my lines and actually do ok i was afraid i would not be able to go on stage or that i would go and forget everything but it went well and that was one of the few victories i have had against my social anxiety actually i would recommend amateur acting classes to everyone they can help with social anxiety and with how you present yourself to others with trusting and being more vulnerable in front of other people plus if you do a play that requires camaraderie and trust so you may end up making friends wow to me this is much more than a small success i could never do that thats great i also recommend acting classes for anyone i love love love acting just got a call back from my drs office they want blood tests before my next appointment its usually easier for me to go the week before so that means tomorrow plus i have another blood test ive been putting off because of insurance for another dr that i should do that should be about 45 vials of blood altogether i have a severe phobia of needles usually i can get through it if they dont have to take much blood and can go through the back of my hand but with this much theyre going to insist on going through my arm and that always gives me a panic attack im already so anxious to go tomorrow im going to have to take an extra prn before i go otherwise im going to have a panic attack in the lab i just know it im going to take a few days break from pc hugs to all nothing like a 62 hour work week to shock you out of vacation mode today is meant to be the first day of my course the 6 week one i posted about i really dont want to do it really dont glad it is friday my anxiety at workhome this week has been terrible ive kept it mostly to myselfits been a tough one saturday should be better and calmer so the first session was just talking about anxiety what causes it and what i do to help with it we identified what my goal would be go to mcdonalds and she also told me about this cd she wants me to order that will teach me about the difference between relaxation and tention continues next week mostly good though she did cut it short i payed for a 60 minit session and only got 30 for the last two days i had no anxiety but today i did and it was getting bad i took a 05 ativan and had my youngest daughter sing some of her favorite songs to me she danced for me too we watched a few youtube videos and had a good laugh my anxiety went away today i knew my day would be busy i took a ativan before i left the house then hours and hours later i was ready to try and relax i could feel the anxiety sneaking in i took another ativan to help me settle down i played some music for a while 88butterfly88 i wasnt overly anxious today for a change last night i was a wreck though i had so much nervous energy i only got 5 hours sleep i tried to take xanax to help me sleep but it isnt making me as tired lately which is good for when i take it in the day but im hoping this doesnt mean it will stop working for my anxiety one of the things that has held me back professionally has been taking risks ive been scared to take risks for as long as i can remember i remember thinking what if this happens or what if that happens you know the routine late last year a guy from work left and i was asked if i wanted to take his duties over while we searched his replacement in the past every time ive been in this situation i would have said no this time i decided that things would be different i said yes i was scared and terrified but all my team members were very compassionate i learned so many things i improved my process that now im up for a promotion this was the first time that i really felt that i was beating my anxiety ive noticed myself starting to take more risks others may not see them as being big risks but for me they are huge and it feels fantastic go you thats how im handling the same issues at work asking for and taking on added responsibilities scary some days but moving me in the right direction  thanks for sharing i needed to hear that great job worrist those are actions to be proud of it gets difficult overcoming those mental barriers and the fact that you didnt let them stop you from advancing in your career thats just awesome and a great achievement wish you the best anxiety is not fear exactly because fear is focused on something right in front of you a real and objective danger it is instead a kind of fear gone wild a generalized sense of dread about something out there that seems menacing but that in truth is not menacing and may not even be out there if youre anxious you find it difficult to talk yourself out of this foreboding you become trapped in an endless loop of whatifs i was flesh bereft of spirit wrote the journalist patricia pearson in a brief history of anxiety yours and mine in a pitchperfect description of this emotional morass a friable self grotesque i got an aids test i had my moles checked i grew suspicious of pains in my back if i was nauseous i worried about cancer and started reading up obsessively on symptoms i lay in bed whenever i could trying to shut up the clamor of terror with sleep  robin marantz henig understanding the anxious mind i realized today that the last time i sat down to watch a tv show or film either at home or in a theater was november ive gone almost a whole year without allowing myself to escape for a little while something about getting involved in stories sets the worry wheels in motion for me i dont understand why its like getting lost in fiction makes me feel out of control of myself and starts a cascade of catastrophic thoughts i dont really miss any of it its just weird screw this i wish i could go back into toddler and kids when i still dumb and too ignorant to care with any problems tomorrow my mental health worker is coming well so she says shes very angry with me because i put in a complaint about her that she wasnt doing her job well she isnt i just hope she wont slap me thats my biggist fear about tomorrow that she will she wouldnt be allowed too but well i lived with abuse all my life so you can understand why i think that way very irritable today unusual for me dont know if its anxiety related or not wish it would just go away hugs to all those that are struggling i saw pdoc yesterday shes downing my antipsychotic and im a bit worried it wont go well but im trying to be hopeful im anxious about being put under tomorrow for a procedure ive been put under plenty of times but this one is bothering me for some reason 88butterfly88 im anxious again because the last paycheck did not go to well so i anxious if boss would be late again next i was expected to earn raise this time since i have been a permanent work but they postpone to talk about it with busy excuse through it is true that they are busy im not sure anymore hi all its a long story but ill say that though i took my driving license as soon as i was allowed to i have always been terrified of driving for several years i could just drive for very short times and on well known roads with someone sitting near me then i totally stopped at the end i even had anxiety when i tried to just sit on the driving seat well at a certain point for various reasons i began wanting to can drive though i was still terified i went back to driving school because after years without driving i really needed it then i began driving again with my parents and then aloneon the first time i drove for a very very short time and on a very easy road out of town and i had anxiety however it was around a year ago i still anxiety for many other times actually but then it became a bit less and i began feeling safe driving for longer times and also in town i took many little steps well now i can drive alone every day to the place where im having a sort of working experience out of my town and sometimes i went also to other places in the area even without practicing before just knowing some points in the area im not terrified at the idea not to can handle some unexpected situations i can do it last year i would have never ever imagined to can do so when i read about people who overcame driving anxiety i used to think i could never do itinstead maybe at the moment i would have a very very long drive like for going on holidaymaybe in future ill can maybe its a bit too much i dont know yetbut compared to last year this is a very big success so what i mean is overcoming driving anxiety is possible you can do it too you can feel free to message me also privately if you want to talk about driving anxiety im happy to help if i can my suggestion is little steps hugs to all sorry if there are any english mistakes congratulation  thanks for sharing your success congrats overcoming fears feels so good congratulations beaflower congratulations i have a bit of driving anxiety as well hence why i am 20 and have yet to get my license aha thank you for sharing thank you friends for celebrating with me i woke up didnt even have a chance to get out of bed and had a panic attack just laying there i got up and took my thyroid medication as usual and then unfortunately had to wait 30 minutes before i could take any other med i ended feeling better i just hate waking up that way i wondered if i had a nightmare but i dont recall one im not doing well been overwhelmed by other class so i withdrew now i dont have anything to do and feel frustrated by my anxiety i dont feel good about going out and about either my husband also has anxiety with class and i have to remind him that this is supposed to be for personal benefit but he puts too high of an expectation on himself maybe i do too i dont know my right shoulder is sore and my lower back hurts i think i may just have tendonitis in the shoulder since i have that before i have lidocaine patches but they take 23 weeks to help plus i forget to put them on mri is the middle of next month longterm treatment for the back is next week my brain has been running through catastrophic thinking for a while but i imagine good outcomes so it helps im just sad and upset right now im trying to do better but it seems the anxiety keeps winning out even with good meds and therapy im back to feeling useless and lazy i just dont know what to do now never did do the second part of my anxiety course probably not wise i spent a lot of money on that but the plus side is that the girl who instructs me didnt even call me to ask why i didnt bother with it i think deep down she knows from that first session it wasnt working and she knows she was wrong to rip me off yesterday i got handed eviction notice to leave my current property in 4 weeks i cant pay the price they are asking to keep me here so for the next few weeks i will be looking for somewhere close to where i currently am to make the move as stressfree as possible turtlerider having a panic attack broke out the valium anxiety sucks hugs to everyone that is struggling alicetailor pineapple010 i have driving riding in a car anxiety i am seeing a new cbt therapist progress i have made will get in the car and ride around town with some fear we live in a big city i dont like riding on the freeway ill drive around a radius of about five miles i wont drive at night i wont drive on the freeway today i drove to lunch and the grocery and back i also drove to my bipolar group and back with my husband in the car tomorrow i need to drive to yoga by myself ill keep hopping in this thread to post progress drove this morning to take the car down for a repair will likely have to go pick it up one goal i have this week is to drive around a tiny bit at night maybe just in the neighborhood and the out on the big streets a little drove yesterday to mcdonalds and then to a quilt store also drove home from bipolar support group today plan to drive to yoga drove back and forth to yoga alone went to yoga again today drove back and forth alone i want to drive some at night just sort of around the neighborhood but by the time it gets dark i am really tired disastrous couple of days developed terror of riding in cars exhausted i can relate to you i am 74 use to teach driving now when i am a passenger i have to sit in the back seat even that is no good i get vertigo and when i drive myself like you i do not do tunpikes nor do i drive at night im incredibly scared of driving and havent done so in 15 years that is within some months of obtaining my drivers license it is due to a nearaccident of which i cant remember a single thing not even that it happened but my parents were in the car with me and they agree on its happening ive given up by now i have too many other issues to address and this one is not bothering me too much at the moment of course it would be different if i had to go to work but luckily i work frome home im afraid of driving too and ashamed of it  i feel like i am not a real grownup even at 53 years old i do have a license and can drive if i absolutely have to but that is rare as long as it isnt dark raining and i dont have to take a highway or go anywhere unfamiliar i avoid if at all possible  it terrifies me bes22 oh dont worry i know  the stress is palpable and that makes things worse its a negative cycle today i feel the same and struggling with myselfi am really trying to keep bringing my mind back to the moment instead of letting it wander out to problems everybody here sounds just like me i have been fighting anxiety and depression for the past 5 years and still not sure if its all in my head or is a real physical condition in my brain everyone i know including my family say that its all in the way i think i grew up in a country where i was never expected to drive because we have lots of population and public transportation options but when i moved to usa i always tried to live 23 miles from work and took uber to work everyday but now i married the man of my dreams and its not totally up to me to pick where i live we cant keep buying houses close to work every time i change a job i must drive though it causes me lots of anxiety started taking klonopin for my anxiety attacks and fetzima 80mg for depression am driving on 30mph speed limit roads to work with my husband sitting by my side hope to be able to drive ti work by myself someday welcome to pc nimazen this thread is perfect for me i have a sort of driving phobia have had my licences for 6 years but till few months ago i practically didnt use it i was terrified but now im really improving i didnt think i could honestly my therapist is helping me what is working for me is to talk little little steps one at a time i began driving with someone and out of town but now i can drive for a short time alone out of town or with someone in town didnt try the two things together yet alone in town but step by step ill arrive to it dont give up you all i thought i couldnt do it but now im really doing it step by step and with some help we can learn how to drive my father is being faced with having his license revoked this has increased my own anxiety about driving as i now feel i am being monitored i dont think you are monitored how you drive doesnt reflect how your dad drives i dont mind driving but being a passenger causes me great anxiety i have to know exactly where we are going and when we are coming back if i dont drive and it has to be a distance i can walk or get a taxi back if needed i have made no progress if anything i am much worse about it if i rode to the store with someone and they veered on to a freeway to leave town i would have to take control of the vehicle if they wouldnt let me out or turn around i lost a job a few years ago due to the big boss of the company wanting me to accompany him as he drove randomly around the county looking at various properties thinking i could tough it out so he wouldnt know i said nothing till i blasted his truck interior with breakfast and got out when he stopped the truck and refused to get back in im sorry this puts so much stress on you and hope you feel better soon dowdythefifth if this tells you anything it took me 20 minutes of procrastinating before i could type into this box hello ive gone through the same social issues i currently have no friends outside my family because i feel really afraid to make some and i am in college not getting the full college experience well community college anyway i just wish i wasnt so afraid i know i can be a good friend and all but just taking that step to actually speaking to someone is where i struggle it might be that im a little critical of myself and afraid that those i approach might not find me interesting enough to want to actually develop a friendship with me because i can be a little different at times a mindset i believe my mental issues have contributed to but yes that is my social anxiety story oh i also am really uncomfortable going out to public places the whole i think im the center of the world thing and everyone is judging me is what makes me feel really uneasy had to quit my job because of panic attacks and social anxiety had a traumatic experience due to workplace bullying i once was a very outgoing social person the awful experience changed me would like to volunteer but my fear of people prevents it ive lost trust in the human race im getting help and sisters are supportive i live alone with my pets my husband died 24 years ago have huge problems in crowds and around people i dont know even avoid my neighbors in neighborhood where i have lived almost 50 years wish i could be the person i once was glad i can express myself on this forum i was horribly socially anxious as a child even something small such as passing a paper back required vast mental preparation and the only reason i could do that was because there was no communication involved so bothered was i that i had difficulty turning in my papers i recall an instance in which a teacherwhom i seemed to particularly annoy for whatever reasonscolded me for taking too long on a worksheet youve had plenty of time why arent you finished i was finished i had been finished for quite some time i just couldnt turn in the paperto walk up to the teacher and say here you go was absolutely terrifying it wasnt until i got my first job at 17 that the anxiety got better out of necessity really i notice my anxiety manifest itself differently now instead of being terrified all of the time i have days where i can socialize and days where i cant function in public at all so the anxiety appears at half the time with twice as much potency hi all awesome that we have a new forum i have a dx of social anxiety along with gad and bipolar with psychotic featuresjust one more thing right maybe notwhen i was in jr high i really wouldnt speakpeople my age would say hello and i would just look at them but if a teacher called on me i would answer because id get into trouble if i didnt and that would be more talking id like to say i grew out of it but it was more like after a lot of work i improved i had a guidance counselor who pulled me out of class one day for you guessed it not talkingi thought it was so ironic most students get in trouble for talking in class anyway he told me i had two choices either to join some activities at the school or to continue to see him periodically i didnt want to talk so i joined two clubsi knew they were monitoring me thoughperhaps part of this was paranoia but really school officials have a lot of power and can certainly check up on you so i started very slowly talking to people and after a lot of sweating and anxiety i had a few friends the school left me alone after this but still i never dated until my late 30s so i wasnt totally normal i got cbt for my psychosis but a lot of it dealt with anxiety because it was hand tailored to me so i started dating and right now ive been with my current bf for a yearamazingly he is a huge anxiety reducergoing places with people where you wont be the only one talking is awesomei can talk if i want but dont feel like all the pressure is on me he is naturally social so it doesnt magnify the pressure like some people do i still get nervous when im in charge of things like if i bought the tickets or whatever but its such a relief and worth working towards im not anxiety free but i dont react with the same levels of stress anymore sometimes psychotic sometimes psychotic another one with social anxiety here among others diagnosis socialy anxious since early childhood since ever worsened at my early teenage years and after that no friends anymore being very inhibited is terrible for professional life i restrain myself from choosing this or that path i feel so recluded from the world theres an all world experiences and knowledge that i dont have nor can i do i will share a more in depth story when im available but shortly as of now i was feeling great since i started using meds better than ive ever felt before but now i am starting to feel miserable and i am so much used to feeling well now that i am not accepting this ever i know i need help and i know i cant tell anyone and i know there are only a few things i can do i can accept my path as a genetic alcoholic i can start being anxious every second of the day again or help i cant figure out a third option i was though i dont think this has ever deterred anyone from trying to initiate an interaction in fact they often dont care if im able to hear them seemingly i guess maybe if i wore my big indoors headphones instead of earbuds it would be more obvious in olden times it was actually rude for a gentleman to speak to a lady to whom he had not been introduced that is probably not the case here but ive seen police say on tv that too often people are victimized because they dont want to appear rude but the people who are mugging them are being very rude so dont worry about being rude worry more about how to ensure your walks are undisturbed  maybe walk in slightly less deserted areas hii hang out in the depression and bipolar forum and i suffer from anxiety i want to post this here as well since it is helpful for anxiety it is by dbt peer connections the speaker isnt a therapist but she goes over the dbt therapy techniques pop over to the depression if you want to check out more dbt threads i had such social anxiety i couldnt do presentations one class i had an a in and told the teacher id take a c but i could not present he offered for me to give it just to him and i still couldnt he gave me an a anyway another time i tried really hard to present in front of a large class and my voice started shaking and the professor laughed that incident made up my mind that it is something i am not doing i hate having social anxiety it makes things difficult youre absolutely right people dont get it im glad you have accommodations and are getting the job done kudos to you ok so i was never bullied but ive never really had friends the only friends ive had are my lifelong best friend and his brother i had 2 friends in elementary school one in 2nd grade and one in 5th in middle school i isolated myself and sat at the empty table at lunch and pretty much entertained myself my parents keep bugging me to make friends and talkto people but i dont want to partly because talking to people i dont know gives me this weird anxiety plus im really awkward and partly because i have become comfortable with isolating myself those are my guesses as to why i am this way seriously is this normal i have developed this physical anxiety tight chest a reactive heart knot in my chest for one or two weeks now and i dont know what is causing it ive ruled out the most obvious and common stressors from my routine that could have been causing it the only thing left to rule out is coffee i drink 2 very strong cups of coffee it helps me keep my appetite in check thats the only reason i drink it at all tomorrow i stop drinking coffee altogether and ill know in a couple of days if its the culprit until then i wanted to get your opinions on this subject hi sunny  do you drink enough water  caffeine  dehydrates you  so if you enjoy coffee  have a glass of water with it i have anxiety issues and i understand tachycardia  not fun at all here is the weird thing  if i cant sleep at night  sometimes i will have a cup of coffee  and about a half hour later i am out like a light  really  for some strange reason caffeine makes be sleepy ok so whos crazy  take care keyplayer yeah coffee causes me anxiety as well so i hardly ever drink it anymore its weird but sometimes it has zero effect other times i get very very nervous never have any positive effect of being more awake though my doctor told me to give up coffee because i have bad anxiety i will when im ready right now i want my coffee drinking my second cup as i type lol i switched to decaf a few years ago had a migraine for a couple of days and i was fine i still like the taste of coffee but i feel less anxious now i used to drink a pot of coffee so i wonder why when anxious i have no desire to drink coffee when things calm down i tend to go back for the wake up and also the appetite suppression max is one to two cups a day maybe i should remove it and see how i feel long term havent had any coffee todayso far so goodno physical anxiety no chest anxiety i feel just fine maybe this was it ill know for sure in a few more days thanks for your replies guys appreciate it hi i found that having anxiety andor panic attacks that i had to completely give up all caffeinated drinksi only drink decaf coffee tea etcnothing that will amp me up and i do much better good luck im like this i prefer video games and anime over socializing when i have free time most of the time im content with being like this however there are times when i get lonely and wish i had somebody to talk to i guess the question to ask yourself is are you truly happy if so then there is nothing wrong with living the way you do if not than it might be best to figure out whats bothering you and work on a goal to do something about it sounds a lot like me im not so certain that there is a normal were social animals historically speaking a primate who is alone is a primate who would not be living very long because its our social structure that keeps us alive in modern times our artificial society allows us to be more isolated and to spend money as we engage in very limited and superficial social interactions ie going to the grocery store i had a bunch of friends on social networking something went wrong and i wont get into it here but i learned the hard way that none of them were really my friends since then ive felt some selfapplied pressure to get some friends but then i wonder if i really have to do that in the first place since then ive made one friend by accident its cool we keep things light so no getting into deep or dark personal problems thats why i pay a therapist is it normal my answer to that is that normal doesnt exist if you feel fine then go with what you are doing if you need a friend then you can try to make a friend burdening yourself with what might or might not be normal could lead to forcing the issue and i think that you dont really need to go there you are good for you for your place in time your situation and status will be everchanging based on need and opportunity flow with it all is revealed i have always found friends to be very stressful they add so many things to worry about and pay attention to its overwhelming plus i have trust issues so i always question whether they actually like me i am lucky enough to have a long term friend who is like a sister to me and has seen me at my worst so i dont have to worry about what she thinks of me i do have a few other friends and my relationships with them are good but i have to push through a lot of anxiety to be with them i hope this will get better for you i know it is hard to change the way youve been for essentially your entire life dermald i wasnt ever dxed as selective mutism but i believe i had it during my jr high years my guidance counselor in high school made me join activities and after a year a feeling terrible and anxious and not knowing what to say to anyone without breaking into a sweat i started getting used to it and my anxiety decreased years later i got therapy and that helped much more current friends and loved one actually think im chattyit takes work though to get to a point where you are at ease it does not go away by itself i lost my voice completely for about a year as a child read my voice was beaten out of me until i started dealing with the effects of child abuse  domestic violence i never thought too much about it however since i was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder my selective mutism has become a lot more recognisable i used to discount the incidents where i couldnt speak as a young adult but living in a very violent abusive environment meant mutism happened quite a bit one of my personalities is mostly mute  she created her own sign language to communicate and im still trying to understand it when she surfaces 95 of the time its anxiety that triggers selective mutism in me but sometimes i really dont want to talk at all and when im able to be silent it feels like the most relaxing thing ever those times are rare though i wasnt officially diagnosed with selective mutism but i believe i suffered it as a kid due to social anxiety in my case in kindergarten i wouldnt talk and teachers told my parents that i only said a few words the entire school year if i was called on in class i would tense up ended up biting myself because i was so anxious my parents were told but was still never sent to therapy when i was 14 i ended up failing a few presentations in school because of social anxiety not selective mutism but even when i was chosen in class to answer a question i was so anxious and wanted to cry but anyways i learned about social anxiety disorder and mental illness in general for the first time and i requested that i see a pdoc for my anxiety issues years of therapy and now i am able to answer questions in the class no problem my problems are mainly social anxiety related now than selective mutism i think my problems were always social anxiety but selective mutism was just a severe manifestation of it all when i was younger so now i dont have selective mutism i had never officially been diagnosed with it but i probably did have some form of it i would refuse to talk to teachers uncles aunts etc but would be ok talking with kids my own age this went on until 7th grade it seemed to have come back when i became an adult im 24 and i can only talk to a few people in my group i dont always ignore them but sometime when they say hi i dont really say much of anything to them its like my vocal chords freeze i feel bad but its almost like i am physically unable to speak to them i still struggle with talking to close family members but i am very active on social media so i communicate with family members there i feel bad about it sometimes like we got a new neighbor and i couldnt really say much to her i just froze whats weird though is 1317 i talked fine and was actually very talkative and joked around with people of all ages then when i was 18 the traits of selective mute came back kind of all of a sudden im wondering if it was just an example of the fact that your brain doesnt fully develop until your 18 i really dont know laurie bozdickens if you know how to dance pick a partner if you dont know how to dance pick a partner or alternate hanging around by the food and punch with sitting down i hope it wont be too bad but id be terrified in a situation like that it worked in junior high my best lifelong friend danced with me and we didnt care how we looked it was a lifesaver good luck i had to give a similar speech as salutatorianit wasnt that bad when i was actually up there but as i see it here are your options when they ask tell them to get the salutatorian instead or maybe number 3 if no 2 already gives a speech then youll be off the hook option 2 get therapy or medication to help you before then its likely youll have to give speeches as part of work or college so it helps to get this issue taken care of if you dont give the speech dont be surprised if they force you to see a counselor or some suchschools like comformity thank you all i asked my counselors and they said that the speeches are mandatory if you decide to accept being valedictorian so i think ive decided to just give up the title at least ill still have the high gpa on record i just wanted to thank you all for your advice and input theres a line in hg wells war of the worlds that crosses my mind a lot i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this mysterious deathas swift as the passage of lightwould leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down thats kind of how i feel sometimes im doing so much to get myself to a better place scrambling for safety as it were but i feel i am being toyed with by my anxiety like its just biding its time and will strike at me again just as i reach a good place it took awhile i had to begin by driving with my hubby then when he got tired of going with me to my appointments i had no choice and he needs me to pick him up on occasion i picked him up from the airport last night he is pushing me out of my comfort zone to help me im a little better when i first get behind the wheel but the nervousness makes it difficult to concentrate and ivery made errors that i shouldnt almost causing me to get into accidents it hope to get better with practice a huge step up considering i was paralized by such fear that i once couldnt even leave my bedroom it can be done some triggering material mentioned in this warning i have realized now that i have a really bad fear of pain it mainly shows itself in my fear of falling as i dont want to get hurt if i do fall but i cant say why i am scared of pain i know humans dont like to experience pain but i feel mine is really bad the fear its the main thing that holds me back from possible trigger self harming more severely and suicide function rejtgomb tag

thisinnertext   gombvalue  show   i just am really scared of pain does anybody have problems with being alone specifically if your out in public my anxiety overwhelms me when im out and about its not so bad when i have somebody with me usually a family member but im still on high alert for anything or anybody who may be laughing or looking at me its a weird feeling i get nervous that im going to embarrass myself or look stupid in front of strangers its also worse if im at a gathering with friends i will stay quiet because i dont want to say something stupid i will go as far as avoiding hanging out with my friends too because im soo scared i hate parties or anything like that basically anything where im around people im on alert and terrified i try my best to hide it and im not sure if my friends will understand how scary it is for me to be around people i only feel comfortable hanging out at my house too  if im in my room im okay but if i have to go to their house i start to panic im also scared of driving especially on highways but that stems from my ptsd i lost 4 of my cousins in a wreck when i was 11 and ever since then ive been super scared to drive my mom eventually got me to come around to the idea of driving when i was like 19 and i got my license around 21 idk  i feel like an idiot because these are things i shouldnt be afraid of but i am my anxiety keeps me from doing a lot of things and i wish it would just go away already since 2012 ive gotten bad anxiety after drinking apple juice i mentioned it to my therapist who denied that it made me anxious i has not had apple juice in awhile but yesterday i bought a bottle of 100 percent apple juice i drank about 40 oz of it tonight im literally shaking from my anxiety i realized half an hour ago that it was once again the apple juice i googled it and apple juice is bad for people with anxiety because most apple juice tests positive for arensic which can cause anxious behaviors so it wasnt just in my head does this happen to anyone else ive never really noticed it or payyed much attention to it i get anxious a lot i never wondered was it because i drank apple juice though i dont drink apple juice too much now you have me curious definitely feeling that way here working on cognitive behavior therapy group called recovery inc ive only been to one meeting but it seems promising maybe theres a support group in your area i googled support for agoraphobia and was happy to find something in my area whats cool about it is a lot of healthy ways to change the way we think theres actually probably info in this forum somewhere theres just so much here which is awesome sorry about your cousins thats really sad and can see why you have that ptsd about driving i havent driven on freeways in many years ive been told many times to face my fears a little bit each day i drove one exit on the expressway a few years back and just didnt want to work that hard i guess i wish you the best keep trying and dont give up even the tiny steps are something to feel good about im cheering for you xo sans its also high is sugar maybe its that too that is 110 grams bound to make your blood sugar rise and drop quickly can cause anxiety like feelings no youre not an idiot and i can definitely relate to many of the aspects you mentioned being alone on my own is the best thing for me at this stage but being alone in public my goodness im constantly  and i mean constantly  going through all the coping strategies i know its awful but sometimes i have a good day so thats okay youre not alone in your struggles sonjaward809 trust me theres a good possibility you can work your way through and even overcome these anxieties as well so keep fighting and dont give up youll get there eventually dont worry apple juice can trigger anxious feelings because of the high sugar content which can increase adrenaline and blood sugar this can lead to the feeling of having a panic attack some apple juice can contain arsenic but i doubt it contains enough to evoke such anxious feelings otherwise there would be many more complaints and the brand would not stay on the shelves anxiety is a powerful thing if our brain expects to become anxious from something whether it be apple juice or going outside of the house then it can become a selffulfilling prophecy the best way to overcome that is to expose ourselves to that which makes us anxious if it can be done safely you could also avoid apple juice but i would consider that an avoidance behaviour my anxiety was fine until i realized i had 4 cans and bottles of soda today i really shouldnt be drinking any soda because the effect it has on my teeth not sure why i didnt even realize i was that stressed out but i spent a large portion of the day with the worst tension headache ive ever had ive had this for several years now where my anxiety has got really bad and i have really bad physical pain so i check in to the hospital and say i think im having a heart attack they do all these tests tell me my heart is fine and say its just my level of anxiety few days later it repeats i go back in complain of a heart attack only to waste their time because my heart is fine its natural you get bad anxiety youre gonna have physical stomach pain but i need to stop this heart attack crap its not only wasting their time but its not really helping me either i know my hearts fine so why bother telling them it isnt and have all these tests i have similar anxiety about heart attacks i sometimes get chest pressure which i think is caused by anxiety but i worry when it happens i think part of this for me is my stepdad died of a heart attack at age 56 i am 59 and i know i dont have his genetic risk factors but i still worry sometimes i wish i had an ekg machine at home so i could see i am okay when these episodes occur i have xanax for anxiety but it only makes me sleepy and i still feel anxious my adult children are flying out on a trip together in less than a week anxiety is beginning to build hope youre feeling better now i have what i presume would be called cardiac arrhythmia and i also experience what feels like shortness of breath from timetotime im not actually short of breath but it feels like i am i havent sought medical treatment for any of it though im kindof doctor avoidant pixie1 shattered sanity i get this all the time one thing that helped me was to go for a run and get my heart pumping to overcome the anxiety shattered sanity mulan same here i used to stay running back and forth to hospitals and doctors because i thought i was having a heart attack even went to a specialist for the heart of course nothing wrong with my ticker just my anxiety as usual its hard but put things in perspective if i were really having one would i be upright and able to complain about it thats how i get through mines thats deffenetly a thought i dont think if i was having one idd be able to complain about it anyway hmm i dont know where is the heart anyway is it on the left or the right does this happen to anyone else i have a bad habit of worrying about bad stuff that didnt happen sometimes i get so sick to my stomach thinking of what could have happened one thing that really bothers me is when i got my wisdom teeth out my doctor said i could take my meds but i decided to wait until after the surgery i didnt wake up right away from being put to sleep it almost seemed like they were panicking when i finally came to it im so scared that if i had taken my meds i would have died also i dropped my electric toothbrush cord into the sink with the water running and i stupidly impulsively reached for it and took it out of the sink right after that i got sick to my stomach realizing i could of been electrocuted ok these bad things didnt happen so shouldnt i just let them go am i alone do you get anxious over seemingly trivial matters do you feel embarassed and guilt ridden awkward i do all the time and i worry even more that people will laugh or think i am weird i feel humiliated as a result all too often tonight i am supposed to be test driving several vehicles on my short list i have been worrying about this since i made the appointment yesterday and this worry is going to fester all day today i am worried that i will make a fool of myself in front of the salesman who no doubt will come along ive had no car of my own for near two years so dont drive often i am in a new city i am unfamiliar with this shouldnt be difficult though so i feel idiotic as well why do i make mountains out of mole hills people take test drives all the time this is such a stupid thing to be frightened of there is so much more going on in my life to feel anxious about rather than this trivial matter you are not alone i obsess and worry about those types of things like going through check out lanes in the grocery store once you start worrying its hard to stop but once you are there it gets a little easier and afterwards you think ok that wasnt as bad as i imagined that is anxiety for you playing with your imagination your feelings and makes you feel stupid after too but i try to take it each time as a mm on a ruler i will go forward a bit each time and maybe one day i wont need the whole day to mentally prepare a run to go get groceries deejay14 i went to the doctors about chest pain which i assume is anxiety but they wanted to do some tests and one was an ecg and you have to be naked waist up and i hate it when i know someone will look at me in general but it was very anxiety provoking she kept trying to tell me to relax but that wasnt going to happen with me being half naked she kept saying its a painless test and i honestly didnt care about the pain i just didnt want to have my chest exposed this has always been a trigger for me for years i cant wear a v neck shirt because i am afraid of people looking at me now i also get anxiety from gender dysphoria too so this didnt help how do you deal with anxiety about people looking at you nakedhalfnakedexposed key tones i havent been to the doctor in years or the dentist too afraid i wish i had advice what if you told them your anxiety perhaps they can cover you up once electrodes are attached or same sex nurses etc i am sure they have had patients with anxiety before and might be able to make adjustments nike007 i had a panic attack while having my last ecg im not comfortable either but i just suck it up because it needs to be done nike007 nike ive had several of these tests and on each occasion i was given an open gown to wear they were able to reach beneath the gown to attach the sensors while i still felt vulnerable i wasnt completed exposed so i am really bothered by how they did this in your case in the future ask if you can have a gown to wear in the meantime i feel your awkwardness and humiliation it is frightening enough just having to have such a test to begin with let alone humiliating you and making you all the more anxious nike007 i tend to use a script when talking to people and if something is asked and i dont know how to respond right away i get really anxious strangers tend to make me really anxious the former is just because i have autism but the strangers part is more social anxiety unhinged88 i feel like i hate having to dumb myself down when talking to certain people that bring up conversations with me that are completely uninteresting and petty i struggle with being nice to other girls in particular because i feel like im surrounded by simple minded people that do not have any interest at all in engaging themselves in current topics or their personal thoughts and beliefs on science research society etc my boyfriend probably hates bringing me around his friends wives dowdythefifth i went to go play at an open mic at this music shop i felt a bit clumsymore so my anxiety was making me shake so i tried moving around while playing alot of people played before i did now this is what is worrying me i bumped into the microphone and my mouth touched it i am a bit on edge as i keep hearing on the news about the flu and pneumiaspelling i was already on antibiotics for 10 days because i went to the doctor and he told me i had bronchitis im worried that could turn into something worse since my mouth touched the mic when i got back home i immediatly washed my face and brushed my teeth this is probably dumb to worry about anyone else get anxiety over stuff like this trace14 anyone else have this for example imwould not say im a germaphobe im more just afraid of getting sick from germs last night i took my glasses off and kinda tossed them on my desk but a few seconds later they fell on the ground and ive just ever since been worrying even if i wash them they are gonna have germs on them and make me sick when i eventually have to wear them again does anyone else get anxiety over things similiar like this im a microbiologistright now the bacteria in poop are the hottest new trendpeople are getting other peoples poop implanted to help cure disease this is an actual medical procedure in comparison your glasses will be fine any one here ever have anxiety attacks while sleeping its weird how it happened  i was sleep like usual maybe partially awake subconsciously i thought someone else was walking in my house i woke up immediately frozen still couldnt move its like i was paralyzed i could move eventually within in seconds but i tried to keep still because i really thought there was an intruder of course the thoughts were rolling in my head what if someone was really in the house what if they hurt my grandma or aunt what if i was having some physical ailment like a stroke no one else was in the house and ive calmed down but im still a little freaked out about this anyone else ever experienced having anxiety attacks during your sleep and if so howd you cope oh geez i do not like going anywhere during flu season because i freak about catching something there i wont touch my food with my bare hands if i havent washed them at least twice before sometimes this gets really annoying its more embarrassing than anything else yet i did mention it to my therapist and turns out she feels similar sometimes at least i got a huge laugh out of it thinking oh well then it cant be too bad if you think your therapist is helping ask if there is a way to see her after university if she cant ask if she can refer you to someone with the same methods as her the last therapist i saw for about 2 years things started out pretty well but it was towards the end i realized i wasnt any better now than i was when i started and i only felt good when in the session i tried pretty much every intervention she offered but nothing seemed to work after she betrayed my trust and agreed with my wife things really took a dive i started seeing her once a month cuz insurance did not pay and money is tight but it got to be the same conversation every month  this sounds kindof like sleep paralysis i havent had any episodes of it now for quite a few years but when i was young i did and for years i didnt understand what was happening it was terrifying i gradually learned to focus my attention on the index finger of my right hand and once i could move that the paralysis dissipated ive read that sleep paralysis is more likely to occur if one is sleeping on ones back one of the sleep paralysis dreams i had was i was at one of my aunts homes their house was on a busy street  had a long driveway in my dream i was laying down crosswise of the driveway  i would roll out into the street there would be cars coming but i couldnt get out of the way it seems funny now but at the time i recall being scared stiff pun intended i know from reading other members posts on this subject that other people whove had sleep paralysis have had different experiences some as i recall not dissimilar to yours anyway hopefully in your case this is just a oneoff  you wont continue to have these experiences i wish you well all the time i have ocd too so thats what causes mine im constantly cleaning and disinfecting things with flu season in full effect im a little worried about it i got the flu shot for the first time in 8 years im terrified i made kind of a big fuss and made my brother get his first flu shot in his life i have not gotten the flu since 2006 and ive only had the flu shot 3 times since then so im praying im ok with the flu shot it seems the incidents ive heard about on the news are about people who didnt get the flu shot i get anxiety about bad stuff that didnt happen and im worried if i hadnt seen this article on facebook i wouldnt have thought to get the flu shot i basically live under a rock and dont pay attention to current events like i had no idea about the government shut down until it actually happened do you find that your responses to social interactions happens instinctively or do you have to consciously go through your memory to retrieve information on how youre supposed to actrespond im horrible at interacting with others in person heck even on the phone i have trouble unless im superrr comfortable with them most of the time im quiet because i dont know what to say or that im going to embarrass myself i try to remember what to say but i go blank 90 of the time im okay with my most immediate family members but new people usually think im rude because i wont speak little do they know im just terrified lol hopefully one day talking to others gets better i am pretty good not necessarily comfortable though i figure i come from the idea that a good offense is the best defense inwardly it is painful but i put on a mask of gregarious confidence i am fighting the urge to take flight but force myself to work the room it is exhausting always being at the ready i feel like im either too sharp or too loud when i talk to people i dont feel comfortable at all i am pretty good with strangers because i know i wont have to come up with more stuff to talk about because ill only see them for a short time when it comes to having to get to know someone thats when i feel my most uncomfortable im struggling with this right now very very much happy new year everyone anxious today but not as much as usual just some mild stomach pain im stressed though just have a lot on my mind lately i can respond and make conversations okay as long as my mood is stable but i do need to make sure my mind doesnt start racing by keeping myself composed but no ive always found social interactions to be difficult i have a lot of trust issues was okay for a while there but then it got worse i think ill be working on it for the rest of my life to be honest i have social anxiety so no unfortunately preface i am slightly autistic i have aspergers syndrome i wonder if that contributes to these issues i have been obsessed and overstressed by this math competition i have to take very soon i am not very good at it on top of that i believe it is causing me very high stress to the point of disassociation and delusion yesterday just before bed i worked for a very long time on practicing for the competition i barely understood what i was doing and spent a lot of my energy that was a bad idea since i created an extreme amount of stress i suddenly became aware that i was deathly tired i became convinced i would die i was going to die in my sleep i also became convinced i was in dreamland again my mind when under high stress tends to turn the most random noises into the scariest noises scary voices sounds etc i also have the tendency to become paranoid over the dumbest things for instance last week i heard one of those emergency tests on the radio they accidentally made a mistake and said civil danger warning i must of missed them saying it was a test because i then became convinced north korea was sending a nuclear bomb i then became convinced that i was in a dream and my family was not real later that day i couldnt find my brother and i began to doubt his existence all year i was paranoid about going outside before 300 i thought i was going to be caught by police and accused of escaping school i am actually homeschooled so i get school done quicker i am also 2 grade levels ahead i tested 97 percentile on the california achievement test i am still worried about going outside  im afraid the police will not like me flying my drone around note i do go outside and i always become anxious at night time if i had a bad day i can turn shadows in my room into the scariest things inside my mind thats not the worst of it one night i was convinced that there was a blackclothed ghost with a white face hiding in the corner of the room with an axe for me i did not hallucinate it i just feared it i went and got a glass of water and the fear did seem to subside when i was younger i was often paranoid about a chimpanzee that was going to kill me i was scared of going to the zoo for years i still am a bit when i am under stress i doubt reality and often fill in areas of my day that i forgot in my mind with dreams this leads to me getting my dreammemories mixed up with real life my dreams are extremely realistic is there a scientific explanation for this and is there a scientific name for this  thanks everyone i find it difficult when i feel trapped by a conversation i dont know when the other person is going to stop talking or how i can get out of it without being rude or abrupt i dont like first inpressions when one on one like interviews but besides that i dont usually get nervous in social situations if anything i get irritated by all the people moteofsoul i get uncomfortable talking to strangers or people i havent seen in a while specially on social gatherings i crave social interactions but i also find them draining to me conversations have patterns its like a dance or a tennis match one wrong reply could mess up the rhythm or lose the game i get tired of being super nice so not to cause offence i get tired of my older colleagues who dont like to listen to me just because im younger i pretty much memorise the pattern of certain conversations hi how are you im fine thanks how are you did you have a good weekend it was ok how was yours and so on i have to go through my memory before hand to plan out what im going to say even non face to face conversations i have to plan out before engaging in them ok so my nose is huge and the main cause of my anxiety and i always think people are laughing at it when im out of the house am i being realistic i was in another forum and they said i might have bdd but i feel like im being realisticshould i save up for surgery your nose looks perfectly normal to me and im not saying that just to be nice if you got surgery on it it would actually look too small have you considered therapy for your bdd outkast3000 i hope you will continue to go to counselling for this it must be difficult to see something one way and have everyone else say different but please believe me when i say your nose looks fine ok outkast3000 i was expecting to see a large nose its really not that big outkast3000 it isnt big at all id say it is normal sized anxiety growing with each new day i am feeling less confident and more and more worthless too i have to find a job  soon i received my last disability check today and will need an income with which to pay rent come february i knew full well this was a crappy time of year to be looking for one as of this date i have applied for 26 jobs  and not heard from a single one this is all very disconcerting and hits my confidence and selfesteem quite hard what is wrong with me i am asking myself it is reaching the point that i worry too that i am suffering paranoia and jumping to every negative conclusion that can be thought of this is not a situation i have ever been in before ive normally had a choice of job offers i am really freaking out jennifer 1967 hi everyone ive been working with a therapist for the past 6 months as ive been struggling with my mental health again over the years it has manifested itself in different forms from ocdhoarding germ fear contamination fear weight losseating disorders i could go on it peaks and troughs and normally emerges after a period of stress working with my therapist weve finally come to the bottom of something and believe it stems from separation anxiety disorder as a very young child i was incredibly clingy and didnt spend a day away from my mum until i was 15 never stayed over at friends never went away on trips trouble sleeping didnt want to be left alone etc classic sad which unfortunately my parents didnt recognise and didnt nip in the bud fast forward 37 years and we believe this is likely at the root of my ongoing issues my question is how do i resolve this clearly i dont have sad from my parents anymore so how is it resolved ive tried treating the symptoms directly such as ocd as and when they manifest with limited success but something always reemerges and i want it to stop i meditate take herbal antianxiety supplements write poetry and talk it through with my therapist but really want to tackle the underlying issue head on any help greatly appreciated thanks steve still dont know what hours daughters boyfriend will be working christmas eve im rather nervous about this because i want to be able to plan that day and know what were doing it makes me anxious that he waits until the last minute to do things it reminds me of my last abuser who did the same thing and bragged about it on the plus side everyone liked the apple pie so i will do hat friday my daughter is still making cookies on saturday for her boyfriends familys holiday dinner try to work on new software to stay busy so yeah that kind of day anxious restless headaches made it through my bad anxiety over driving to place im not familiar and working in a not so great part of town today it was really hard for me dealing with a lot of anxiety over insurance changes too hello steve i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit im sorry i cannot be of help with regard to your concerns however here are links to 2 articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of some interest i dont know of course if youre here simply seeking advice with regard to this particular concern or if you plan to hang in here with us however should you be planning to continue on we hope you do may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting ps one other thing i can offer is that trying to stop something such anxiety intrusive thoughts etc is i believe prettymuch generally recognized not to work in fact it tends to make matters worse there is a practice that is referred to as compassionate abiding wherein one simply allows ones anxiety intrusive thoughts or whatever to arise  fade at their own pace without reacting to them or fighting against them you mentioned that you meditate compassionate abiding would fit in nicely with that practice heres a link to a description of the practice may it be of benefit i was in the same boat as you always with my parents as some point or another up until college i had very little friends and didnt really hang out like most teens should in college it did get better i started being more social and more away from my parents i still struggle with anxiety ocd and depression but its much better you said it reemerges is something that triggers the symptoms to reemerges when that happens to me usually say im having a setback and i try find what triggered my setback finding the source then helps me realize what i fears and triggers i still need to work on i flood a lot of toilets pretty much every one except my own although i do flood it quite a bit i completely flooded a doctors office and i made quite a mess in a big lots i also messed up my uncles so now im terrified of using anyones toilet except to pee its gotten to the point where im so uncomfortable but i refuse to go except at my own its not even really a fear its just a bad idea to use anyone elses toilet does anyone have any suggestions isnt it just obvious i should wait until i get home btw i dont eat that much and what i do eat is pretty healthy so i have no idea whats going on flush two or three times along the way rather than waiting until the end either youre passing constipated stool or your using an awful lot of toilet paper miralax get the generic version of it is a great product for keeping one regular its never a good idea to wait go when the spirit moves you right away healthy eating tends to produce larger stool due to greater amount of fiber ive read that often the largest component of human stool after water is bacteria more than likely tmi but i have a real problem with diarrh both from anxiety and as a side effect of my bipolar meds i have found that taking imodium twice a week has made things almost normal i have the too soft problem myself and it likely stems from all the anxiety it possesses its own problems while in a public washroom and i try not to go if i can help it i agree about the consideration of how much toilet paper is being used i was clogging my own toilet on risperidone i was so constipatedit could very well be your meds i was eating almost entirely vegetarian so it wasnt low fiber for me i changed to abilify and that helped a lot bozdickens hi folks i am wondering if anyone of you has developed strategies to get over this constant brain fog caused by anxiety no physical reasons i find it really hard to focus and all i pay attention to is this fogginess in my head that comes with pressure i cant really think clearly and it is just starting to annoy the hell out of me i have tried relaxation but i cant even focus on that anything that has worked for you hmmmm well i dont know as i have any particularly great strategies to offer you but i certainly understand the problem i have a lot of freefloating anxiety i dont even have anything to feel anxious about but im an older person and i think after so many years filled with anxiety my body just doesnt know how to function any other way plus i have menieres disease a condition of the inner ear that causes tinnitus dizziness  balance issues so i experience what i typically refer to as a headinafishbowl kind of effect prettymuch 24 7 i walk our dog a couple of times a day and this seems to help at least temporarily ive never found sitting meditation or relaxation techniques to be particularly helpful i do some walking meditation  ive done some mindfulness yoga but basically i just live with my brain fog i dont know how one gets rid of it there is a technique which is referred to as compassionate abiding which might be of some help to you heres a link to a description of the practice may it be of benefit so does mindfulness and positive thinking really work i havent had much luck lots of negative thoughts since i have been verbally abused moms there to smash any ambition i have after working over 60 hours in a 3day span i dont have the energy to have anxiety hi palsera i really believe mindfulness and positive thinking work and its a constant effort to use them for some of us its natural and easy to think negatively it requires work to replace the negative thoughts i like to watch mindfulness videos on youtube and also hypnotherapy videos for positive thinking best wishes on your path sans and i was the last poster in that thread i feel so honoured i really do feeling really tired and depressed with physical aches and pains to match still anxious but this has sunk me to a new low i went back to work today after having last week off i am surprised that my anxiety level wasnt severe today although i have a headache tonight azureseas im so impressed how well u all seem to handle this anxiety monster handled a lot of things but this anxiety is winning need to go grocery shopping but dont want to leave the house even with anxiety pills in my pocket purse car always within reach course being in control of myself has always been my thing if powers that be r trying to teach me something i dont know what it is but i officially holler uncle having a good day preparing myself for a very long 2 weeks im feeling okay at the moment nothing extreme in november last month ive been dealing with daily bouts of anxiety that go up and down it sucks but i still manage to maintain despite my anxiety i had an anxiety attack this morning my stomach stills feels uneasy i see pdoc tonight im nervous i have nothing against pdoc but her office triggers my ptsd a bit so it can be hard to go there but shes a good

wishes and positive vibes doing better looking forward to tomorrow hope everyone gets through the holidays with some peace i saw the therapist today and talked about a few rough dates ahead she suggested i get a prescription i havent been taking my pills during the day because i need to stay sharp at work i just realized that i could open my gabapentin capsules and dump out half and that may be all i need im going to try that made cinnamon rolls this morning ugh too much sugar now im jittery and waiting for this afternoon is taking forever i woke up from a dream believing i had gained 60 pounds back that i lost many years ago which gave me an anxiety attack it took me years to get that weight off ive calmed down but im still feeling a little nervous i was admitted to a mother and baby unit for postnatal depression and anxiety my husband has been abusive i reported him they have me on medication to help calm me i cant go home to him im hoping the domestic abuse workers can help me but everything has been on standstill over christmas im afraid of how hell react when he finds out i reported him and im not coming home i havent posted here for a while regarding my anxiety i have been in such a state for weeks and now i am in all out fear and stress mode my disability assistance is being cut off the last cheque is for january i am struggling to find work i need an income in january so as to pay my rent for february christmas is over whew my husband and i are working on goals for next year like everything else its dependent on keeping track of things and having selfdiscipline i am really nervous about next year though so i hope outside influences dont ruin everything acuphoria quiet day today nervous but feeling a little more hopeful i have been feeling tense and sort of anxious due to having an anxiety attack last week i want to get my mind occupied again but my college class doesnt start until next month i only have 4h left to sleep but i cant stop stressing about tomorrow night i wish i could just cancel all my plans and run away and hide from the world until like the 2nd week of january this time of the year is extremely difficult and its triggering so many memories that im not being able to cope with thanks for posting this link ive been through dbt training but am a little rusty this is great was starting to feel better then a bunch of little annoyances happened glasses broke hard drive crashed lucky it was part of a raid so i didnt lose anything spilled coffee all over my sweaterthe list goes on plus my sleep was disrupted and had strange dreams despite all this im okay im grateful we had money to replace the drive and my husband used a nose piece from an old pair of glasses happy new year to those that celebrate it happy new year sending hugs and best wishes to everyone on the thread for a peaceful healing 2018 im up past 4 am i just dont want to go to bed because i dont want to face the morning my typical morning anxiety seems like it might be worse being the last day off before i go back to work and having to face the new year as well january is the worst month with quarterend work plus yearend work i did fairly well the past few days while out of the house on my staycation i had my phone with me so i guess i had my main distraction that i used intermittently i had trouble with the long drives so i just resorted to daydreaming to distract myself from anxious thoughts i nearly missed an exit i wish i could just be comfortable enough to be present frankly i could have had a real vacation but i just didnt feel up to it sadly im glad we didnt go anywhere because i just want to be home and happy new year to everyone i had a massive panic attack today still feeling the aftermath had a panic attack after finding out the cause of my recent severe anxiety will this never end anxious day today and the first day back to work coming on the forum relieved it but that isnt the way to get work done its going to be a busy month with all the yearend reporting i found a roof vent on the ground but i dont know if it is mine or my neighbors since it landed between our houses im worried that i might have raccoons in the attic i have a roof inspector coming over tomorrow it feels good to be back and enjoy time off my therapist threw me under the bus after five consultations called four law enforcement officers with guns drawn and abandoned me i never touched her in anyway but a genteel handshake i kept reassuring her i would never harm you which is true  i would feel less than a man to hit a woman which i have never did in my life if i was suicidal i would have killed myself with four officers yelling  we know you are in there  do you want us to knock down your door we are coming in i didnt open it  felt like saying  get a warrant they didnt come in after five therapy sessions my treatment was look at these meditation videos on the internet and law enforcement which really helped my anxiety disorder which i suffer from  dont you think callmeraven moderation i agree with raven id see someone else not all professionals are like that i get why i was anxious yesterday  dentist appt with hygienist so close to me hanging over my head followed by eating in a restaurant but today i cannot stop shaking at work and there is literally no one else around in my office to make me feel anxious yes i will find another therapist this one was  too young 2 yrs in practice  too impulsive  and too affected by what her patients say or write instead of analyzing what i was saying and why she couldnt handle me i think i made her insane i told her you know  if you are uncomfortable with patients  i know a therapist you can see granted my conversations were not politically correct and polite but never rude  i thought i should open up to her so she should know the bad stuff about me to plan a treatment plan to make me a better person sincerely moderation moderation my anxiety is very very high today started and finished a project for my home office like most house things i was driven to finish everything today i would have to force myself to stop so i can rest my body i was anxious and restless until it was done so now im sore and tired and i still have to make dinner ugh we could go out but this is a lean month and we already bought a bunch of groceries i started out the week with low anxiety and a sense of control i think it was the relief of the holidays being over today after 4 days at work my anxiety is high again all day things were going wrong at work and i felt angry and irritable at people and objects its rare that i get angrymost things dont affect me in that way a big difference from my calm tuesday struggling this morning with anxiety and feeling depressed so sad that the anxious part of my mind steals hours and days from methis has to stop i hate it jenniferim so sorry i hope youre feeling better i am working with the anxiety i was able to get the laundry done i usually do the minimum but today i decided to try to do more i did a little more around the place maybe 45 min worth not a lot but more than the bare minimum much needed and not perfect been feeling restless today  like i cant sit still ugh its irritating  i dont have any antianxiety meds because the clinic i go to wont fill my prescription for ativan even though its the only thing ive tried that works ive tried buspar hydroxyzine and gapabentin but none of them ever helped so i have to wait until the 22nd to see my pdoc and see if he will push the prescription through i doubt he will he will probably tell me to keep trying the hydroxyzine but its been a few months that ive been on it and it doesnt work tough time for the four officers with their guns drawn after what my therapist probably told them they thought i was going to kill them  no way my father was a police officer  but its like you read in the news  the police get the wrong information and come scared and ready to kill i did tell my therapist i defended myself outside a bar after i was attacked by three 64 250 lb drunks who didnt like me buying drinks and talking to their girlfriends all night but waited until i left to confront me in the parking lot to attack me i warned the boys you really dont want to do this they laughed im 58 170 but a brown belt in karate a bigger bruce lee they started to attack me and well after 5min they wished they wouldnt have attacked me they were all sleeping fine just unconscious maybe when they wake up they wont do this to someone else i am feeling quite panicky tonight its been building up all afternoon and im not sure whats really caused it i think part of its down to losing lots of time hours and part of its because i dropped my phone on the floor and now i cant turn it on and may need to get a new one i also feel rather full because i ate my takeaway way too quickly which i know i shouldnt do but what ever its done now i just hope i dont have a panic attack tonight but it does feel like i might you know when you just know moderation moderation i got through the night without having a panic attack and i was so close to having one so its good i didnt anxiety is currently quite low a little bit of anxiety but i cant really place what its over moderation hi moderation is it weird i thought you were another admin account you know moderators welcome to the forum that should give you some information about what they are but with that said its diffrent for diffrent people and for me one of the worst things is not being able to breav i hope you like the forums moderation having severe anxiety and panic attacks over a surgery im undergoing tomorrow just cant calm down worse attack ive had yet its not even particularly risky i

this afternoon weve been putting it off but now we cant i still have lights draped over the mantle so im good there i dont like waiting until the last minute but with us being sick and having appointments there wasnt much to do im biting the anxiety bullet really high anxiety today so thism orning i got an email asking if on monday this monday soeone can come and see me and talk my move to this new place in febuary remember i got evicted well it took me ages to respond because i dont want to know the day i sort of do but knowing it will increase my anxiety as their are other issues to deal with such as strange people agoraphobia but i eventually wrote back agreeing to see them monday afternoon i just hope ive made the right decision and i can cope with the outcome anxiety is controlling me today someone has been trying to contact me that i really dont want to talk to but i emailed him and agreed to phone him today to get it over withi hope that will help even though i dread the call i feel like ive had a panic attack on my tail all day but i managed to outmaneuver and avoid it and had a decent day instead  im very tired of fighting the battle with anxiety why cant i just be calm i have nothing bad happening in my life just the opposite but im scared and confused i just want to relax a little and enjoy my life why do i struggle with this im reading all types of things to try but i struggle to take consistent action i guess im looking for a magical fix instead of the hard work it takes to improve i tend to do the minimum and therein lies my major problem i think i have an aversion to hard work and so im stuck in this crappy mood where i feel like a scared little kid i talked to the person that was wanting to contact me i feel a slight relief it is strange how certain situations can ramp up the anxiety the situation might even be as simple as having to talk to someone that feels like a threat the person i talked to was nice to me i think i was overly worried about being embarrassed by the topic he was contacting me about i did feel some of that and some worry about his judgement i have to learn to stop letting fear of judgement and embarrassment stop controlling me how do you learn to let go of that fear just got up the jury is still out yesterday was a doozy our small treadmill turned out to be over 200 lbs we had a heck of a time getting it down to the basement my husband and i are so sore i kept apologizing for buying such a heavy piece had another early morning finished my homework for the week probably will chill out for most of the day and maybe take a nap my anxiety isnt bad but will know more later today very relaxed some anxiety about stomach pains but other than that im just peachy daughters boyfriend lost his bearded dragon this morning he had it since he was nine or so and it was old he was really upset and touchy so were all trying to soothe him and help him out he went to work early to get his mind off of it but we know how it goes im concerned i may have some rebound anxiety that i sometimes have when im taking care of other people in crisis i seem to be okay for the moment other than that and pushing a bunch of snow off the drivewayi would say it was a quiet day but it just hasnt made muffins for breakfast because theres no way we were going to risk our necks and only car out in this snow waiting news on the dog adoption tick tock tick tock callmeraven still the waiting game in the meantime my military disability benefit was approved i am really anxious  and shouldnt be what if they deem me not sick enough to have been awarded it i worry about the walk to the meeting the sidewalks are sheets of glare ice i have boot krampons but am still terrified to go out onto the street agitated my anxiety has been pretty good today only flared up when i had to go grocery shopping by myself a few hours ago i tend to panic a little in public if im alone but that feeling is gone now that im home i did manage to walk to the gas station by myself today though it was mainly just cold and my anxiety was only hightened when i was walking there mainly because it was icy and i was scared of embarrassing myself by slipping and falling or that a stranger would try and talk to me im really nervous about people i dont know but thankfully i didnt fall i slipped a few times but that was it overall it was a good day for my anxiety emotional rollercoaster day so that hasnt helped the anxiety hope that ill settle down here soon callmeraven deejay14 well today was a good day for my anxiety considering i didnt wake up till around noon then fell back asleep for 4 hours at 12 pm  so most of my day i was asleep i had a hard time sleeping last night though i felt woundup  had to take a seroquel to finally get some sleep i think the seroquel is why i was soo tired today though so im going to try and skip it tonight if possible overall though my anxiety hasnt been pretty bad these past few days i get worried though because im scared it will all come back at once then ill panic and i dont have any prns for my anxiety anymore so ill be a mess doing better today though ive been munching on carbs all day after my physical therapy session i did some aerobic work as well so that may be why i have to get labs done tomorrow for my pnurse and this probably wont help my blood glucose any my daughter went to our community mental health center to make an initial appt for her depression and anxiety they told her to come back as a walkin and she panicked i managed to calm her down and made a plan for next wednesday in case she wants support from us she could call as well but she has bad phone phobia as well its amazing how i can be so calm for my family while the inside of me is churning like a tornado i am in good space right now amandabroken husband now has pinkeye as well as a sinus infection plus a fungal rash on his leg poor guy did get some homework done before i take my first exam i have 4 exams plus the final my professor is allowing us to work ahead so ill do that also picked up my meds and got labs done feeling pretty calm with a bit of background worry for my hubby sending good thoughts and prayers to all who need them my anxiety has been on and off today its been one of thiose days where im okay for a while then get anxious over nothing in particular then ill be fine again and so on i hate when i get anxious over nothing it always makes me confused i mean how can you be anxious over something if you dont know whats making you anxious lets face it anxiety is weird we panic over weird things what i want to know for the sheer reason of community and not feeling alone is what is the weirdest thing youve had an anxiety or panic attack about mine was a menu that could be vaguely confusing even though i understood it sexual initiation the ptsd about it has ruined my life the weirdest feeling for me is being on a med that stops the physical symptoms of anxiety and i feel great but when i have too much time to sit and think i start panicking in my mind and thinking omg maybe im dying because my heart isnt racing then i start breathing all weird basically panicking about not having a panic attack i feel overwhelmed by all the phone calls i have to do on tuesday all kinds of things are happening the wrong way i hope i can clear it all up im dreading it being touched on the face by a flower im alergic to wasps and it really got me i had a panic attack that lasted forever the voices in my head were screaming i was totally breathless i was frozen to the spot it was horrible the person looked at me like id lost my ing mind and started shouting what are you doing its a cute yellow flower its lovely but i think by that time they may as well be talking to the flower theyd have got more of a response the other weirdest time was when i got diffrent shaped chips fries of course i thought theyd not taste the same they had poison in them they had been cooked wrong and their i went again that time i even got a really bad pain in my kneck phantom pain that is or that time i totally flipped over the factt i was missing my wwe wrestling and took to sending threatening messages to random people give my wrestling to me or else only to find out 20 minits later that the wrestling that week was on a saturday not a friday embarrassed much and then i pannicked again because wrestling falls on fridays in england not saturdays my husband was 15 minutes late getting home i mean really i thought he was dead lol silliest thing was i checked out of a nice hotel because they kept playing the same three songs on a sound track total meltdown werewoman making dinner and it wasnt that hard of a recipe i just couldnt do it thankfully my husband did reality tv being on facebook i deactivate my account all the time when anxiety gets me its frustrating doing laundry got some stuff for the hubby and finished one of my exams for school chilling out with some spa music at the moment it was strange i was doing the exam and my daughter was talking about one of her friends who was being dragged along by a narcissist at least she realized that she didnt want to deal with the drama and wants to arrange a game group without the offending people around she has such a big heart and it hurts sometimes but im proud of her as well read some info about what i was worrying about i dont know if it will happen i hope not got him to pick up a multivitamin to go with his everexpanding group of meds hope it will help without having a ms flare im doing okay at the moment i woke up anxious and had to take my prn i tend to get both done when im like this something happened that i thought would make me feel better did but it was shortlived and im anxious about that too its frustrating what my mind does to me have a sinus headache other than that im okay sigh i was so ready to talk to the therapist today she didnt show up to the appointmentshe forgot to put me on the calendar i have work anxiety creeping in on me again evenings are good because i take my meds then was a tough day back at work we lost a 6yearold boy in the er cant get the moms face out of my head when i had to tell her the news my daughter always seems to know when this happens must be how hard i hugged her when i got home luvyrself high anxiety this evening after someone knocked on back door and said sorry wrong house on high alert i was watching street  spotted someone walking down the middle same person only this time he had a sock hat on i asked if he found right house  he walks to porch to tell me he lost his phone batterywhich was a lie because i could see phone display was lit i told him not to come back to this house waited for neighbor to get home  told him so his wife  daughter would be alert fortunately theres a lot of dogs in the neighborhood im getting porch light repaired tomorrow for the back entrance we use to come  go hugs to those that want them health anxiety is up i strained my back in aqua therapy i also have almost all of my blood test results and more of them are slightly off though one that was typically high has returned to normal i have some ideas as to the cause but my doc is still on maternity leave and i dont know when shell be back my pnurse may also have something to say but thats not until next week ill keep off dr google and hope to have something later otherwise im doing okay shattered sanity my first panic attack going to my sisters pool party wearing a swimsuit after cosmetic surgery thesadgirl tishabuv i like mindscom i call it not facebook because it is a truly uncensored site except of course for illegal posts my friends relationship problems i worry a lot about how his relationship is going the anxiety of worrying i may slip on the ice and either look like an idiot or seriously hurt myself is unbearable i have boot krampons to prevent this yet it is all that i think about when out of doors i have this thing about not wanting any family members and espeacially any of brothers to tickle me the idea of it happening makes my skin crawl i think that in part it is because of my knismolagnia so tickling is something very personal to me and being put through a situation like that would feel like a form of molestation to me i even had to word that last sentence a certain way on the count of these feelings i get anxious my wisdom teeth are going to somehow grow back thought i was going to have a heart attack in a work meeting that included a room full of physicians my heart was beating so fast i could see my shirt moving and i could hear it in my ears my only thought was well if i have a heart attack i guess im in a good place to have it  i remember getting really nervous while making a smoothie one day i have a super weird fear that the blender is going to explode when it turns on i still quite havent conquered that fear yet  using the toaster i always think its going to catch fire even if its unplugged taking medicine for anxiety when i was first given vistaril i had an anxiety attack about taking it my other weird one is being in a car right now my mind keeps telling me i am going to be an accident so i have pretty much refused to get in a car unless i absolutely have to not having my portions correctly weighed out while cooking food at home my poor boyfriend just held me trying his hardest not to look confused i am so tired of the rollercoaster i had lots of anxiety on monday and was fairly calm yesterday im back to feeling the anxiety today i wish i could figure out what was different about yesterday first appointment with a new therapist friday im already nervous about it a couple of times ive had near panic attacks when i suddenly realized i forgot to say thank you to strangers for small nice things they did like moving to one side on a narrow footpath so i could pass for instance what an awful horrible person i am i need to scour the earth searching for that stranger to explain why i forgot to say thank you i hope they will forgive me i mean its ridiculous really i got nervous going to the store for some reason im still not sure why i was nervous in the first place lol it was the only time i ever felt nervous going somewhere i dont experience anxiety though i merely get some butterflies in my stomach and maybe a twitch i was scared that i was the only real being in the universe once 2 words that make me really anxious for some reason i seem to associate them with abuse please especially like please just ing do it or else the reason why im posting this is because i want to know how i can look normal when people say those words to me everytime someone says please or thank you i tend to cringe and then shiver and people look at me waaaaa but those are good positive words i dont want that reaction but its hard because of the association i have i hate please too my mother never used it except very coercively it was never like set the table please more like please change the course of your life so i can win this argument thats how i feel with i love you yea ok sure you do you dont hurt people you love my guess is maybe with time you might just react less but feel the same or with therapy maybe you will feel less negativity associated with them its something people say to get you to do what they want or to patch up after something bad happened in my opinion not many say i love you and actually mean it its a tool manipulators use fuzzybear i get very anxious when a family member of mine gets sicki am even too nervous to call the doctor or take them to the hospital does anyone else feel like this and how do you overcome this perhaps another friend or family member could help you out i recently started noticing  im not sure if its my anxiety i was eating a pancake and i started getting tingling all over i drank some hawaiian punch almost the same thing only i felt lightheaded i never had a problem with sugar before but i just wonder if its the medication i take paxil i have had glucose tests and they are normal but i just wonder if the medication is somehow messing my anxiety hmmmmm sugar is devils poop it is really bad for you i gradually tapered the sugar off started w no sugar in coffee then decreased and afterwards eliminated alcohol no soda no juice cut desert to one meal a week etc and i have to admit that it has had noticeable benefits reduced anxiety still heavy but not as intense increased concentration less foggy brain less depressed less fatigue the annoying part is that i feel much worse if i eat my favorite dessert but i also love it so i do eat my desert and suffer afterwards it is pretty silly its weird sugar never seemed to bother me but slowly it did i guess things just happen as strange as that sounds i do need to be less anxious so cutting out sugar is the best as my pdoc always said  along with caffeine even if im struggling to stay awake i miss my mountain dews though i sure do my therapist told me surgery foods increase anxiety and tension so avoid them as much as possible they told me to come back friday for a second interview so i think thats good i walked 8 miles today and cooked dinner for my family cleaned my room this is a good day i am not sure where it comes from and only this morning realised that these are linked to my anxietydepression but i sometimes have major rage outbursts i smash things up and shout and swear it can often seem like its over nothing for example someone looked at something in my work the other day and i thought they were judging me for putting it there so i went off in a rage shouting and swearing at the top of my lungs i later realised i had misjudged the situation and seriously overreacted previous times i have just felt unable to cope so thrown things and kicked stuff to smash them up like an uncontrollable kid having a tantrum usually noone is around but if there is they go silent and dont know what to do i think i scare people i know if my pet is around i scare them because they shake in their bed and wont come near me even though i am not shouting at them or hurting them in any way this makes me feel so bad and snap out of the outburst when i see them shaking and scared i dont want to do that to them i am already on meds for the anxiety attacks i used to get evety morning and this has helped a lot i am thinking of seeing my doc about this any advice i would discuss it with the doc maybe the meds are even bringing this on thanks but i have been having it since i was young and not on meds thanks for the response a family member of mine was said to have a rage disorder hed fly off the handle over anything i developed rage like you describe over one specific really big issue in my life id def discuss it with your doc though there are meds for it but i havent taken them hi i feel for you to be honest because the whole angerrage thing isnt really your fault its just the way it is for you but i have struggles along similar lines as well what i try to do is really stay aware of my emotions and feelings and watch what thoughts im latching onto and just try to let go of anything that might lead me toward an undesirable outburst scenario i havent perfected it but its definitely helping self awareness hang in there itsjustmehere its all a journey of inner growth have you tried anger management itsjustmehere hi all so i had a job interview today at a dog place the woman asked me reasons i wanted to work there besides dogs so i said to try and socialize more and she asked if i struggled with that i said well i can talk to people but it makes me a bit anxious sometimes then it got weird she proceeded to ask me things like are you taking any medications for that are you seeking professional help how long have you been seeing someone for it how long do you plan to is this why you need a certain time off each week does your therapist know you came here for this etc i answered out of pressure and being unsure of what to saydo but now i feel so violated she wrote it all down was this inappropriate or am i overreacting asking you how long you plan to see a therpist and pretty much all those other questions seem very odd to ask during an interview i cant say wether it was inappropriate or not but certainly unnecessary and uncomfortable i am socially shy and anxious at times and would personally be offended if she jumped straight to asking me if im getting help taking meds etc if i said i wanted the chance to improve my social skills i personally avoid talking about my social skills good or bad as much as possible at interviews because my fear that it would become problematic to tell a hiring manager that i have good social skills would be a lie they would come to realize later lol but to say i needed to work on it would make me feel that will give the employer some preconcieved notions about my socialability that would probably be wrong or even damaging to my chances because its not a black or white matter but some people treat it that way that being said being honest is not bad but there are sometimes implications to that kind of honestly wording is key to say you want to advance your social skills in the work place is good but i would avoid the word anxious or anxiety the last time i told a professional i had anxiety was at a blood donor place result had to get a written approval to donate from my therapist which i told her i did not see anymore and just quit taking the med i listed it was my last refill and was empty but it was still in my system since it was so recent so thats why i added it to my med list the nurse wouldnt listen i contacted the therapist and told her this and she said she would not do it since i dont actually take that med anymore i explained this to the nurse again and she refused to let me donate im pretty sure that was not really legal mind you my sister was with me and went in first with this nurse when she spoke with that nurse she told her she was taking that medication same as me too but did not mention anxiety to the woman like i did so she got to go right ahead and donate anyway i would say you or not overreacting the questions were way too much considering the original comment could be summed up to wanting more social opportunities lola5 dowdythefifth if you are in the us then all of those questions were illegal and you need to report it asking about medical questions which those qualify as and your treatment is very specifically illegal contact your local eeoc office and report her tell them you felt forced to answer or you wouldnt get the job you may want to consult with a lawyer also i cannot believe she asked those questions i have hired people before and you cannot ask those questions like no freaking way i cannot believe she asked you those questions so very illegal blatantly i would write it all down so you dont forget any of it right now and contact the eeoc office closest to you asap to file a complaint you have a pretty easy lawsuit there fyi seesaw yes those questions were way out of line at the same time i would never say im interested in a job to work on my social skills in an interview a job isnt therapy and if social skills are important for the job the employer wont want someone who says they want to improve those dp2017 definitely not okay the most she could have said and this still may not be appropriate thank you for being honest with me i hope you are addressing the issue and then move on with the interview on the other hand i have to ask did you do or say anything that could have triggered her to ask these questions in other words is there anything else that you didnt share in your post that we should know in order to evaluate the situation accordingly dp2017 jennifer 1967 her questions were definitely inappropriate but i hope this will serve as a lesson for future interviews to never answer with to socialize more in response to why you want to work somewhere remember you are not at work to socialize but to work i wish you all the best in future job interviews falldusktrain dp2017 88butterfly88 was feeling fairly relaxed yesterday evening woke up anxious sheesh already oh im so glad you both like this i think it is so great there are many other videos so far i really like repeating this one um ill say it again her questions were more than out of line they were illegal also her stance on refusing a service dog was illegal even though you dont have one i seriously would file a complaint with your regional eeoc office she is not allowed by law to ask you questions regarding your medical history nor to outright deny a service dog without considering a request for reasonable accommodation and making the case that it would cause her undue hardship i hope you will follow through with the complaint because she sounds like an abusive employer at the least if shes already breaking the law through her hiring practices seesaw justafriend306 seesaw this is from shrm the biggest resource on hr law since your medications have nothing to do with the position you were applying for like being a police officer or operating heavy machinery her inquiry violated the ada which does protect you here regardless if you are disabled or not here is a link describing such certainly these areas can be grey areas which is why you should file a complaint with the eeoc it does not cost anything file a complaint you do not need a lawyer to do so if the eeoc finds there was a violation then the employer would be fined employers break these rules all the time and i think its very important to report this stuff otherwise they continue to abuse people with disabilities seesaw her questions especially about medication were out of line and you could abd should time a complaint on a separate topic next time you could answer that you enjoy dogs and yuh are good with them so thats why you are looking for the job unless you are requesting accommodations you do not have to disclose anything about mental health or any other health you shouldnt have been asked those questions it is a good idea to report this person because if they have done it to you chances are they have gone and done this in the past or will do it to others in the future whether they meant well or claim they are being vigilant about the hiring process there are reasons why certain questions cannot be asked sito does anyone find that when you are feeling very anxious you get more done i find this myself when i may shake with fear at confronting certain situations but i am also very very productive at these times i guess there is a good side to anxiety my anxiety is especially high at the moment as i have been off my meds for a few days when people approach me and start a conversation i shake but these last few days i have really been stepping my work up a notch and organising my life in a very positive way i am confused as i dont know if this is good if i do physical labor i get more done with mental work not so much default management and coping skills for anxiety panic and ptsd here are some of the coping skills i learned for managing anxiety and found to work well for stress and ptsd i hope you find some of them useful  i have posted these before but am bringing them together and up to date and adding the dbt selfsoothing skills that also help either before or after a panic self comforting skills we are social creatures but getting what we need when we need it from another is not always available here are some of the suggestions from the dbt handbook on self soothing skills think of soothing each of your five senses 1 vision notice what you see find soothing things to look at i go to a blog that has lovely pictures c ptsd  a way out  a place to check in daily  2 hearing pay attention to what you can hear around you put on your favorite music 3 smell be aware of the memories that smell can bring i like to do aroma therapy there are many essential oils for that 4 taste carefully savor flavors that the day brings you keep a favorite hard candy on hand for the little sugar boost too 5 touch find comfort in touch keep a special pillow or blanket with a favorite perfume on it dialectical behavioral therapydistress tolerance skillsselfsoothing  wikibooks open books for an open world these are not listed but i find them handy too a reassurance tell yourself that you are ok safe and unharmed the danger is past you have survived this before and now you are stronger and more skillful than then b take action go for a walk or exercise or clean house or cook use your bodys natural focusing powers to leave the fear behind c refocus think about pleasant things push the hurtful thoughts away have a hobby or a story or a book that you like to take your mind to a better place coping with anxiety and panic 1 remember feelings of panic are just exaggerations of normal bodily stress reactions 2 sensations are neither harmful nor dangerous  just unpleasant nothing worse will happen 3 anxiety is temporary instead of fighting it relax into it just let it be 4 focus on facing the fear rather than trying to avoid it or escape from it 5 stop adding to the panic with frightening thoughts of where panic will lead 6 stay in the present be aware of what is happening to you rather than concern yourself with how much worse it might get 7 notice that when you stop adding to panic with frightening thoughts the fear begins to fade 8 wait and give the fear time to pass 9 look around you plan what you will do next as the panic subsides 10 when you are ready to go on do so in an easy relaxed manner there is no hurry 11 think about the progress made so far despite all the difficulties some specific actions 1 manage your breathing if it is rapid breathe into a paper sack to lower oxygen uptake 2 count your breaths 1001 1002 1003 ect up to 1020 then start again slow down the count to slow your heartbeat counting interferes with anxiety 3 delay doing anything about your anxiety or panic just follow the steps and focus on getting thru it 4 distract yourself with anything that requires you to focus and is simple and handy  at home you might read something easy like a magazine or knit or wash dishes whatever engages your attention 5 eat something to replenish the blood sugars that adrenalin has burned up and give yourself at least 15 minutes for the kidneys to clean out the ashes in your blood 6 write these things down and keep them with you until you have made them a habit practice these skills before you need them or when you are just mildly anxious so they will be familiar when you are feeling very upset i hope you find this information helpful best wishes gus this is a good thread and would probably benifit from being a sticky here i dont actually know if we have a sticky in the anxiety section for methods someone told me recently that one way to help with anxiety is to suck on a humbug not suck on a sweet it has to be a humbug why i dont know but i tried this and it did work to help calm a panic attack i was having so now i ordered a huge bag full i just got the email today of my orientation date for an internship i applied for i have had a real problem with this all my life i will decide i want to do something a job volunteer school etc and back out at the last minute or worse quit midday and escape home i remember when i was like 7 years old i wanted to do gymnastics so bad i begged my mom to sign me up for it and she somehow managed to scrape together some money when i got there i went into the gym and freaked at the sight of all the kids bouncing around having fun i went and hid in the bathroom my mom had not even left yet and then i proceeded to beg her to take me home she was so mad and confused at my behavior i have managed to push myself to do some things but when i wanted to join ballet i was already 14 years old and felt much more comfortable in the adult class and that was how i was able to ease into that i did that for 10 years despite being self conscious about my body i even worked there for free lessons i did quit a few times though but returned after a few months break ive done this with a job i felt particularly comfortable with too i had gone through the horrible discomfort of starting that job but often felt like i could do something more so in a depressed and anxious mood i wouldnt go into work they would take me back 6 months later probably because it was retail and i was a good employee except for my little episodes they took me back 3 times over 7 years i finally quit for good 6 years ago and tried 2 other jobs one where i worked at home i ended up going back to school and only finished because it was online then i felt really ambitious and decided it would be a good idea to apply for a 3 month internship where i will go from no job at all to working 40 hours a week doing very physical labor getting up at 530am and having a long commute i have been so isolated out of shape and have really poor sleeping habits this feels like my last chance at having some sort of life im already midthirties with no kids never married i need something in my life but am too scared to go through with this the extreme shift in routine will be a shock to me and i dont know if ill be able to handle it i feel like i will blow this opportunity and am kicking myself that i didnt apply for something more pt first will i ever learn not to ignore my limits i dont want to burn bridges at this place because my plan for years was to eventually work there actually i have oscillated about really wanting this as a career too maybe because of the anxiety but maybe because of something else i dont know i have already started thinking of excuses to back out though i have 2 weeks to mull this over until it will probably turn into nothingness once again and i will be back where i started oh and the financial mess this behavior has left is growing as well even though i was lucky in a way to inherit a little money when my dad died i now have a giant student loan so really cant mess around anymore it has also done a number on my self esteem and dignity i cant count the times ive done this too and like you wasted a lot of money in the process i remember the last time i was so stuck for excuses i just came up with well it was rainingg so i couldnt do it it was inside so like that worked hugs orbit i dont know if you meant to do it but i laughed a little your response was kind of funny thank you i needed that at least you have a sense of humor over it usually i do too but get so wrapped up the feelings sometimes shattered sanity just take each day at a time only you know your limits if you truly cant handle the work or find yourself getting then quit or maybe work out a part time opportunity with the same company ive learned that if you dont ask you never know what people will say good luck thanks for sharing this it is interesting how caught up we can become in tv programs i was severely bullied throughout high school and to this day i have great difficulty watching any program that involves someone being bullied or threatened in any way programs that involve hostagetaking are an absolute dontwatch for me on the other hand one of the things ive struggled with my entire life is gender identity disorder theres one program in the inspector lewis series shown on our local public television station that concerns a character who was a maletofemale transsexual as it turns out that character is the villain in the program still i love watching that segment every time it is replayed i dont want to leave the house i dont even want to leave my room i just want to stay here wrapped up in a blanket well im about to quit after 2 days in i am so weird and so tired of myself there are some people who might be considered weird right away but i appear normal to most people when they first meet me in fact i can even appear quite confident my problem is that once i am expected to loosen up after introductions or whatever i get real quiet people must think i am stuck up or dont like them or something no i am just really self conscious i dont know what to say the first day is fine because i can ask questions but when it comes to the little banter and joking around i just dont find it funny but get so exhausted fake laughing or smiling of course i do it though to be polite then people start talking about their husband or kids or vacations i just cant relate i am a weirdo who never got married or had kids and have always been too poor to travel i also didnt go straight from high school to college i went on and off for years trying different things it doesnt look good i wish i could just say that and then add that i only settle for inconsiderate guys who dont care about me at least i wouldnt have to fake being normal i cant even stand it anymore isnt there anyone like me im starting to think i have some sort of disorder where i am two different people one day i like certain things and the next day i am indifferent to the same thing my mood is usually different too and it is totally uncontrollable there doesnt seem to be anything that can bring me out of the mood ive been seeing a therapist in training and when i mentioned this to her she sort of ignored it i feel like im probably one of those people who need a different kind of help but am slipping through the cracks then that just confirms my thoughts about being too worthless for any therapist or doctor to care about i swear i just dont know why people go into certain professions no one seems to really care it just seems like they had to pick something as a career and are fulfilling their own selfish ambitions instead of genuinely wanting to help having horrible thoughts today i dont know anymore ok so its been a while since ive been on herein the past few months ive experienced my verbally and sometimes physical abusive sister having a baby moving out  a failed relationship

them may be of some help with putting your own experiences to rest thanks for the links and support so i need to quit my job ive been back and forth on this for months i feel a lot of guilt over quitting at the same time i dread my job every day i dont enjoy it anymore its too timeconsuming and i cant devote enough time to myself or to school i have an hour long commute and i hate it i never get enough sleep im exhausted and just done the thing is im basically a babysitter i get to the house in the early am get the kids ready for school then take them to school i have a brief break while theyre there during which time i go back to their empty house too long a commute to go back to my own then i pick them up from school and keep them until the end of their single moms workday used to be they would come home and take a nap and i could do homework now though one of themnis in therapy every day after school so we drive 45 minutes to therapy sit there for 2 hours and drive 45 minutes back coupled with my commute a lot of driving the mom also got them a puppy for xmas which she wants me to take care of while the kids are in school im allergic to the pup so thats frustrating the mom has also been getting home later and later until my workday has consistently stretched more than an hour longer each day i need a bit of a break and im looking for workfromhome jobs the thing is i have so much anxiety over quitting i mean shes a single mom one of her kids just started therapy ive been teaching the other to read they just got a puppy shes been having a hard time at work ive been with them over a year my initial agreement with her was to work for her for a year the second that year was up she started begging me not to quit she raised my pay by a dollar an hour i feel like shes done as much as she can to keep me but i just dont want to be here anymore but im scared to tell her ugh i just got my degree and im in graduate school now i want work experience that isnt babysitting im super terrified of confrontation though any advice would help well i dont know as there is much of anything in the way of advice i can offer from my perspective this is just one of those situations that is what it is yes it may be difficult for the mom when you leave but you dont owe her your life your circumstances have changed  its time to for you to move on thats it there shouldnt be any confrontation involved with this but of course what there should be  what there will be may be two different things i think all you can do is to tell your employer straight out your circumstances have changed  its time for you to move on try to give her a reasonable amount of notice if you feel you can so that she can do whatever she needs to do to find someone to replace you but beyond that you have your own life to live and its become time for you to get on with it youre right and i can hear the rationality of it but theres a major part of my brain that is terrified of anyone being angry or upset with me i seriously cant deal with it a friend once texted me we need to talk mutual friend is mad at you and i got so panicked about it that i vomited im so scared of telling this mom that i want to quit that i start shaking whenever i think of it and every time she makes a little comment about not wanting me to quit or that i should leave grad school and just be her nanny or whatever i get nauseous its really intense anxiety the weird thing is in situations like this im inclined to lie it feels like if i tell a story to justify my quitting likejake and i are pregnant he wants me to stay home anything to deflect from the fact that i simply want to quit its easier to take it if they get upset because i know theyre mad at something that isnt even true not at just me im usually a very honest person its only in this type of very specific situation that i suddenly cant deal with it and feel the urge to lie its very strange i know this is probably weird but i have mild anxiety about female contestants going on quiz shows it usually works out something like this ill watch the introduction of the quiz show and see who the contestants are then if theirs a female contestant on the show either ill turn off the quiz and watch something else or on a good day ill keep it on in the background but do something else i dont know why this is and its not always last week their was a female contestant on the chase and i was able to watch that without turning it off i have also watched female contestants play a detective quiz i like but on high anxiety days i just cant cope with females on quiz shows i even panic smallbluefish shattered sanity i had a pretty big win against my anxiety over the weekend i am good i am happy to hear you turn off the show you have indicated a problem with female contestants and your comfort zone i wonder if you also have a problem with quiz shows themselves can you find an alternative just dont watch them in the first place i have my own problem with any kind of reality tv programming i just cant bear to see people behave badly and humiliate themselves publicly so i dont even try to watch them i turn the tv off instead shattered sanity shattered sanity i did it again this week and you know what was sad i really wanted to watch it new quiz called the wave where teams of 2 have to work together to try and win thousands of pounds the presenter announced so today their is a mother and daughter playing the game and i turned it off ugg and i wanted to see it too its okay the following night i tuned in to the wave again and the couple were males so could watch it this is an anxiety that has plagued me since early childhood and i think that it dates back to the first grade when i was in the first grade there was a girl in my class that i was very visually attracted to i put it that way because i basically knew nothing about her other than that she was very pretty to my child eyes so like any little kid with a crush i started writing love letters to her but after reading them she would look right at me and tear them up the emotional pain from that was overwhelming to me even as a young child to make matters worse she later began to bully me by popping me with her comb that was emotionally painful too i dont know which stung worse the comb on my tender flesh or the sting of persecution to my heart even so i continued to want her to be my girlfriend but knew deep inside that that would never happen eventually my family packed up and moved to south carolina and for a long time i had no interest in other girls as i still dreamed of that one eventually in time i began to forget about her and just let it go but my interests in other girls didnt start up again until maybe the fith or sixth grade and this was for yet another who didnt return my affections and seemed to resent me the next year it was the same thing with a different girl and again the year after that i believe that after that was when i truly gave up oh sure as a teenager i still fancied other girls throughout jr high school but dared not approach them save for one who was really cool but we would just talk on the bus as she wasnt in any of my classes but i could never work up the nerve to try to take it any further than that by saying something complimentary like hey ashley youre really pretty you know that or ashley youre so cool so by that point in life or really by the sixth grade i could no longer tell pretty girls what i thought of them and i am still intimidated by attractive women to this day even when i do work up the nerve to talk to one which is very rarely i screw it up by not thinking it through enough first and when it doesnt work out i become super depressed and anxious about having no future that really matters and go buy some beer to calm my nerves even though i dont drink that much after that i feel a little better but still hurt inside so that is one of my biggest if not the biggest anxiety that i have i didnt mean for this post to be so long i guess i just had to get this off of my chest as it has tormented me for many years im so sorry youve had these experiences you are very strong as you havent given up yet have you considered processing some of this in therapy or through journaling sending big hugs mavriforcek9r hi all i am starburstowl26 and i have been having a lot of anxiety like a lot i am on a med to treat it but i find myself taking it every single day new years eve was super hard for me because i dont like loud noises i took my medicine but i still had a small panic attack when the grand finale went off at midnight also having a hard time going to stores anymore because i start practically hyperventilating the second i step out of the car i havent had anxiety issues this bad since i was like 17 and i am 28 now i have no clue what triggered it either i had a hysterectomy in august that brought on a depression but cant seem to figure out where the anxiety is coming from sigh well anxiety is certainly something ive been familiar with for many years decades really i dont know as i can really offer much in the way of insight as far as why or how it develops but here are links to a couple of articles from psychcentrals archives on the subject rdgrad15 sorry youre struggling had a hysterectomy too was so surprised when the dr said it could be a year before all the hormones stablized had a horrible time eventually had to go on hrt thankfully my female dr had gone thru the same problems  knew they werent psychological but physical has anyone ever been to a residential program for anxiety or know someone who has did it work what was it like i have bad anxiety when someone is angry or shouts this is becoming a problem as soon as someone gets angry it doesnt have to be at me i am anxious of them and refuse to have anything more to do with them and im very anxious around them at first i thought this was because of my history of childhood abuse but now i dont think so i think it goes beyond that and i know i need to stop this we all get angry from time to time and if i got anxious of every single person who ever got angry theird be no one left i actually have not been to one i talked to my therapist about it and he says that for anxiety residential programs dont really do any good because after the person leaves treatment then they still have to face whatever anxiety they were facing before treatment calm thank you for sharing this i feel this way too i definitely avoid confrontation and will sometimes act more cheerful just to avoid the possibility of confrontation although youre right that we all get angry from time to time it sounds like you also want a gentler world am i reading right if so i think what youre saying totally makes sense and that theres nothing wrong with your response sending good wishes for a gentle day today lola5 im the exact same way but i think does have to do with my childhood every time somebody was angry when i was little it lead to physical violence so i always get scared thats going to happen i avoid arguing as much as possible and cant stand to see fights happen i always want to run and hide i am the same way i strongly dislike myself for being like a spunge even if someone is doing an anxious or an angry facial tic or expression i feel it in my stomach annoying same goes for angry emails news articles online comments my brain exaggerates them i get really scared and immediately get anxiety my only coping mechanism has been to ignore and escape which probably is not the wisest way to deal with the situation well i also go to therapy for the reasons that make my brain react that way but it has not really helped this is very much a trigger for my ptsd im sorry you are having this difficulty i have this challenge in certain situations and it causes panic attacks so bad i cant begin to address the situation have you thought about processing this with a therapist sending big hugs i know mine comes from childhood abuse there are better ways to get ones point across besides shouting though its mostly conditioning my daughters boyfriends family tends to shout a lot at each other but i saw them at thanksgiving and it wasnt too bad i think they were probably forewarned the one that does it the most hid in the home office most of the time starryprince yeah me too  cant cope with raised voices or people not liking me shattered sanity i was wondering if anybody has problems with physical symptoms of anxiety after illnesses like the flu or colds all the time i have health anxiety so i always worry that something is worse than what it is im reassured that its nothing but my anxiety and nothing is physically wrong with me absolutely i am pretty much over a stomach bug but i am struggling to go back to eating normal foods because i have bad emetophobia fear of vomiting baby steps i suppose can any of you share what trickstools you use to distract your ruminating thoughts im having a bit of a struggle with mine ive been reading some things online and came across some things that resonated with me the less we fight against that which is disturbing us the less disturbing these experiences become the fear of experiencing significant anxietydepression  emotional phobia we feel bad for feeling bad what works for you when you start to ruminate anyone else have to deal with this i used to be very confused by it even though i know its pretty common because my job is very low stress and i like my coworkers but i think its just dreading having so little time for myself and feeling like i didnt do everything i had planned on doing on the weekend both chores and fun stuff ive been wanting to go ice skating for the past 6 weekends but id have to go at 9 am because later theres too many kids on the ice and its chaos i feel like theres way too much on my to do list and i dont have much energy to do stuff after work plus i have yoga once or twice a week and class once after work the other two nights i have to do grocery shopping and cook for two days basically im already looking forward to friday and the upcoming week being over when it hasnt even started yet  the biggest problem with that is that i dont sleep very well on sunday night and then i start the week being exhausted and because i have to get up extra early on monday morning i feel like any time i take to relax stresses me more because i should be in bed already i have an early morning anyone have any tips well i dont know as i have any particularly useful tips to offer im pretty sure anything i could think of you already know about but i can certainly relate to what you wrote without going into a lot of detail ill just say that for many years decades really sunday night anxiety was something that haunted me im a senior citizen now and i havent been employed for quite a few years but i still feel some remnants of that old sunday night anxiety i think after so many years of it its so ingrained i still cant quite let it all go feeling anxiety today over a few things progressed to a panic attack drastically reduced my benzodiazepines at my own request wondering if that is causing the problem or if im just expecting too much out of myself whatever it is i really dislike it one thing i do is to practice compassionate abiding in case youre not familiar with this practice heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice the other thing i do is ive learned a few mantras and when i begin to ruminate  find im having difficulty stopping ill chant these mantras theyre all in languages i dont speak  personally i find that to be a plus if youre not familiar with mantras youtube is a great place to find many thanks skeesyks i read that link from a post where you recommended it to someone else thats where the quotes i posted were from my worst times are early morning sometimes an hour or two before i need to get up then i worry the whole day will go that way ugh ill youtube mantras thanks anxiety here too this was once a problem cbt helped a great deal one thing i find makes it worse is to write about my thoughts no journalling no blogging i hear you the sunday blues are very real i start getting that feeling of dread around 3pm on sunday i read somewhere that it helps to have something fun planned on sunday like working out going to the movies etc that way you have something to look forward to instead of just focusing on the upcoming week i always say ill do that then never follow through if anything i spend sunday preparing like doing laundry grocery shopping checking my work schedule blech hugs to you all i am more afraid that people will abuse me rather than the people themselves the first question i ask myself when i meet someone new is will this person be abusive towards me thats what happens when youve had a ed up childhood a therapist one time told me that when i found myself ruminating to just say stop works better when i am alone or in a car i am also keeping track by the hour whether anything i fear has happened so far for about 5 days i only had one hour where my fear and it was not a serious one came true i am beginning to see that i am wasting a lot of time worrying i distract myself with hobbies video games movies anything superhero find a go to hobby and do it when the thoughts start circulating about in your head i have anxiety dropping or picking up my kid from school  i can take the kid to stores and stuff without much frightanyone else feel this did you feel anxiety going to school when you were a kid when i see kids waiting for a school bus i feel a little anxious i think i relate it to my childhood and fear i had around going to school at times and trouble i experienced riding the bus pinkvilla i was just wondering if anyone could help me with a dilemma i am having i want to start journalling ive noticed recently that my state of mind can alter dramatically throughout the day from the depths of despair to being ok i also have times when i have thoughts  or at least i think they are thoughts  but which at the time i think are real  then later when im trying to recall those thoughts or whatever they are and i cant anyway i keep thinking  particularly when im feeling bad  that i should go  see my gp but by the time i get an appointment even if its the same day i will probably feel better  either cancel or not be able to explain myself because of all of the above i thought that journalling would help me capture how im feeling in that moment  then i could take it with me to my gp the issue im having i dont know how to keep my journal if i keep it on paper format i live in fear of it being discovered  read by my family  if its going to work i need to be honest in what i write i dont want them to see it if i keep it on the notes section of my phone which feels like the safest place  im afraid of the data being lost  i dont know whether the gp will find it as easy to read all of this is bothering me  i feel mithered  undecided  then i become anxious just typing this is giving me palpitations im having the same issue with lists im trying write a to do list but i want it in a format that i can keep with the date next to the items as i do them so i can see how much or how little im accomplishing so it needs to be in a book or a pad where the pages dont come outand then i cant decide whether the things to do should be on the same page or in the same book as things to buy  what about my aims for 2018 should they have a separate page or book if i do them separately i end up with multiple books or parts of a book to keep checking  looking at  keep safe  again it just all becomes overwhelming im eally struggling with any kind of motivation to do anything at the moment i find no joy in anything i cant seem to think of anything i actually want to do so i just keep doing things other people are doing in the hopeactually i dont knowin the hope that ill stop feeling so lost sorry this post has kind of morphed im not even sure its in the right forum now desperation any help at all would be most appreciated thank you sounds like its sorta like journalling a dream by the time you wake up to write it down you forget what the dream is about is it possible it just write down some general notes with dates and times and later that date go back and rewrite more in detail maybe time consuming but could work use an online journal thank you both for taking the time to reply i hadnt thought about just doing some brief notes i will try that maybe it will be enough to jog my memory thank you and as daft as this may sound i didnt know there were such things as online journals thank you that could work i feel a bit calmer today sometimes i read my original posts  its like a different person has written them which i guess comes from the rapid changes in how i feel during anyone day thank you have you been journaling how has it been going some people keep a day book with everything in one bookthoughtsideasgoalslists sounds messy but i may try it because i have too many separate books to keep track of and its a pain if you keep a hard copy journal only use initials or even your own code names so if it is found others wont find it so interesting most people dont care about reading someones journal unless they are in it i always disguise people places and events so that i can carry a proper journal i think now i may start a day book good luck thanks for the word mitheredi never heard of it and so had to look it up its a great word seesaw online journalling is great livejournal especially is a really good service that allows you to customise your journal plus their are applications for it you can download so you dont have to visit the website shattered sanity abladeinthemeadow abladeinthemeadow dechandawa i wanted to add this tipi perk up my journals by pasting in photos and cutouts i use stickers sometimes i draw in them i did this in order to be a little more creativeand when i go back to old journals it is fun to see art work and poetry etc i also record quotes that i like from other sources things to help me in my journey thats where im at i think i dont want a diary i want to record my feelings  thought processes which i can never recall after the event in the hope as you have to gain some kind of insight  understanding of myself how you describe your workbooks makes perfect sense to me and if we invent some words along the way all the better i love the idea of adding pictures  quotes when im low i quite often spend a ridiculous amount of time searching quotes on the internet there is often a picture or a quote that captures what im trying to verbalise and cant thats a great idea  will really help with getting a true picture of that day or time from one journaler to another  thank you dechandawa abladeinthemeadow my best friend in middlehigh school did that i witnessed it a few times at slumber parties we talked about it many years later we all thought she was faking to try to freak us out or to be funny no it was real she has dissociative disorder and ptsd i really cant say what happened to her because it is too triggering of course you should see a therapist and psychiatrist to diagnose your symptoms hi i have bpii i have had gad in the past but dont really have too many problems with that anymore that said i got overly exhausted in middecember with being sick and work and a lot of responsibilities and not enough sleep i boarded a flight to visit my family for xmast very early in the morning totally exhausted i had to transfer flights and on my second flight i almost nodded off but jolted awake suddenly before the plane took off and i had this feeling of being unable to access myself being separate from myself it was the most unsettling thing i have ever experienced it wouldnt go away i tried breathing exercises putting my head down closing my eyes nothing helped nothing would shake the feeling that something wasnt right that i was outside of myself in a way finally i got out of my seat to get a klonopin out of my bag i have them in case i need them but hardly ever take them i chewed it to make it work faster and fell asleep when i awoke the feeling was gone the next day i had another episode like that while in the shower it lasted the rest of the day and made me very anxious but was less intense than the one i had on the plane what is this is it panic shattered sanity dowdythefifth well im certainly no expert but based on what you wrote i would say yes this certainly sounds to me like a panic attack here are links to 6 articles from psychcentrals archives on the subject of panic attacks i think pretty much every parents worse fear is something happening to their child i know i will never rid myself of that fear but im struggling with it these days i have one child an 18 month old daughter after i gave birth i developed a really bad fear she would die from sids i got a breathing monitor and it really helped until she was older and past the sids danger zones i dont let my fear get in the way of living our lives i let her go to daycare i let my mom babysit her etc but those intrusive thoughts come into my mind numerous times a day where i worry about having to live my life without her in it what if we get in a car accident what if my mom is taking care of her and she takes off and gets hit by a car sometimes the thoughts just pop in when im driving and i visualize in my mind her running out on the road and getting hit by a car its not minor things i worry about its death i have always struggled with a fear of deathfor both myself and those i love i used to have the same fears with my dog and had the same intrusive thoughts aside from anxiety i have boarderline personality disorder and i think its part of the fear of abandonment or something i have asked it in here as it feels more like anxiety i am not on medication anymore and i dont see a therapist right now i need to get this under control though my mom wants to take my daughter one day during the week to visit my brothers family and its a lot of freeway driving to get there why does my brain instantly go to them getting in a catastrophic accident or my daughter running off and my mom not being able to catch her if i heard someone else worrying like this id think they are crazy are there any books or resources on this anyone have any techniques in how to deal with it i try to recognize the thoughts name them and say how they are making me feel but it just doesnt seem to get better thank you im sorry you are struggling with these difficult thoughts i cant be of any help with regard to books however here are links to some articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of interest family therapist kati morton has a video on her youtube channel on the topic of intrusive thoughts perhaps there is something in this video that can be of help as well heres a link there is also a practice that is referred to as compassionate abiding that may be of some benefit heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice best wishes hello my anxiety has been getting worse to the point where i feel like an emotional wreck right now its so stressful worrying that something will go wrong all of the time and it sucks being anxious 247 because i just want some relief my next psychiatrist appointment is on november 16th and it just seems so far away i want to be better i think its a common fear amped up i have had many times when this came up about either my daughter or my husband what will i do if this happened catastrophic thinking abounds surprisingly enough i just follow the whole scenario throughwhat i would do afterwards how would i feel etc after enough times of doing this i dont feel as anxious i know what i would do and its okay i feel im prepared enough though one never really is and i can handle it with help you may want to explore this with a therapist my children are grown adults now but i still experience vivid intrusive thoughts about their safety when i say vivid i mean horrific i also regularly get dreams of the same when my son lived several neighbourhoods over anytime i heard sirens i had a vivid picture in my head of something awful happening to him and held vigil over the phone just in case it took the ybocs checklist of obsessive compulsive thinking and there are statements pertaining to this  which surprised me as i pretty much assumed ocd was about cleanliness and order before then thank you for your replies sorry it took me so long to say thanks  life is hectic these days i really appreciate you guys taking the time to reply and for putting those links thanks again can you tell im canadianlol you guys my brain just shuts off when im around people im not comfortable withmost people fr its crazy and i hate it its really messing with my life anybody have any advice its really getting to me its tough to struggle with that one thing that helped me is to focus less on how i feel and more on what i am trying to accomplish and what they might be feeling for example in walking up to a cashier i focus on paying for what i am buying and try to be thoughtful to them because they are probably tired from being on their feet all day when you focus on those two things and do your best to ignore the rest it should help you get through it easier it also helps to put yourself in the situation over and overeven if it isnt comfortable and allow yourself to make mistakes without criticizing yourself it gives you the chance to build on what isnt working each time you try it may help to observe the people you are around and how they conduct themselves ive said this to others before watch people around you interact learn their non verbal cues and learn what seems to work and not work adapt then your own manner of contact you might find that if it were to be less strained then you would find such situations less irritating and possibly even enjoyable i get uncomfortable too and some types of people are really hard for me to be around but i actually practise such situations  yes i rehearse conversations hi guys does anyone have any helpful tips on coping with flight anxiety i am flying tomorrow and i am starting to get really nervous i fly regularly as i have to keep up with family its a short 3 hour flight and ive been flying for around 5 years 34 times a year i was fine in the beginning i loved my first flight but in the last year ive started to feel terrible in the plane and before the flight i was so horrified the last time we flew i cried in my boyfriends arms when we felt a bit of turbulence i tried breathing exercises and distracting myself with readingcolouring but every time i feel a bit of shaking i stop doing whatever im doing and i just start to look around and notice whats happening when the turbulence stops i continue to read and everything is fine i really want to overcome this as i feel like a complete nervous wreck ball and i hate that i dont know if ive got the strength to overcome this and if i do have it how to find it in myself and put it to good use any tips are greatly appreciated thank you hello lamb i see this is your first post here on pc so

hi i love coffee but it does up my anxiety and insomnia even an am cup only more some times than others when i gotta get off coffee gunpowder greentea is a good substitute im not as mentally keen on it but it does clear my head with more of a chill vibe and it fends off headache and i think it curbs appetite more than coffee though i drink more cups of it than i do coffee i can drink gunpowder all morning to midday without stressing from it i wish i could quit drinking coffee no doubt about that coffeine is increasing my anxiety but  i cant help it  im addicted and i like everything about coffee energy boost the smell the warmth of the cup in my hands and sharing it with family and friends going to a rather lavish haunted house with friends tonight the funny thing is i wish these types of things were actually scarycreepy i like being creeped out and getting goosebumps by suggestive subtle or spooky horror but the overthetop jump scares and prosthetic gore create a mixture of boredom and stress for me just waiting for the guy with a chainsaw to pop out of nowhere is not terribly fun or exhilarating still gotta be a good friend even though id rather spend my friday night at home in my pjs slobbing about if something happened on your flight the thing you need to remember is that the cabin crew are prepared for it and they know what to do if it happens you know the safety demonstrations at the start of flights well thats why they exist so the crew can tell the passengers what they could do if something went wrong and thats why they insist all passengers stop what they are doing to give it full attention the chances of something happening on your flight are very very small think about all the flights every day taking off from airports that land successfully at their destination then think of those flights how many do we hear about that have crashed most of the time plains crash because they are either flying through dangerous space for example above a war zone or something unexpected happens with the weather while you are in the air but then pilots will do their best to land at another closer airport turbulence is nothing to be scared of turbulence is like really strong wind that shakes the plain a little bit many many successfull flights pass through turbulence in fact i think i can say with some confidence that the majority of flights deal with some turbulence anyway its a scary part of the flight like your ears popping but a normal part good luck my therapist lmft suggested videos on meditation  didnt help me  but maybe you ive found that i am far more relaxed on a plane when im completely exhausted  but thats probably not the best solution worked great for me this morning though and because i was running a bit late i was more worried over will i make my flight instead of being anxious over the flight itself and there was a huge relief when i did make my flight thank you all for your replies the flight was fine in the end it was very windy when we were landing and the plane shook quite a lot but the most important thing is it landed safely i am getting really tired of feeling that way and not being able to deal with my anxiety i guess after a few more flights i will be completely fed up with my anxiety and stop allowing it to overcome me ive decided in no way i will let this prevent me from seeing my familythe world of course i say this now when my next flight is a few months away ill probably feel differently the day before the flight thank you all again for your time im so glad your flight was okay good for you for actually doing it hugs i am constantly worry about the world ending or how i would die it has pretty much taken over my life i cant sleep and if i do i am having nightmares because of this phobia  shattered sanity i have that fear too i also worry that anyone from my close family is going to die and how painful it will be my worry is so big i sometimes find it difficult to sleep especially when ive had an exhausting day in my experience thinking that dying and family members passing away happens to absolutely everyone no exceptions helps everyone has to deal with death at some point so the only thing we can do is live our life and not worry about it its going to happen sooner or later so whats the point of worrying about it just variations of panic attacks pretty severe though do you see a mental health professional are you taking any medication for anxietypanic disorder when panic attacks are so severe that they interrupt school you need to see someone i was thinking about this fear literally for hours before i even saw this post up until now so it really jumped out as something i can relate to completely this fear somehow became strong around september but i have also experienced this at age 15 where i became fixated on feeling that i was going to die soon now i am afraid of dying in my sleep and think about it every night it has made it worse that my former boyfriend died recently and my best friend died of cancer and i am quite young to know two people who were closest to me pass away i obsess over fear of family dying too lately i think i became obsessed with control i am supposed to be asleep now but i am not out of fear something that i fixate on lately is the risk of my medications causing cardiac problems and thinking something will happen to me if i go to sleep nothing seems to be helping my heart is racing i am sorry that you are struggling this too i wish i had solutions but i am trying to use coping skills to try to relax and forget about the fear if you are in therapy hopefully that can help i am starting to go for other reasons but i am beginning to talk about it i am hoping it will help at least a little bit the more i avoid thinking about all this the better i think about that too when i am not feeling physically well the only thing i do is practice self care even if it feels odd i have also tried some exercise running on a rebounder as a therapist once suggested that sometimes that tricks the flight or fight part of the brain in to thinking i am running away from the danger and thus helping to quell some of those panic brain chemicals i also know that feeling that way keeps me from enjoying those i love and life just sometimes the thoughts tend to get a life of their own i am constantly worry about the world would end i would not be able to live my life before that happen i dont care what anyone says ive come to the conclusion that no one is taking away my meager 1 cup of coffee a day ill use 1 tea spoon from now on of coffee to make that cup which i believe is quite moderate thank you for sharing your experiences everyone it helped me make my mind my anxiety has been through the roof i know some of it is financial stuff mostly being unwise and some of it about finding a new home for my dog i cant get it to calm down want to give in to the urge to majorly restrict i try not to stress the stress hi jessharp im feeling for you hope this isnt horribly lame but sometimes i think of my finances as a video game i remember that money is not really real and it helps me hope it helps you what kind of dog do you have do you have any friends who could look after it or could you take your dog to a centre so they can find it a nice home i cant watch the commercials about animal abuse on animal planet i always change the channel when they come on bozdickens shattered sanity verity81 content note mentions of depression mentions of anxiety around deathillness of others not detailed lately ive been having some good days good as in i feel like im feeling supported or ive worked through some things with my t etc but one thing ive noticed about my good days is that it often comes with the fear of crashing and returning to one of my bad days for example ill have a good day because im feeling supported by my friends even though im struggling ill think about how grateful i am for my good daybut then ill suddenly get anxious about something awful happening to my friends like illness death accidents etc then i either spend the rest of my day being anxioussad good day ruined or i continue on but now carrying the fear of crashing into a bad day again part of me feels like i shouldnt be dividing myself into good and bad days anyway but sometimes i do wish i could have one good day without fear does anyone else experience something similar how do you usually work through this fear of crashing hope this all makes sense i think we all or at least most of us have this experience to one extent or another i certainly do my allpurpose remedy for intrusive thoughts as well as anxiety fear  other disturbing emotions is a technique referred to as compassionate abiding perhaps youre familiar with it if not heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice may it be of benefit thanks for this skeezyks the link is really helpfulive heard about this kind of mindfulness in various capacities but its hard to find one this accessible i appreciate it i can relate to this so much ive had several times when everything felt good ive had one of those good days or nights and ill feel like something bad will happen one time i went to a dance at my college campus and it was a great night the music was great and energetic the people were awesome and there was a lot of positive energy in the room but later that night there was a feeling of doom that something bad would happen that feeling sucks even when i felt that something bad would happen nothing bad really happened so it really shows me that anxiety is an illusion anxiety gives the illusion of doom and terror but it is really just a feeling my anxiety goes up and down i wish i could manage it properly but things seem to get in the way i think talking to someone may help but dont feel alone because i have experienced this on many occasions smallbluefish okay so i really want therapy i have the means to get therapy however just the thought of it makes me want to cry scream and panic any suggestions bad storms now i hate them i get such anxiety hello welp i see this is your

members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting dont go to the wrong therapist  follow the advice here to know which one  otherwise its the police and suicide im getting that tired feelinghard to stand up thing i get from anxiety im going to get up now and go shopping anyway we need food i will log on and work a little tonight that should help im worried about work hi welp 36  all that skeezyks suggested was great  so follow that i will also add that after being so depressed last june following that 12th  2nd years passing of my parents  i just did not care  i was never suicidal  i just lost interest in anything so i sought out help after watching a few kati morton videos  and after a free consultation i was refereed to someone i could afford  and i have been in therapy since the 2nd week of aug so here is the honest truth your therapist is there to help you  but you must want that help there are times when you will feel you must say something in order to feel better  and after end up feeling either better or worse  it is ok  that is how therapy works the most important thing to remember is tell your therapist everything  every gory detail  the more your therapist knows the more effective your therapy will be holding something back is not a good idea  i have tried out of fear  but have found that once i found the courage to say what i needed to say  i was ok  even better that ok there will be times when you tell your t something and it will get you thinking  sometimes thinking is scary and sometimes it hurts but at your next app tell you t what you felt the day after you got something off your mind your t is there to sort out the mess  not make things worst at times you will laugh while other times you might be sad  but in the end you will be whole and go on to do great things with your new life i guess that really sums it up  your new life whatever is bothering you now  once you work through it  you will find yourself breathing a whole lot easier  i promise its work  real work  you will be asked to keep a journal  your t will never ask to see it  it is for you  if you want to show it  it fine i have kept a journal since the end of june  before i started therapy  my therapist has never asked to view it but my therapist had seen a ton of my writings  i think my t has far more home work from me than other clients  but that is fine  sometimes your words can speak for you  if there is something you find hard to say  just write it down and hand it to your t  a few week ago my t got a 3 page part of my life i could not say aloud  it a work in progress anyway  i hope i have helped take care  keyplayer  people just dont understand how hard it is for me to go talk to people they just dont understand i used to be afraid to call the pizza delivery guy to buy some pizza i refused to do it i had my friends do it i understand i too have an aversion to using the phone due to anxiety the best way to overcome this anxiety is to force yourself to use the phone more over time the brain will realize that it is not a situation that merits an anxiety response it is very difficult at first but even taking baby steps like ordering pizza on the phone instead of online can be very helpful hi a while back my dr switched me from xanax to klonopin and at first it worked really well at 5mg however i seem to have grown a tolerance in like a year and am already on 3mg per day im supposed to take 1mg at a time but usually have to take 2 to stop my panic and major anxiety sometimes i feel more wound up after taking it anyone have a similar experience should i go back to xanax after 10 years on xanax i had only increased from 5mg to 1mg i didnt build a tolerance this fast now im afraid itll be hard to go off it hi explodingsun56  i am truly sorry for your pain  i understand how hard it can to reach out when you have anxiety issues i would urge you to seek counseling if possible or even talk with your family doctor you are ok  so dont ever let anyone say you are not  in fact i believe you are perfect  it is not always easy to talk to strangers  i used to be the same way as you i stared a little at a time out of necessity  and found it was not so scary after all now people have a hard time keeping me quiet  lol you say your friends order pizza for you  i love pizza too  i have a dominos near me that makes a special pizza just for me  my own custom made pizza i would not have a place where i can get custom made pizza  if i did not ask so maybe the next time you want pizza  maybe a friend could go to the pizza place with and stand by your side while you order  or even hold your hand while you order it will be ok i hope i have in some small way helped  feel free to pm me anytime all my best  and once you get comfortable talking  look out world keyplayer the older you get the less people affect i was like you a long time ago since then i feel bring it on  im a man with very powerful body so nothing bothers me but you can balance that with mace and a 38 and not be afraid of anything or anybody good luck anyone have experience with getting treatment for a phobia i would like to get treatment but dont know where to turn my phobia is of doctors iatrophobia and i hate how it affects my life thank you hello blue i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome

interest family therapist kati morton has a video on her youtube channel with regard to exposure therapy heres a link to that video i dont know of course if youre here simply seeking advice with

depression for a while the health anxiety is taking its toll a lot of things are normal so i dont know where the pain is from i stopped taking the muscle relaxer and my right hand cramps up occasionally i have an mri scheduled for wednesday for my shoulder im running low and hardly anything seems to help now my poetry is rather depressing but its whats running through my head its like im not broken enough hugs and hope for all of you who are suffering im 35 weeks pregnant and last few days ive been highly anxious im scared of birth ive been told i have high blood sugar my hubby has court in two weeks for ongoing custody of my stepdaughter im grinding my teeth again and mouth guard is rubbing i will have a little person relying on me in a few weeks i keep crying im under the care of the perinatal mental health team i see them in a couple of weeks but it might need to be sooner i just wanna be a good mum i had cbt cognitive behaviour therapy as conducted by a psychiatrist i gained skills and mechanisms to cope with my anxieties and fears one thing that was impacting my life negatively was my fear to go out in public in addition to the cbt the psychiatrist used exposure therapy to treat this phobia basically she directed me to go to the grocery store a half hour later each week she even met me there and took me for coffee as a reward and likely to force me to be around people in a busy cafe i still have thoughts that people are constantly judging and criticising me but these thoughts have less impact on my decision to leave the house and combined with coping mechanisms gained through the cbt it makes life easier is it all doctors you fear i ask or does this pertain only to general practitioners if you are able seek professional mental healthcare cbt can be done from the comfort of your own home if a visit is troublesome for you there is plenty of written material on the subject find yourself a good book  preferably a workbook most are designed around a 12wk program it is important you make a commitment to actually do the work exposure therapy i believe you can actually accomplish this perhaps start with a walk by the doctors office next go inside initiate then a conversation with the receptionistassistants let them know of your discomfort and ask if it is possible to simply meet with the doctor at this time be honest about your fear if they are a good doctor they will take this into account and try to be comforting they may then schedule a cursory exam before something more in depth i hope all works out let us know blue02 if you choose to test for yourself with a trained therapist for treatment of phobia it can be rewarding especially if it seems a little invaladating to someone else blue02 had expectations to start the new year with motivation and control and a good routine but these past days were horrible is anyone feeling the same  sometimes i feel like giving up i hate myself oh yes where i live its freezing so its difficult to get any kind of motivation going to do anything there are quite a few articles in psychcentrals archives on the subject of new years resolutions here are links to 4 of them yes im feeling the same way i didnt feel excited about new year eve either i guess its because of the cold weather im not necessarily feeling the same way but it seems different this year hasnt started off as great but it wasnt horrible either theirs a comercial shown on tv a lot lately that really strikes fear in to me it uses music from a tv show in the early 90s a tv show that isnt so much scary but it was for me as a kid gave me nightmares i dont know why looking back its just a harmless cartoon anyway the advert shows some dancing puppets then they talk about the product being advertised then its over but for those 60 seconds its on perhaps a bit less it is terrifying and it seems to show up everywhere during the break in the news or a movie or a soap opera its everywhere i hate it im sorry youre so troubled by this i dont watch much commercial tv mostly we watch shows on our local public television station also i make a point of not watching the news on tv when my wife turns it on i leave the room however when we do watch programs on the commercial tv stations the mute button on the remote gets vigorous exercise i can empathize with you shattered i have to be careful about watchingreading news depending on my anxiety level i dont watch a lot of tv but like skeezyks i prefer public broadcasting channelsand i really dont care for commercials either several commercials have deeply disturbed me i only watch nickelodeon now so i dont have anymore problems i know there was this one commercial where hulk hulligan was destroying this guys house worse commercial ever hi crazygrl882  i am sorry for what you must endure  me too i have taken xanax since 1986  it feels like i have built up a tolerance  however i can tell if i miss a dose or go to long with out taking one i suffer from panic attacks  have need diagnosed as have phobic anxiety  panic attacks  my dosage on the bottle is 1mg qid or 4 times by mouth that does not mean i take that much  after being on the drug for so long there are days i get by with as little as 15 mgs for the whole day  other times i may need more but i have never taken more than that prescribed amount i could  but whats the point if i dont need to  getting back to your question  xanax if a faster acting drug when compared to klonopin and xanax has a shorter acting halflife to put it simpler  xanax is designed to work fast very fast  it is one of if not the fastest acting benzodiazepines  while klonopin take a while longer  it tends to last longer as far as the effect of that drug personally i would be more concerned with which drug makes you feel your best  and dont worry about tolerance  they will all  feel  like they are not working  when in fact they are if you are suffering from panic attacks i would ask your doctor to put you back on xanax try not to be concerned about how much you take  as long as you do not go over the prescribed dosage  rather how you feel my suggestion would be xanax  with a set maximum dose set by you and your doctor  and on days that are aok  just break one in half and see how you feel taking a half after instead of a whole you might find that 5mg  three times a day would work fine and on days with more stress  you would have the extra without exceeding your maximum dosage like i said  i just take what i need  of course being on the same drug for over 30 years  you kinda get to know it  lol i know anxiety  depression  loneliness  and i have feelings that wont be described until they come out with the dsm 7  plus i am trying to get over grief and loss  if that were not enough you can throw in dysphoria while you are at it  i have such a fun time  not really you will be fine  i can assure you of that  xanax  klonopin are very close and equal as far as mg to mg  xanax fast  last short  klonopin slower  last longer  that really the only difference  i am not a doctor or any type of medical professional  just someone who has seen too much i hope i have helped  if you need me  just pm me take care  keyplayer hello welcome to pc i agree that the right therapist could help you work through this i hope you get this resolved jennifer 1967 and i also dont get it i went to bed without a worry i already slept for a while so i was relaxed enough to fall asleep but then i wake up and feel all shaky and i cant sleep anymore and the heating in my building is off at night so when i try to read to distract myself my arms and hands get very cold whenever it snow i get physically sick when i smell snow in the air i didnt really care for snow when i was a toddler and by the time i was six year old i didnt really like the smell it had made sick to smell it and within a year i became absolutely terrified of snow because i moved into another city i live there before but i didnt know why i had gotten sick before but it was never as bad as it was when i was seven years old i live in a city that had containment water due to a chemical spill that had happen before i moved to a city a chemical plant had invent a bug repellent in a form of a spray that was supposed to kill bugs when sprayed on but it didnt work so a number of people had call in to complained and they did a callback on the bug spray refunding the money to all those who had bought the bug spray the chemical was transport in a truck that had some kind of accident on a road and the chemical spill out on the road and had gotten into the water the resident woke up the next morning and found ants and other insect dead and it was found later on when people started complaining that they were getting very sick so those who had become very sick all complained that had drinking water or had touch the water in someway but no one who had become sick had become suspicious of the water because it look clean and tasted normal it had never occurred to anyone that it may have been the water that had made them sick it wasnt until someone had taken a sample and found out that there was bug repellent in the water and they trace the chemical to a company who had a truck transporting the chemical somewhere else and the driver apparently wasnt aware that chemical had end in the water the company was shut down but the water is still really bad i had drink water without being informed that there had been a chemical spill i lost two years of my life being sicked i missed half the school year and i couldnt play with my friends because of how gravel ill i had become and no doctor know what was wrong with me i could still develop cancer or eventually have amnesia because i had drink contaminated water i got trapped in snow and couldnt get out of the driveway my fear of snow had intensified and now i feel claustrophobia and get physically sick i feel like i am dying and i feel trapped like i cant get out i dont want be a home but i dont want to leave my house i just want to go somewhere during the winter where it is warm all year around im sorry to hear about this i dont really know how to help you but it may help to talk to some friends in so you can distract yourself from your feelings the best thing to do is to contact the help of a counselor im sorry if i couldnt help if you perhaps could find a way to try some winter activities might this then change your mind it may alleviate the sense of being trapped for me it is the cold which makes me feel claustrophobic buffy01 are there any places suitable to go for a walk i was once quite active outdoors including even camping in winter those days are now behind me but i still try to get out even if it is only for 510min there is a park nearby with a lot of snow over it i have a pair of snowshoes which allow me to tromp around a bit it gets my blood pumping and cheeks rosy i usually reward myself with something to warm me up when i return an evening walk beneath the streetlights in softly falling snow i find to be quite beautiful buffy01 hi i used to have this problem really bad a few years ago but it went away but now its back i really need to go to the bathroom but im so anxious about people judging me for many things like how long im in the bathroom or how much toilet paper i use etc this anxiety makes me not want to go if anyone is near me when i need to go to a public washroom i tend to freeze i do my best to talk myself out of this fear and eventually i do go but it takes a lot of effort and energy to do a basic task how do others cope with this caelix3 i panic that people are looking at me through the frack between the stall wall and the door if i can completely see them they can completely see me so does anyone else have this fear that when they leave this world they will just be forgotten fade from everyones memory i do and its terrifying actually this is my goal to simply disappear as totally  completely as it is possible for a person to disappear from this world to fade away like the cheshire cat leaving nothing behind but my grimace for a while there will still be records of my having existed thankfully no one will pay any attention to them but if i could i would erase every last vestige of myself from the world songs that skip make me anxious if im listening to a song and it skips i cant listen to it the same way even if it does play all the way through i have this problem with shallet by emilie autumn because the song skipped at a certain point now it makes me anxious and when it gets to that particular part i have to turn it down that or cover my ears and my ea cd doesnt jump or have scratches on it so no excuses hello trust well i dont know a lot about these sorts of things but from what you describe this sounds like a panic attack to me i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit may

hoping everybody has a good weekend i have anxiety about some family concerns and let it get away from me yesterday its hard to tell what is my gad and what is part of the normal ebb and flow of life if that makes sense hugs to all those that are struggling i was a ta in a university it was my first time being a ta i confronted an aggressive and arrogant student who disagreed with the marks i gave without giving a legitimate reason he yelled at me loudly and even hit the desk i was shocked and at a loss after the student venting anger on me i reported to the professor and department chair they had a talk with him to tell his behavior was unacceptable i also sent him several emails to accuse of him i ask lots of people online and they did give me good advice on how should i have dealt with such a student however my grievance is still unresolved i can still remember the evil look and hostile behavior of that student even though i may not see him again i feel that not only do i have hatred towards him but also unsatisfied with my weakness facing this student i should have bravely fought back and asked him to leave how should i deal with this bad experience im not going to say what it was because its too personal to me to fully open up about it at this point but the effect that it had on my was that i tried to ignore it at first and tried to just push the feelings and thoughts away until the movie ended which was soon thank goodness after the movie ended i got up off of the floor because i was nervous and was being bombarded by negative feelings and fears about what may have happened to me as a child and my suspicions about all of that i felt anxiety and depression coming my way and suddenly there was a pretty intense fear that a blocked memory from my childhood was about to show up and even though i couldnt see it i had a feeling that i knew what it was and that just about sent me into a panic because i didnt want to see it and v one of my supportive alters had to calm me down and i was nauseated too but had to force myself to eat to counter the depression that was coming over me and growing by the second i ate some ramen noodles because that helps me to feel better when im depressed and afterward i still couldnt shake the depression and took a nap for about an hour and a half or so and when i awoke i did feel better and had my self control back to almost normal i just want to know if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this with the fear dread and panic of a long ago unseen memory threatening to show itself and if it could possibly be an indication that i was abused in some way that was so bad that the memory of it had to be blocked i see my t in two days but i dont know if i can hold out that long any advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance mav can i suggest you post this on the ptsd board too ill chat with you in a bit as well shattered sanity lately ive started to feel this tightness in chest above my heart i get super aware of this feeling when it comes which makes me anxious and very uncomfortable my heart feels highly reactive like it gets easily excited shocked scared this feeling comes and goes its less profound in the mornings probably coz i take propranalol 20 mg which im gonna ask my doc to prescribe me for afternoons and evenings as well now but i m just wondering if anybody else can relate to this feeling how diddo they dealdealt with it i can only share my experience loads of times now i have been to the hospital had doctors out etc etc because i feel that im having a heart attack they have constantly said to me your hearts fine youre hearts fine if it was a heart attack wed know its just your anxiety it reasures me for a while but then i get the same fear and i know i need to stop this because its wasting valuable time of the hospital staff last year they spent a whole day doing tests on my heart for absolutely nothing i suffer from general anxiety disorder and at times from ptsd i witnessed a homicide i have applied and got accepted for a crisis hot line position i want your feedback what can i do to help people going through a crisis that will help make things easier what do you need to hear what do you expect what questions do you want me to ask how can i get you thinking clearly again do i just need to let you vent or do you need me to help walk you out of the quicksand your feedback means a lot to me thank you for sharing your experience with me obviously its a potentially volatile trigger topic for you given your experience yet you chose to read my message and reply in a way that will help me which speaks to your character of how brave and kind you are are they giving you any training most lines have rules on what you can say  cant for legal liability check with your prescriber as this could be a reaction to one or a combination it may be a physical signal that there is something you need to pay attention to obviously your body is trying to tell you something wish at times it could just appear on a piece of paper whole lot easier quotesunnydisposition5963829thank you for sharing your experience with me

comfort items when i feel depressed or anxious i use my wand to help me calm down but it isnt on the desk and it isnt on the floor i cant find my wand anywhere and i need to find it i need to ing find it any luck im sorry i hope you find it shattered sanity im sorry i found my magic wand its in my pants shattered sanity ive been having something that seems kindof in between anxiety and panic attacks but one feature i havent seen anyone else post about is that i start feeling and speaking like a child or baby sometimes i literally talk baby talk like goo goo gaga type stuff and once that was followed by screaming for mama but i didnt feel very scared just thought it was interesting other times words like what a toddler would say spontaneously pop into my head and i say them out loud usually along with hiding under a blankie and crying like a sad toddler another time all within the same episode i did the baby talk toddler talkcrying and then some 12yearold stuff has anyone heard of something like this that goes with anxiety or panic hi yall im quite ashamed to write this but im going to do it anyway i have always been an anxious person and for the last two years i have been through a rough time however its going pretty well lately despite this since a week or 2 i suddenly got a vague fear that does affect my daily life i am constantly worried that everything around me is fake that i am in a coma or that i am dreaming that everything that happened in my life and now happens in my life has never happened and never is happening that the people i love do not even exist it sounds really crazy now i am writing this down  i do not understand where this fear suddenly comes from though i also wonder whether i actually believe in it or whether it is more of a fear itself i think it is mainly fear but i keep wondering why we are here on earth what i am doing here in the world why i look like the way i look i want to have answers to everything because i feel so unsafe in one way or another when you think about it life is very vague right we do not even know why we are here how we got here and what it would be like if life had never been possible then there was just nothing at all  how strange is that i probably think too much and too deep and sometimes i am almost afraid of becoming psychotic although i have never had psychoses every time i experience something fun i think there is no point in enjoying it because it is not real this is your experience but the people around you are not real maybe you are controlled like in a computer game or you are in a coma and this is all an illusion  i find it difficult to explain  i also do not know if there is a type of underlying depression somewhere i am afraid of death on the other hand i long for death because i want to know what happens then and i feel like i am going crazy about the concerning and anxious thoughts like i said i have had a difficult period and am now recovering from it things are finally getting better and i feel happier but now i think it does not matter how i feel because everything is fake for example i like being with people i love helping people i love but there is no point in helping people i love if these people dont even exist maybe this is a kind of derealization  depersonalization or im just going crazy i just think its a very scary idea that we do not know why we are here there is just no explanation and that makes me all think of things myself  i am now also afraid that i will never be able to enjoy life again because i am afraid that life does not exist at all in any case i will stop rattling now i wondered if anyone has any idea what this is and why i suddenly think this way and if someone recognizes it  on google i came across some recognizable experiences nevertheless i like to post my own story here well im not qualified to suggest what it is youre experiencing or why it is youre thinking this way perhaps its simply the result of a buildup of anxiety however from my perspective this is something you really need to work through with a mental health professional otherwise any suggestions you get are as likely to be wrong as they are right and they may just make you even more concerned than you already are under any circumstances theres certainly nothing to be ashamed of here are links to a couple of articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of some help with what you are experiencing hi im late but id love to answer your question look some time ago i would have identified myself a lot with that but today i see how it makes no sense to think like that i mean are we here right i and you and thousands of people in the world and there should be a sense for all that and as much as we do not know and probably will never know it is important that we look on the other side these thoughts will not help you in your recovery they will only sink you deeper i mean how could they help you so after i started to think like that after i started to stop looking for meaning in life and tried to make sense of it everything changed it is common to have episodes of depersonalization when you are anxious especially if you are curious and want to frantically find out everything about everything the origin of life take it easy because you will not get there in my case i wanted a proof at my feet that god existed so i being unable to do worse decided to search for reasons to believe and not believe in god and everything absolutely everything about both beliefs made sense and it started to eat me up and eat me alive i was in such a big crisis and i did not know where to run but one day i decided i would take it easy and talking to other people also got the help needed from what i have read your case is more to the derealization than the depersonalization itself although it could be both research it it is very common to feel this studies say that everyone will have at least one episode in life just try not to feed those thoughts but anyway i think what i have to tell you is this take it easy and ill be here if you need to thank you so much for your response i feel a bit better now i share my thoughts instead of keeping it to myself it also helps me to be with other people and have distraction but sometimes all of a sudden i feel really axious and i have these thoughts like what if all of this isnt real i will never find out whether other people are truly alive  that they are in the same room as i am right now perhaps this is a dream it sounds so silly now i am writing this but sometimes it suddenly attacks me that anxiety feeling did you also experience that so not only wanting to know why we are here but also the anxiety feeling of what if i am not really alive feels really like you are trapped or something i just cant understand life but you are right  we all dont know why we are here and probably we will never really know btw i wish you all a happy new year happy new year justafriend306 justafriend306 well yes i experienced it all exactly this way and i dont think i actually talked to anyone at the time but i dont regret it the problems exist and we should not give in to them for if we do we will be doing everything we should not do you control your problems you who faces them this is the nature of life and this is part of his maturation that was another thought that helped me you know youd be surprised at the number of people going through existential crises obviously they present themselves in different ways and each faces them differently but yes everyone goes through it especially in the youth that is when we want to understand everything and know ourselves and even if this is not the case okay each one in its time we are constantly getting to know ourselves and when you get out of it youre somebody else think about it as much as youre not religious or believe in some god or something greater what would become of us without the problems we would have everything in hand and there would be no evolution either as a person or spiritist i know its easy to talk but its not like ive never been through it i went through all this to be here today and be able to tell you that you can too and i can assure you its worth it and no your feelings do not seem ridiculous give them value and another way i found to distract myself from all of this was to try to get to know myself better and read about things that i liked or even about similar experiences i really had no idea who i was or what i wanted so i decided to take some time for me this helped me a bit because when you know who you are you know how to control your feelings you know what you should do for yourself or not i also learned to say more the word no something very important sometimes when im worried about the point where such a crisis hits me i think no laura youre not going to feed this and then i get distracted by something again just accept that it is a phase that you have to go through and does not prohibit you from feeling your feelings you have the right amandalouise thank you so much that was very helpful hello welcome to pc yes i do i get chest pains so bad it feels like a heart attack when i have a panic attack i typically put my hand on my chest i have also had a couple ekgs done so i know its not my heart it doesnt hurt to get it checked out by a doctor you have described a lot of what i have felt it helps to know other people feel this too just a couple days ago i thought i was a computer program and not a person the reason i thought this was because there will be times of eerie synchronicity for example i will be reading a word just as someone says itbut this will seem to happen multiple time over a period of days i used to shrug that off as weird but lately think similar thoughts as you have described i will share with you something i have discovered about this it may just be my own experience but i think this has to do with some kind of brain injury it doesnt have to be a major injury so dont worry about that i think it can also be from medications too much sugar caffeine or alcohol i had a toxic experience with mercury in a medication i was having the awful physical symptoms but the derealizationdepersonalization got much worse i felt comfort in the fact that the drdp meant that my brain was trying to heal itself it makes sense that your brain would put itself into a dreamlike state so as not to have to expend more energy processing information while trying to recover its why we sleep after all you mentioned that you had gone through a hard time i would consider that another form of brain trauma while you are experiencing stress there are neurochemical processes that can change your brain but luckily our brains have neuroplasticity which just means that damage in one part will prompt growth or compensation in another part what has helped me are my pets and really trying to take it easy and get enough sleep i have made an effort to avoid negative stress as much as possible i have noticed that when i cannot i revert back a little into dpdr do not worry it will get better with rest lovelybones i keep hearing war cyrens outside you know the ones that go off when you need to evacuate i know its logical that in england they probably wont be going off at the moment because its raining and it seems quiet outside apart from the cyrens but i dont know why i can hear them i just can about 6 months ago i started to change ive been dealing with social anxiety for all my life but it started to slowly dissappear but that wasnt the only change that happened as time passed i started to become less sensible it started with small things like not empathising with people and it eventually lead to a lack of empathy and very shallow emotions though this has made it very hard to keep relationships ive learned how to live with it and i strictly follow certain rules to avoid harming people that i care aboutcare about me last but not least the scariest change im going through is depersonalization i have very varied episodes from feeling that everything is fake to thinking that im dead and being scared of finding my own corpse anywhere they can happen anywhere but they usually occur at night when im alone or if something triggers it eg certain types of music i can cope fairly good with them but theyre still a pain in the  i think my brain uses depersonalization and apathy to cope with the anxiety and though im very happy with my life right now as its not that difficult for me to meet new people or to cope with depersonalization the episodes are getting worse and im scared ill become even more apathetic and feel nothing is there any way i can get my emotions back and teach my brain to cope with anxiety differently thank you so much hello nalek im sorry youre experiencing this difficulty im afraid theres not much i can offer personally with regard to this however heres a link to an ask the therapist article from pcs archives in this article a therapist replies to someone wrote about having experienced a loss of the ability to feel emotions likewise heres a link to another ask the therapist article where a therapist replies to someone who wrote saying that they feel reality is unreal ultimately my personal feeling is that this is probably something that would be best explored with the help of a mental health professional perhaps some other members here on pc will have some similar experiences they can share i wish you well ps heres a link to a third ask the therapist article wherein a therapist replied to a person who wrote they were experiencing weird and crazy thoughts and questioning reality the reply this therapist offered was a bit darker than the two above but i thought it might be worthwhile to provide you with the link im curious to know if anything happened 6 months ago that you could possibly attribute to your current loss of feelings it sounds like you are someone who is pretty stoic already by your description of how you cope the other thing i would think of is did you increase a dose of something or take something new even herbal supplements i too have social anxiety my whole life but have had sudden onset of new symptoms that i found had an external cause im on the brink of a panic attack because of the most stupid reason i used to text my ex while listening to a playlist i made a long time ago we would chat late into the night while i listened to the same songs over and over again for some reason i decided to listen to these songs some of them i listened to regularly while others were specific to the playlist and i never listened to them outside of the playlist one of the songs that i rarely listened to outside of the playlist started playing and it immediately felt like a gut punch my heart leapt from my chest and tears came to my eyes my ex and i broke up about a year ago does anybody know why little things like that can be so psychologically damaging i have a similar problem i listened to the same greatest hits album in the car while my late husband was in the hospital as a way of comforting myself this went on for nearly three months before he passed away im ok if a popular song that ive heard a lot comes on the radio but if i hear one of those songs i rarely hear outside of playing this album it is gut wrenching i think its just a matter of association i remember being in that place whiteknuckling it in the car completely stressed out knowing it was near the end then i think last time i heard this he was aliveits an avalanche of emotions when i was a kid i hated this song from a comercial i hated the song and the comercial it gave me nightmares well last year they did on tv the top 50 comercials over the past 20 years my first thoughts were they are going to do that song they are going to do that song so i avoided watching it that is until i turned the tv on with the intention of watching something on another channel well the programme about comercials came up and id chosen that moment to turn it on when they were doing that bloody song complete with the freaky comercial pictures they used too urg hello azteker i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs

there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting does mess and clutter effect any of you i get so anxious about it and stress myself out my son is so messy he has severe adhd that contributes he also has odd and a low iq that makes it hard to get his help i cant even come close to having a clean house unless i clean several hours a day i dont have that kind of energy especially with depression i do about an hour a day slightly more on weekends i wont have people over because i get so embarrassed like i seriously panic when someone shows up it doesnt look like i clean at all i get sensory overload because of it im constantly mad at my child and sometimes resent him what to do im sorry youre having to deal with this yes mess  clutter would be difficult for my wife  i to deal with too fortunately for us its just the two of us plus we live in a townhome so things stay pretty clean although we do have a dog  he helps keep the place from being too immaculate also were not savers anything we dont seem to have a use for we get rid of over time ive actually gotten rid of some things i now wish i had back but its too late now from what you wrote it sounds as though youre doing more cleaning than we do on a daytoday basis i tend to do quite a bit of spot cleaning im always on the lookout for areas that seem to need attention and if i see something i take care of it thenthere that way theres less of a need for major cleaning efforts unfortunately i dont know as there is much of anything i could suggest to you here you didnt mention how old your son is or if hes in school etc perhaps if hes receiving special education or rehabilitation services learning to help out around home could be something the people who work with him could focus on if not perhaps looking into what might be available in terms of inhome services might be worth while the key here it seems to me is to find some way of teaching him to help take care of things his disabilities probably do contribute to his messiness but they should not be allowed to be an excuse for turning you into his servant i wish you well i have a great need for order i need things neat and tidy things like the hardcore cleaning may fall by the wayside for example i dust vacuum scour the bathroom regularly but i am lazy when it comes to things like baseboards and the oven but my place is always presentable and orderly  you never know if someone might pop over this stems from prior experience my mother allowed the house to get cluttered in university i lived with an aunt who was a hoarder messes make me anxious too i cant work on school stuff without having a clean area around me i just have to clean up my area near my desk before i start working which takes time as i realize all the other things i need to do i cant do anything productive without having a clean area my anxiety goes through the roof cocosurviving anonymous50013 i know this isnt a thing but i was wondering peoples opinion on this i have social anxiey that is a definite i dont know if id call myself claustrophobic because i dont really put myself in small spaces when i am around a lot of people i start to become very uncomfortable im anxious at the idea of having to relate or talk to other people but thats not a factor here just the thought of people around me makes me anxious everything gets really loud for me i start to squirm if someone bumps into me i feel physical pain inside me i become hyper vigilant i just dont like to be around people like at all my father says hes the same way were misanthropes he says does anyone else feel this way around people im not sure if its my social anxiety or some form of claustrophobia vans1974 does anyone else have any insight on this itd be very appreciated i feel the same way i often feel an ackwardness when around too many people i seem to loose all train of thought and find it very difficult to make conversations i am too preoccupied on different things such as what they think of me why a they looking at me the way they are and how am i going to get out of this situation as for claustrophobia i do believe that there is a link between claustrophobia and social anxiety i think many people believe that claustrophobia is purely a fear of small spaces such as lifts caves and small rooms but they forget about the situation like talking to people and feeling as though you are suffocating in a situation that doesnt have to be physically confined but internally confining i was looking online and found this info about how there is in fact a link between the two causes of claustrophobia claustrophobia is actually generally considered a symptom of anxiety rather than its own anxiety disorder this is likely because most people that develop claustrophobia already have at least some type of mild anxiety take my anxiety test to find out more about your anxiety this makes some sense too because several disorders seem to be affected by or play a role in claustrophobia generalized anxiety disorder it seems that generalized anxiety disorder seems to play a role in the development of claustrophobia most likely there is some correlation between what led to a person developing the condition and what leads to the development of anxiety panic disorder when someone is in an enclosed space they become more likely to suffer from a severe panic attack chances are that the individual was at greater risk of panic attacks or panic disorder which means that they already showed at the very least a genetic predisposition tot the condition social phobia those with social phobia often experience a feeling of needing to escape as part of the condition although generally its not limited to enclosed spaces its possible that some of this fear ends up tangentially passing over to the way they feel in any small space hopefully this is helpful in someway an inspiring story im sure all these years havent been easy on you but you took charge of the situation and you fixed it not just fixed it you made it fun celebrate this victory and take the same attitude to your life moving forward all the best had to go to the hospital few weeks ago for a minor surgery was horrrible as soon as i entered the building my heart started pounding and i felt i lost control of myself considering how new this is to me it was so scary i hope this goes away i felt extremely distressed just reading this its very difficult for me to think about the idea of being locked away somewhere with people and i have to stay attentive 247 so i do not even leave the house i feel that there is something beyond anxiety and i like to call it social claustrophobia when i find myself in situations where i have to face this kind of thing i soon find myself losing my head and the fine line between sanity and insanity i feel like im not too far from the last option i often find myself so nervous around people that it is so common for me to lose my line of reasoning in the middle of speech or else to forget words memories sometimes i just say to the person hey i have something to tell you and i forget its really quite embarrassing i feel ridiculous over time i have forgotten so much and today my memory is so bad all i wanted was not having to go through all this my doc just prescribed me lyrica for anxiety and i am ashamed to say that i cannot bring myself about to take it i read the basic side effect profile after i came home and they were scary like a few of them were swollen lymph nodes arms legs kidney damage cognitive impairment weight gain and so on i have health anxiety so this is pretty heavy for me to digest i keep feeling guilt like im letting my doctor down and mostly myself down by not even trying it but if i try it i know ill be in a constant state of panic can anybody else relate to this i understand every time i read the potential side effects of my meds my anxiety goes through the roof lithium alone can cause kidney and thyroid problems i had to have an ekg for an old med due to heart risks it is scary in my case though i just cant live without my meds at least not a happy life so i take them if you are anxious speak to your doctor about the risks the odds are likely small for the major ones and make your decision from there sunnydisposition it will be okay asking to switch meds is completely reasonable it is a crappy hand to be delt but we just have to make the best of it sunnydisposition anytime merry christmas man i cannot stand the way that doctors play fastandloose with medications i take 900mg of lyrica daily for neuropathy and nerve damage i have heard of gabapenten being used as mood stabilizer and for anxiety but this is the first that i have heard of lyrica being used for anxiety yes buspar is an antianxiety med lyrica is not do as recommended and voice your concerns not so much concerning the sideeffects but about the difference in the medications anonymous50013 docs sometimes perscibe off brand meds meaning the fda while not officially endorsing a certain drug for a specific treatment studies show it works or its still in various clinical trials for treatment drug reps cant discuss this but other docs or clinicians can i am having some serious concerns that i need to see if anyone else has experienced i have had a stressful 5 months i moved i was diagnosed with an autoimmune skin disease called hidradenitis suppurativa and fell into a pit of anxietydepression it feels as though i am stuck in a loop because i am sure many of the symptoms i feel are from my anxiety but once i latch onto a thought its like i cant let it go i have been in a relationship for 4 years and we had been living together for almost 3 years when i had to move back home due to health concerns ever since then i feel like i cant connect with people i cant feel love or connection and i feel like a monster i dont know if this is a symptom of anxiety or depression or what is happening to me but i literally cannot remember what happiness or love feels like at this point and i am so frustrated because i know that i do love these people because nothing has actually changed other than my perceptions i suppose i should also mention that i quit smoking marijuana around the time these symptoms of anxietydepression started everything in my romantic relationship and family relationships were great prior to this and i just cant understand why i suddenly cant feel anything is it because i am so focused on it is it because i really am a monster am i losing my mind am i just so stuck in my head that it will never be possible for me to get better i used to be so confident in what i wanted a career kids marriage and since this all started i have these thoughts that none of that can ever happen for me since i cant feel connection anymore i feel so bad because my boyfriend and family have been so supportive the last few months and i have just been faking a lot of my emotions just to not alarm anyone the only thing that has gotten me by is the thought that actually crazy people dont realize they are crazy so im probably not actually going crazy i should also mention that i have been unable to see a psychologist due to insurance but i also will not take any antidepressant or anti anxiety medication due to a bad allergic reaction i experienced to an antibiotic i was on for my skin i am all for natural remedies and have been wanting to try cbd oil as i have heard it has done wonders for other people and this all started after i quit smoking marijuana which i know greatly affects the limbic system where our emotions are housed has anyone else tried cbd oil or experienced what i am going though i just want my life back and i want to be able to genuinely tell my boyfriend how much i love him and my family i love them without this annoying anxiety in the back of my mind that was never there before i dont really know where to exactly put this but most of my problems see to be related to my anxiety so figured id post it here now because of my anxiety i depersonalize however yesterday at school it didnt feel like my typical depersonalizing usually i feel like im in someone elses body and someone is talking for me and my body parts arent mine yesterday i started with a rapid heart beat and my learning leader put her apple watch on my wrist cuz she has an app on there that detects your heart beat mine was 143 it eventually went down to 90 but my hands began to shake more violently through out the day when i started getting anxiety it didnt feel like how i usually feel like im surrounded by things that want to attack me it instead felt like i was being chased when i finally began to break i went into the break room to text my mom to come and get me when i was walking in the hallway i suddenly felt like i wasnt in reality it hit me like a train but i realized it didnt feel like my particular depersonalizing experience i didnt feel like i was in someone elses body everything seemed to look weird i dont know how to particularly describe it like it was distorted i began feeling as if i was in a dream and i slowly became more convinced i was dreaming i kept thinking this wasnt reality nothing was real i had a lot of trouble speaking id forget what i had just said in the middle of a sentence and completely forget what i was trying to say or was about to say when i had to go with my mom for christmas shopping before my sister got off work i felt like any mi ute my legs were going to give out and collapse i felt like i couldnt walk properly i had to hold onto my mom to make sure i was walking right i kept obsessing over my shaking hands kept checking my pulse to see if it was going up i tried not to think about it but i couldnt stop this morning it started off like yesterday but today i had something new happen no matter how many deep breaths i took i felt like my body wasnt receiving oxygen i felt as if i was legitimately suffocating i have no clue what happened so i have no clue what could have caused this this sounds very similar to my experiences have you been taking any new meds even otc had any vaccines recently eaten anything like fish the symptoms you describe sound like some sort of toxicity dont discount anything even a cold medicine because this is what did it for me actually there is a longer story but i want to wait for your response first and hope you are feeling better because it can be very scary it sounds like you were having a panic attack there is a quick breathing exercise that works well for me find a safe place where you can sit down and be alone if you can breath in through your nose slowly for a count of 7 seconds  11000 21000 31000 etc filling your lungs completely then hold your breath for 7 seconds then exhale out of your mouth slowly for 7 seconds your breath should be expelled completely around 7 seconds if done at a correct pace give or take a second it takes a little practice so dont give up then repeat until your heart rate has decreased it usually takes a minute or two of doing this to bring your heart rate down to a normal rate it also grounds you in reality as you are focusing on your breath its hard to do anything but panic when your heart rate is up so high so just simply focusing on bringing your heart rate down will improve all of your symptoms bringing you back to reality ps panic attacks can be exacerbated by caffeine lack of sleep hunger dehydration pms stress obviously make sure all of your basic needs have been met sometimes just assessing yourself for a minute can help you identify what has set you off knowing is half the battle often times we can correct something to help soothe our panic having said that sometimes there isnt an obvious reason and that is ok when did you start suffering with anxiety did anything trigger it what triggers it now i remember as far back as age 6 i would just start hyperventilating out of the blue my mom would make me breathe into a paper bag not sure if it really worked or the attack just passed on its own i dont remember why this would happen at the time these days the culprit is my own mind i often get paranoid about things that arent even true or relevant for example ill imagine my bf cheating on me ill obsess over it until i convince myself its true even though there is absolutely no reason to believe it or when im driving i think about what if i get into an accident its when my mind wonders like this that i start to shake breathing gets shallow and i have to chew an ativan stuck in tunnel vision certain that the future only holds the worstcase scenarios ive had my ups and downs lately but it has been a few months since ive felt this desperate grasping for reassurance i guess i should admit to myself that i am handling it okay all things considered im not crying my eyes out every few hours like i might have done before im just sitting with this feeling letting it wear itself out rather than feeding it my energy and prolonging its life hopefully hi im late but id love to answer your question look some time ago i would have identified myself a lot with that but today i see how it makes no sense to think like that i mean are we here right i and you and thousands of people in the world and there should be a sense for all that and as much as we do not know and probably will never know it is important that we look on the other side these thoughts will not help you in your recovery they will only sink you deeper i mean how could they help you so after i started to think like that after i started to stop looking for meaning in life and tried to make sense of it everything changed it is common to have episodes of depersonalization when you are anxious especially if you are curious and want to frantically find out everything about everything the origin of life take it easy because you will not get there in my case i wanted a proof at my feet that god existed so i being unable to do worse decided to search for reasons to believe and not believe in god and everything absolutely everything about both beliefs made sense and it started to eat me up and eat me alive i was in such a big crisis and i did not know where to run but one day i decided i would take it easy and talking to other people also got the help needed from what i have read your case is more to the derealization than the depersonalization itself although it could be both research it it is very common to feel this studies say that everyone will have at least one episode in life just try not to feed those thoughts but anyway i think what i have to tell you is this take it easy and ill be here if you need to i had a hysterectomy in 2011 right after i started having mood swings by 2012 i was first misdiagnosed with depression put on just an antidepressantit flipped me over into full blown mania after a second opinion i learned it was bipolar one childhood abuse my mother was severely mentally ill with extreme problems with rage i wont describe it ive never seen or heard of anything like her various methods of terrorizing me obviously she caused my problems ive had emotional issues for as long as i can remember seriously kindergarten i threw up and had other stress reactions for years in elementary school didnt talk enough or got too emotional over my pet dying and had to be practically quarantined to the library or got creeped out by stories no one else got creeped out by i had this big angry chip on my shoulder about feeling like i was weird and different from everybody else until i was about 14 or 15 i had a lovehate relationship with that feeling resenting how i thought everyone else felt about me versus being glad i was different from them a lot of details there that probably arent necessary but im not sure what they mean as far as anxiety or depression symptoms in a child so im just throwing it all out cocosurviving my ex the sociopath triggered meno exaggeration he was diagnosed as antisocial sociopath during our divorce by two independent pdocs he terrorized me my childhood wasnt perfect by any means but i was doing fine till i married the charming sociopath i first was dealing with some psychotic depression back in 2014 and anxiety followed that after i was hospitalized and missed a lot of school currently my anxiety was triggered by starting college and that spiraled into another episode of psychotic depression i think major life changes triggers my anxiety then it is hard to put a stop to it i dont really know what triggered mine but i was around 910 when i noticed now this year things have happened that has bought it all to the forefront again i get the shakes too like trembling inside apart from other things its tiring lol take care its back to this back to not being able to even think about opening the bedroom door without shaking uncontrollably if i do make it out of the room i start panic cleaning rearranging and pacing if i step outside full blown panic attacks and my other stuff hallucinations mostly get drastically worse when someones with me this stuff still happens but i use the other person to sort of ground me it makes it a little easier i cant keep doing this i have to get a job so i can help pay some bills but how can i do that when i cant even leave this room sorry im just venting i guess you need an anxiety intervention follow and heed any advice and treatment your doc offers you at this point coz this is very serious anything to get out and about coz staying in for prolonged periods of time is downward slide to a depressive hell i literally drag myself out of the bed for 1 hour walks in the sun everyday am action that goes against every fiber of my body which is screaming stay inside even if youre miserable just stay inside the world outside is scary and on and on my inner voice goes but i do it anyways and i always feel better after my walks i feel sane centered and that voice never really goes away it goes along with me for walks and is constantly screaming turn back go homemy point is we gotta do what we know is healthy and essential to keep us sane youre anxiety is obviously higher than mine so get every help from your doctor you can use benzos for temporarily getting you out of the house coz the rewards outweighs the cons in this case are you able to expose yourself to the rest of the home gradually day by day s leigheas yes thank god for xanax i wasnt too anxious today but there was nothing to stress me out since it was just a relaxing day but ill take the less anxiety whenever i can get it mine was stress from being moved around during 20122013 moved from my grandparents to my sisters apartment then my mums house and eventually back to my grandparents that ended in what i can only assume was a psychotic break ended up being taken out of public school because i couldnt handle being around anyone thought i was an embarrassment etc i was always a quiet oversensitive kid who panicked over public presentations and pretty much any teamwork activity but that seemed to blow me over the edge it started when i was five when i went to kindergarten and everyone thought i was weird add childhood abuse and i was one messedup kid it was worst at an important part of my civilian career when i was doing well jobwise i ended up losing my job and going on disability it took five years of meds and therapy but i still live a real structured life and anxiety erupts when things change im not really sure what triggered it but i have always been anxious since i was 3 or so i had some english problems as i spoke later in life at 2 i just know that i have always been afraid of people judging me for anything i have always been extremely emotional but as a kid if i made a mistake or had to do something social i would just cry people made fun of me because i cried daily sometimes even more than that ive always been afraid of people now its mainly with presentations i still have generalized social and nonsocial fears though i grew up in a family with a hostile abusive father you always walked on eggshells because you never knew what would set him off i think that in addition to being ruthlessly bullied in middle school set me up for anxiety i dont have a good feel for triggers except one of my siblings who is a clone of my dad i have anxiety and panic attacks out of nowhere most times its distressing since my father abandoned us to cause mum severe anxiety a whole bunch of responsibility fell on me to stay strong and supportive to her and my little sister it triggered some anxiety even in me and find it difficult coping until my partner comes home from seeing a client occasionally i get stressed but nullify that by a good work out in our home gym but our mum continues suffering im taking my personal anxiety on a onedayatatime basis funny but as soon i get onstage to perform i become a wholly different person and the anxiety though can morph into stage fright just melts away the evenings at home can be difficult though i feel much better after eating dinner i have had anxiety forever first serious symptom when i realized also i have anxiety was after hospital release it was so severe i fell on the floor and all my muscles went into some form of lock down i dont even have a word for it it was more physical then psychological as if i was suspended in a cell and had to go out in the world and none of my limbs knew how to behave cocosurviving in third grade at recess    finding myself all alone i realized i was different and didnt fit in i was 8 i guess that was the start of social anxiety i had used to play with other kids i dont remember how i turned into an oddball i had mine early this summer i had cosmetic surgery male breast augmentation done in february something i had wanted for a long time surgery recovery went well happy with results my sister had a pool party i was so looking forward to going got there no issues later had my first attack since then i cant go to a pool or situation where i like that i need to wear very loose or baggy shirts tops also being alone in large crowds is unsettling to me wear prior to the party i was fine this is a little hard to say because in hindsight i realise i have been sick all my life i dealt with a lot of drama and trauma from a very early age and as a result learned that people are cruel and cannot be trusted early on my first memory of being different was the first day of kindergarten i realised that day that other kids were happy and full of life i on the other hand was scared anxious and vigilant about my safety i suffer from a great deal of anxiety triggered by multiple stimuli but it is a fear of what someone might do next and how it will affect me that frightens me most mavriforcek9r im frequently awake late at night its one of the benefits so to speak of being old anyway when i cant sleep ill get up  do walking meditation when its cold ill wrap myself up in a blanket i walk quietly aroundaround our dark  quiet townhome typically for at least an hour sometimes longer i focus light attention on each foot as it makes contact with the floor thoughts comego i let them arisefade at their own pace i hear the sounds of the city off in the distance i enjoy this so much that when i havent had occasion to do it for a while i start to miss it okay i havent read the original post or the comments just saw the question in the subject line i was at a concert for a childrens chorus tonight and the director in his remarks to the audience mentioned that singing is good for people because it causes them to breathe deeper and its the only thing you can do from age 18 months until you die i have always had issues with breathing exercises for anxiety but i thought this could be a good idea im going to make a list of a few songs i like that i also feel like i sing well and when i start to feel anxiety attacks or panic attacks im going to try interrupting them by singing because the singing forces you to breathe deeply ill let you know how it goes seesaw sunnydisposition nike007 i had a bullying former manager who did a number on my self esteem confidence and mental health ever since getting canned i still feel i cant trust my new employer even though he has told me no one is going to do such things i think its because the former employer used to be nice and then she became progressively rude and nasty i could not talk to her as everything i said was dismissed pretty much i had a meltdown in my new bosses office because i thought he was going to fire me i did something wrong but since its probation they can sack you for any reason he said i need to talk to you and i felt sick and wanted to cry cried in his office and shook like a leaf he called me down and said he just wanted to do a thirty day eval and discuss what happened yesterday i feel like an idiot for doing this but it is scary for me my former employer would say i need to talk to you and i would hide for the day because it would be another ruinous everything is your fault and i wonder if you are learning disabled since you dont get it i nearly threw up because she said i need to talk to you i thought she was going fire me there ever since just heating those words sets me off i thought about asking my new boss i do like him he said i was hired for a reason and that everyone is glad to have me aboard if he could just explain he needs to talk to me but say i need to go over your eval or i just need to go over this in the office with you instead of i need to talk to you i kind of feel like thats asking too much but i dont want to have a panic attack in his office over nothing or at all thanks does anyone else feel so much of their anxiety that it turns into a selfhating rage i get so so angry with myself and i snap at people i care about because i get so twisted i want it to stop i try to use meditation or calming music when i can  but sometimes when it actually is happening i cannot stop it what works for you guys i could use some help hey i definitely get angry when im anxious like punching a wall and breaking my knuckles kind of angry what works for me is stress balls and punching soft things i dont know if you have the urge to punch things that might actually be the adhd talking there idk but stress balls are nice my therapist gave me a breathing exercise for anxiety where you put one hand on your chest and the other one on your stomach then breathe it seems kind of silly but it works also people never notice when i do it so i dont get weird looks jesus strange anticipation and anxiety and actions i need to reread your message and translate it into english it reads now as if written in some grand prix speedfest language so just wait now 1 youre recalling your previous manager who bullied you and caused you damaging mental distress 2 you were fired from the job with this manager the bully 3 you have a job with a new employer youve told him about the bullying you suffered because of your previous managers behavior 4 your new employer has assured you that you will not encounter those types of behavior by him in your new environment fuzzy on this one 5 you do not trust your new employer or others in your workplace to refrain from bullying you 6 youre previous manager was was nice to you but over time became rude and nasty and bullying she didnt value your input 7 there is a big hole here 8 you fell apart in your new employers office because you believed that he was going to fire you 9 is this the back story before 8 occurred you made a mistake did something wrong because you are in a probationary setting the new employer can fire you at any time 10 when your employer asked to see you you felt ill and you felt like crying 11 in your employers office you cried and shook 12 your employer calmed you down and told you that he wanted to accomplish a standard project 13 so in a nutshell the words i need to see you in my office makes you very anxious and you would prefer for your employer to give you an idea of why he wants to see you  oh see me about project x by the way i dont see anything wrong in telling your employer about your past experiences and ask him to be a little more specific when he wants to see you are you seeing a doctor now a psychiatrist or therapist you seem to be at the height of anxiety oh  i typed that out way too fast didnt i sorry the takeaway point is i dont want to have a panic attack if my new boss asks to see me i felt stupid about it after he did did say i am way too hard on myself and had confidence issues but other than that was doing fine next time ill see if i can ask if he can be more specific like you said al90 waking up with anxiety in the middle of the night is the worst reading is my go to as a distraction since your building is cold maybe you could keep your hat coat and gloves nearby to stay warm while you read at times i have it where i couldnt stay in bed ill have to try the walking meditation i know that for me the anxiety compounds as i know ill be tired for work which adds stress to the whole thing if its disrupting your life why not take a sleeping pill then you wont wake up means no more anxiety in the middle of the night just a thought i have this problem too i keep my phone with me and restart or start youtube videos there are a lot of soothing things to listen to but what works best for me is talking i like listening to dbt connections but anything will do that is a lecture im interested in they put me right out no matter how much i want to hear the material its normal for me to be anxious about all social stuff and over people im worried about but its getting incredibly insane my stomach is in knots almost every morning now as soon as i wake up ive had feelings of nausea on my worst days which is become more often now these last couple months i cant even eat in public anymore without this feeling whilst im there or without almost having a panic attack as the time for the event draws closer i cant even step outside the house without knots anymore today i even surpassed those levels and threw up without even stepping out the house i also had that knot in my stomach for the majority of today since i awoke i had my boyfriend over today though and his company helped me a lot his hugs and even just his touch never fail to calm down my insides i dont even know why im so anxious most days anymore which really pees me off especially when i tell my boyfriend that i cant think of a particular reasons for the anxiety and it frustrates him a little as he knows there has to be some sort of reason behind it which then makes me feel worse ive had a couple days lately where my hands have even just randomly shook for a little while or ive gotten lightheaded and dizzy for a while my heart is almost always beating harder and faster now too i pretty much cant do anything anymore without anxiety interfering its really annoying and frustrating me i want to escape the anxiety but theres seems to be literally no way i can right now i cant even just simply wake up without anxiety tapping my shoulder and announcing in my ear guess whos back i hate it i hate it i hate it i dont know what to do i thought i could solve this and help myself but its just gradually getting worse every few days or so it turns out i cant do this alone i cant keep living like this especially with the nausea stuff as thats becoming so frequent now i cant let that lead to anything serious possible trigger im still kinda recovering from when i used to starve myself for the majority of last year and the first 6 months or so of this year i dont want to get into that again either on purpose or because of this function rejtgomb tag

thisinnertext   gombvalue  show   i want to be able to eat in public i want to be able to even just roam the shops and buy food without knots in my stomach i want to be free from my anxiety not particularly asking for tips or anything although i may need them actually so please feel free to do so i just needed to get this off my chest somewhere shattered sanity usually my music on my phone and some calm games i have on my ipad help distract me and help my insides calm down but the anxiety has started to just return afterwards congratulations im so happy you have found something to help treat your fear i hope you continue to work on it still if needed hey everyone ive been experiencing really bad anxiety lately and ocd my current ocd symptoms are mainly related to fears of going crazy becoming delusional losing my mind etc over the past couple weeks ill be doing something and suddenly ill get a random fleeting thought that feels like a memory for example i was just cleaning a closet in my house and i picked up my guitar so i could clean under it then suddenly i had this fleeting memory of my mom asking for the guitar case back that she had bought for my sister but let me borrow for my guitar it felt like i suddenly pictured it happening and it had a familiar quality to it like i had simply suddenly remembered it but i realized that this didnt happen and that the actual real event that occurred involved me being thankful at one time that my sister got a new case so my mom wouldnt ask for this guitar case back and i could finally have a case for myself this is happening up to 10 times per day and is triggered by completely random things in my environment i have a million examples of this and wish i could write them all down but it would just be too long of a post these types of experiences have happened once in my past also at a time when i was obsessingworried about losing my mind they were not present intermittently when my obsessions focused on other things now that i am worried about going crazy again they have suddenly reappeared and it scares me because they feel like random bits of real memories even though they usually are not accurate if the memory is too vague or insignificant sometimes i honestly cant even tell if it is an accurate memory or not simply because i dont remember the details of the actual event whenever i get these thoughts they happen so suddenly and i become terrified that i am remembering things that didnt happen and becoming delusional or psychotic and i get so worked up other times i will get sudden dejavulike experiences where ill just have a thought that pops into my head that feels really familiar or ill get a sudden creepy feeling like im about to remember something i dreamed about but then my mind cant quite access the thought and the feeling goes away its very strange and im finding it difficult to not ruminate about this which i think is making it worse ive heard about dejavu like experiences being associated with epilepsy and ive been cleared for that ive also heard about this kind of stuff being associated with the onset of psychosis so naturally im freaking out could this be caused by ocd or anxiety i know nothing of ocd but i was first diagnosed with anxietypanic attacks in 1985 and have been in the care of psychiatrists since that time i am also being treated for psychosis youve a perfect description of racing thoughts i think that when you have the suddensingleepisodes youre experiencing a minipanicattack absent the racing thoughts what you find unusual and frightening is the memory aspect dejavu like experiences of these racing and these sudden thoughts the way that they make you feel you are afraid that the experiences may be psychotic episodes caused by anxiety or ocd i never had a psychotic episode caused by any anxiety disorder i have never heard of anxiety disorder being the cause of psychosis either oh  there is a big difference between a psychotic episode and a delusion i have had similar thoughts though similar events periods the creepy feeling and the feeling of losing your mind going crazy and other terms that you use because i am so wellgifted with so very many other mentalhealth defects though im unable to say if my experiences were strictly anxiety related i assume that you are in therapy if so you should talk to heshe about these occurrences they do seem frightening defyinggravity65 alright the fear of losing your mind is an anxiety symptom textbook example what is unusual is your fear of remembering something that didnt happen a false memory that could lead you to believe yes that youre losing it you have a cycle going on but the basis i think is probably that horrible feeling that you are going to lose your mind at your next thought anxiety psychosis is something that you can get through with the amount of seroquel that i ingest daily im almost psychosis free a way to still talk to your dead friend sitting on the edge of your bed whilst knowing that you are not really talking to him but you dont stop because youve so much new crap to tell him conversely when i have had delusions yes the battle of agincourt is really being reenacted with a kenneth branaugh directing in the empty lots behind my apartment building i do things when i am delusional  i mistake fountain pens for swords and make coffee from tea bags true stories your next thought will not make you crazy i promise you are not going to suddenly flip into madness madness for me took time i think that it takes time for everyone i think that anxiety disorders make us fear a sudden plunge into insanity hmm yeah no so im sticking with anxiety and keeping ocd at bay since i know nothing of it what you describe is certainly anxiety related who prescribes your psych meds if youre not in therapy although i am old school addicted to xanax since 1985 there are some new meds that do a fine job in treating even the worst anxiety seeing your other diagnoses yes here to gad panic disorder and panic attacks a whopping hell yes to agoraphobia i am much better now and a host of social anxieties personality disorders and a fatal case of mortons toe i doubt that your prn lorazepam how much will keep the djinns away talk to your prescriber i hate to sound like a nag but with the agoraphobia and your various social anxieties only one cure  exposure therapy i was stuck in my apartment blackout curtains closed doors locked i would sometimes talk to my caregiver sometimes never say a word if someone showed up at my door  or phoned  my voice would sound croaky and ragged or highpitched like a 12yearold girls my voice was outofpractice i finally started inching my way out the door two friends  one very dear  died as i was making my way out i finally made it outside where the people were at first i could not stop talking but my vocal chords werent up to the task now i am better i have friends very old and very new and i come and go even it was hard i dont know how many times i died in my hallway i would talk myself out of trying if i could not find just the right clothes the diazepams arent going to help get you out they may help with some social anxieties though find the right clothes after that its a snap i wanted to update that today this happened again twice while i was driving i had a memory of my fiance talking about my tires and brakes and later realized that the actual memory was of him talking about his tires and brakes on his truck but i remembered it incorrectly and that bothered me also as i was in a turn lane i had a sudden memory of being with someone else at some point who wasnt in the correct turn lane but turned anyway i cant remember who and dont know if it actually ever happened or if its just a weird deja vu feeling these things cause me a ton of anxiety and im beginning to think of them more as intrusive false memories in a way and they terrify me becsuse as i think of them they come with this feeling of realness more accurately familiarity its so weird and i really dont know whats going on but i have a hunch that if i would stop worrying about it it would stop happening anyone take gab a supplement for anxiety does it help any other supplements that u have found helpful new to this whole anxietypanic thing recently i have been experiencing chest pains im not really sure why maybe im more anxious than normal i am going off medication to switch it it just really hurts a lot let me tell you i have had panic attacks since 1985 i had a major one as christmas eve became christmas morning i have had five heart attacks since my first in 1994 i associate chest pain with panic attacks rather than heart attacks the latter feel much more like a sudden weight upon your chest that stops your breath of course i also keep nitrotabs scattered around like rosaries about the house if i have any chest pains i pop a tab or a second but if the pain continues i get the emts here pdq to check me out and as iris had one stent i have eleven in my heart and one in my right carotid artery plus the large vibrating oh never mind i dont play around with chest pain  honestly no one heart attack was exactly like another do you have a good  and i mean really good  blood pressure cuff and machine i take my bp and check my heart rate as the emts are closing in they usually get here and stay until im calm but sometimes i am scared and i will go to the er for an ekg even if you just hit puberty chest pain should put you on notice that something isnt right you may have swallowed a freefloating jalapeo seed and be suffering from gas you may be having a panic attack you may be suffering from a doubleshot of ischemic heart arrhythmia nativeson complexities you may fart and feel good about yourself again who knows you need to make friends with your local emtfolks next time you feel chest pains okay ps im guessing that minute smidgen of ativan is supposed to ward off all anxiety ailments give me an effing break living with anxiety for so long we all tend to gain considerable insight into how it works and along with that comes an understanding of how we may beat it even if its temporary like for example i use thought reassessment where i come at the same fearful thought from as many positive angles as i can and apply the okhams razor theory which means choosing the answer that makes the most sense and is the simplest explanation so i chose alternative thoughts and make them my reality works for me 5 or 6 out of 10 times thats something right what about you guys what tools have you developed with experience and time spent living in the shadows of anxiety  share it may help someone else one of the tools i love is my fidgit cube i always have a hand in my pocket playing with it before that i would shred klenex in my pocket my hands always move when my anxiety is high i have posted some of my methods in the depression forum hop over and take a look at my threads there im using elements of dbt therapy one of my many tools is to remind myself that this isnt real i know my anxiety is but its a vicious monster that needs me to feed it i have to focus on what i imagine it looks like i focus on its face and i tell it you dont control me i control you think of the movie divergent while she was in the simulator she was able to separate her self mentally hats how i see it i tell myself you arent real i control my feelings i deep breathe and continue to tell myself its temporary ive found the more i wallow and cry and get psychotic and angry i destroy others feelings and make no progress dont feed the bear starve it gl to you all i dont have very many good ways of coping im working in that but one good thing that does help is meditation and deep breathing exercises deep breathing helps me out on the spot sunnydisposition pinkdiva42 windmills718 thesadgirl sometimes i like to interrogate the thought put it in a holding cell and ask it bunch of questions like where were you before why didnt you show up when i was not stressed how come you are just showing up as i am getting ready to enter a stressful situation i keep at it until the thought loses all credibility and power over me lol scheeks scheeks i play with hair ties picking at hems of long sleeve shirts playing with my necklace chain and if i have none of those at my disposal i will resort to either nail biting i know a horrible habit that i almost have conquered now or playing with my hair for me hairties or my necklace work best something about twisting something around my fingers just relaxes me i do a mental count of every time an anxious thought comes a knocking and label it as anxiety so say an anxious thought appears in my consciousness ill call it out as 3  means its the 3 rd thought of the day and then let it go and do whatever its called thought labeling you label the thought and let it go rather than engaging with it this is very effective try it welcome to psych central its not stupid to be afraid of a horror movie if its causing you problems especially i dont really know much about gettting rid of phobias if its causing you serious problems maybe you see a therapist who specializes in phobias there is a certain song that many years ago i heard and some bad stuff happened then i heard the song again and again bad stuff happened i became afraid of the song because every time i hear it i fear that terrible things will happen i really built it up in my mind after years and years of fearing the song i decided that i was tired of fearing it and that the song being connected to bad things was purely coincidental i have decided not to fear the song anymore simply because fearing the song is tiring and pointless like others have said i use deep breathing when it starts to really get to me and calm it with calm thoughts or ill use some form of distraction like chewing on a straw or some other kinds of soft plastic or just go soak in the bathtub close my eyes and dream or listen to what my other selves have on their minds i too sometimes use methods of taking back the power using my gatekeeper personality hell state his title and say im in charge here or if im irritated with it and feeling confident ill say you have no power over me i may even go so far as to tell it i am the one with the power now and you are beneath me sometimes though ill eat or if i have money ill drink some because that calms it and relaxes my brain you hear about so many people getting mean when they drink but its opposite for me my grandfather on my mothers side whom i never knew was like that he was all straight laced and stern and cold and serious but when he drank he was happy and cheerful and danced they say but since i rarely have enough money to make ends meet i dont get to drink much so sorry for getting off topic we now return you to your regularly scheduled program already in progress sunnydisposition as much as i dont want to admit it when im anxious about something fidget spinners kind of help theres just something about feeling it spin so smooth that helps take my mind off of things also sometimes i will use the vape my mom got for me it has 0 nicotine so its all flavor i think it helps me because sometimes in the moment its really hard for me to deep breathe so i guess it kinda forces me to the last thing i do is listen to music there is one band in particular i listen to when i am anxious i have no idea why but their music always calms me down especially if im in the middle of an attack maybe its just because i like their music so much thoughts reframing its a positively revolutionary method in combating anxiety ill give you an example so i had an job interview yesterday im sure you all know how stressful job interviews can be so one day before the interview i started to feel really stressed but the strange thing i noticed was instead of stressful thoughts concerning my interview all my thoughts were pure health anxiety  which is my primary mental health concern so my mind was thinking of all kinds off illness that can and will happen to me scary stuff which i dont want to get into but you get my point the closer i got to the interview time the more my anxiety got riled up and out of all the anxious thoughts none were regarding the interview and job which i noticed so i finally reckoned that this is not health anxiety this is actually job anxiety which became so obvious to me at that point i started thinking the closer i get to the interview the more my health anxiety acts up so the real stressor is the upcoming interview henceforth anytime an anxious thought regarding my health came up i told my mind its just job anxiety masquerading as health anxiety and i moved on my anxiety got very much manageable from that point on coz i started reframing the problem by identifying and tracing the root source of it techniques like cbt are based on rationale and logic ive found that there are times it just doesnt work im gonna try something new using the power of belief an unshakable faith that im gonna be okay deep breaths and repeating these words for those times when rationale and logic fails to tame anxiety key tones some people mentioned techniques where they call out to anxiety and declare thats its not in charge but they are in order to take back the power i just wanted to add that ive read some books of experts been in therapy and the best advice i ever got was never engage with anxious thoughts coz when you engage with them you give them credibility and power which they wouldnt have in the first place if you hadnt engaged with them just a thought let these anxious thoughts drift through seamlessly in and out at most just label them as anxiety but please dont engage with them because the minute you will they will become real hi everyone do you have the feeling to be alone or unwanted when you are with friends or family i find this one of the most annoying feelings with gad i even talked to my friends about this and they are always reassuring me that they want me there with them but the feeling doesnt go away even with medication does anyone know this feeling and how do you cope with that hi yes i do know this feeling i am unsure if this is related to anxiety low self esteem depression or a combination of all three but when im with friends or even talking to friends i feel that i am forcing them to do so because they are good people and just want to be nice im always asking them that they dont need to talk to me if they dont want to or i say that im not worth liking or worth anything they tell me i am all i can really say is to try to tell yourself that your friends do like you if they didnt why would they still be your friends think of all the things youve done together i know this is easier said than done as i struggle with this too hi there i am sorry to hear you struggle with this i cannot relate personally but i know quite a few members can it does not sound like a part of gad though but rather a selfesteem issue i have gad and do not share this struggle have you considered therapy to address the low selfesteem and reassurance seeking behaviours rodzasky i have some phobias like that wikipedia is not my friend at times i usually bring up these things in therapy and we work out a way to make it seem less scary like prolonged exposure or overcoming the fear with cognitive reasoning or imagining something to overpower the fearstuff like that shattered sanity angelique67 not benzos they made it worse in the long run propranolol is the best one for me hoping the mri shines some light on the mystery fharraige health anxiety from a mystery pain is up high on my list of major life disruptors like key tones though ive been anxious about work lately its a decent job but theres almost no security i could literally get an email either tomorrow or in 10 years telling me they have to let me go i take commissions on the side and that is a nice supplemental income but i dont think its enough i have to do a lot more networking which i dont know that im up for anyhow i hope you all are managing okay these days i have had really bad arachnophobia since a young age i believe it was caused by a combination of several bad experiences with a house temporarily invaded by the giant european house spider yes thats a thing and more years of naughty kids realizing i was arachnophobic and trying to toss large spiders into my clothing what fun that was i have read that the best way to deal with phobias is good old graduated exposure and also changing how you see the feared object or event so i took the bull by the horns recently and started binge watching youtube videos made by people who raise tarantulas watching people of all ages playing with six to twelve inch long spiders and going aww its so cute let me tell you something about this awesome species makes you feel a bit silly for ever having been afraid of them the weird thing is i think its actually working ive at least gotten to the point that i enjoy watching these videos now and i can do a google image search of the ugliest most horrifying looking spiders imaginable and not feel any of my usual apprehension if you want to try this yourself heres some advice  watch videos about common jumping spiders first especially peacock spiders theyre so ridiculously cute they are the only species i have never developed a fear of other arachnophobes online often agree theyre the least intimidating arachnid am i ready to raise goliath tarantulas or the super fast rather venomous orange baboon tarantula aka the orange bitey thing lol ehhh  one thing at a time okay but i have to admit im less afraid now and i know the differences between avicularia brachypelma and poecilotheria hey thanks for your replies nike007 i think i do that too seldom telling myself that it is very interesting that it happens only with my best friends since i got out of therapy i kind of started using the strategies i learned less and forgot about them scaredandconfused you could be right i dont know what this feeling is part of i suppose that the self esteem kind of lowered itself through some experiences where the gad had its part i dont know i did have very low self esteem growing up but it did get better i would love that it doesnt ruin my friendships like it did in the past i did go to therapy and learned a lot but it is more than half a year and i forgot to use some of the strategies that i learned nike007 i know the feeling and i just accept it it sucks though always feeling alone or detached from the group i experience this alot where i work and its brought me additional isolation at times which was the last thing i needed i do great with customers though they seem to favor me this has made others jealous and i suffer the consequences then too the boss never sides with me im automatically the bad guy otherwise i do my best to wing it during social situations but i always feel that it is awkward and i like to abort sooner than later its iike i want people in my life but when they are i dont like it sigh im sorry you are experiencing this i can relate i agree that it might be related to something other than gad whatever it is its frustrating and disheartening i talk back when that thought pops up and purposely think something more realistic and positive after enough times doing this youll form new neural pathways that will be more helpful to you best wishes changingmindset changingmindset yes terror management theory wondering if others here have any knowledge of tmt being used in clinical settings im a fan of rankthroughbecker and beyond and i am certain of these things 1 my anxiety is a product of my inability to deal with my overarching fear of death 2 my most natural course to participating in living would be the creative 3 i lack the selfesteem and i doubt my creative abilities sufficient to the task of creating realities 4 i remain in terror outside of any reality manifested by anxiety and panic attacks i have not been able on my own to practice any kind of beckertmt methods of coping my bipolar mania is my only defense mechanism hypersexuality  not risky sexual indiscretions  allows me a lifeaffirming preoccupation to avoid my terror of death we deathobsessed know the feeling of dying as experienced in panic attacks feelings that i guess the tmt fellows would say is within the period of mortality salience i really need to reread worm at the core so tmt anyone thoughts about becker etc death  in any aspect well i dont know anything about terror management theory or rankthroughbecker im afraid this is all way beyond my limited mental capacity at this point what little bit of reading i do nowadays is limited mostly to classical chinese  zen poetry plus ive been trying onoff to work my way through some of the buddhist sutras although these sorely tax my poor mental capacity as well im not really a buddhist though either i guess you might say im a fellow traveler so to speak i dont believe in a god or in any life after death i accept the explanation for the existence of life on earth that is provided by the theory of evolution so for me when youre dead youre dead end of story and ive made a couple of strong bids in that direction the most recent one not all that many years ago now ive read that previous suicide attempts put one at greater risk of making further attempts it tends to break down a persons innate fear of it and i believe thats true based on my own experience however at this point i have no plans to try dispatching myself again im content to just wait it out  let mother nature take her course i just hope mother nature doesnt wait too long otherwise it may come to a point where ill have to give her another little nudge well now the final exit by ones own hand i cannot could not do it last night sometime yesterday i was in an hourslong panic attack death was certain i smoked some weed and calmed down i think i know nothing for certain  does anyone that my fear of nothingness is so severe so critical that i cannot conceive of sending myself into that void it will be someone elses job to see me so dispatched or nature the natural world being darwins i sometimes poke fun at eastern um stuff i am far too ignorant of western civilization to make an attempt at the eastern i fear that time really is running out and it is and although i do not have a bucket list i am so distracted by living now that i am like the moth larvae in a mexican jumping bean  when heated i fly from new york to tokyo nonstop right over the artic back to london for my bespoke clothing well of course practice makes perfect you know i watched harold and maude some months back bud cort and his suicides i think that the very best suicides are as in the movie those that you can walk away from i was supposed to die at 58 wasnt i told in 2003 that checkout was imminent i was my father died at 58 i had my first panic attack on the oneyear anniversary of his death i was supposed to die then in 1985 i am late late for my own death isnt there a joke in that no theres not death isnt the joke the joke is in the living with death ever looming cutting off heads at the next car crash me i am only still moving because others rub up against me now i started young and only stopped rubbing when i was madder than now not a lot out there on tmt but ill keep looking if i could only check it like a hatbox at the terminal i have to keep running i have to stay in motion until im brought down once brought down i will sleep without dreaming or ever waking again boxing day i am feeling really anxious today about nothing in particular just really anxious lots of racing thoughts and screaming from the voices probably contributes to my anxiety though not being in control of whats happening in my head anxiety calmed down through out the day but left me with a lot of depression a few years ago when i was maybe ten or eleven a horror movie came out and i was intrigued by it i decided to look it up and read the synopsis and ever since i have been absolutely terrified by it so much as hearing the name or seeing the cover freaks me out the cover is the main problem it looks just like the shower door at my house when i see the cover to the movie or even just a still or hear the title i cant bring myself to get in the shower i have to get a washcloth and wash myself off that way because im just so terrified i thought i was over it but evidently im not because its happening again this is insane i cant let a stupid movie about human taxidermy rule my life but thats exactly whats happening what can i do about this how can i make myself stop freaking out to such an extreme over something so stupid hi daretoplay  first i have to ask  do u play an instrument  second  movie triggers are very common  a certain scene in a movie ur watching can trigger a ptsd event that has been in hiding to protect you if you have suffered repeated trauma from too many triggers i would suggest seeking out a therapist it might sound scary at first  but believe me  they are there to help i was  and still am  in a bad way for a long time and i decided i wanted to be happy  it had been so long since i was happy  i sought out a therapist  and glad i did it is hard and it is work  mental work  but if you get through it  and u will  you will feel so much better me  i am a work in progress  but trying to like myself i am slowly learning that at the end of the day  liking yourself and being at peace with who you are with total honesty can bring much personal peace like i said  a work in progress all my best and welcome we have some of the greatest people on the web here  and we all want to support and help  anyway we can as i always like to say to someone new  welcome home later  keyplayer daretoplay even though i have nothing interesting to say talk anyways even if you arent feeling confident reach out and interact you never know where a conversation will go i had my first panic attack in over twenty years todayi barely made it out of the grocery store before i broke down im coming off a weekend that the husband and i had another fight this one was about privacy and space he wants to join all the sites and chat groups that i do because he thinks he is missing a part of me that i show to others and not to him he is trying to inject himself in everything i do since he woke up and realized i had been telling him for two years that we were growing apart i knew i was emotional today but i thought keeping busy and running errands would help well i didnt think about the fact that i would possibly have to deal with other people in the store and that was what did it luckily i only had a few items to pick up and was able to breath my way through i read your other thread and the stuff with your husband would drive me nuts i feel for you as for the panic attack i know how much they suck glad you were able to get through it nogoodpoison hi everyone i need some advice and just need to vent kind of to sum it up basically i dont get out much and really want to go for a walk but im too scared to go alone i carry a decent sized pocket knife when i have to go out and plan on buying pepper spray as well i also have another knife in my car still though im so scared that someone is going to attack me or something i dont have any friends i can ask to go or any family thats home during the time i usually want to go i really want a large dog id feel completely safe going if i had one but i already have two dogs unfortunately i dont know any of my neighbors well enough to ask if i could walk their dog either does anybody have any advice weve had dogs for prettymuch all of the 38 years weve been married and for much of that time ive walked whatever dog we had typically a couple of times a day the one we have now is a 15 pound poodle  schnauzer mix hed be about as much protection as a steamed hotdog where we live now feels pretty safe at least as safe as anywhere is nowadays but for many years we lived in the heart of the twin cities and that never felt particularly safe although in retrospect i guess it was pretty good too the primary problem we had was with loose aggressive dogs so i always carried dog repellant and i had occasion to use it more than once i dont know about the knife idea sadly my impression is that when people carry something like that its more likely to be wrestled away from them  used on them than it is to end up being protective i dont know what type of community you live in obviously but my thinking would be that perhaps there are other people similar to yourself living in your neighborhood who would also like to have a walking companion so my thought would be to get the word out that youd like to find one or more walking companions  see if you cant find some you could perhaps talk to friends  neighbors even though you dont know them that well you wouldnt be asking to walk their dogs or anything like that you could also perhaps contact any community service or neighborhood associations in your area stuff like that you could perhaps even organize a walking club so to speak beyond that perhaps its primarily a matter of getting used to being outside walking start out just going as short a distance as youre comfortable with if thats only ten feet from your door then its only ten feet then each day try to go just a little bit further this is basically the idea behind what is referred to as exposure therapy family therapist kati morton has a video on the topic of exposure therapy on her youtube channel heres a link to that video ughhhhhhave to make a phone call tomorrow about getting the car fixed theres a problem with it thats been getting worse and my boyfriend found a recall that was done that should address the issue but i have to call because its my car and in my name etc i hate having to make calls like this they make me so anxious health anxiety continues daughter came down and talked to us about a pain in her back she has a curved spine and one hip higher than the other like me i just hope its a strained muscle and nothing worse hope she remembers to make a doctors appt except when i have to deal with the checkers at the local grocery store i try to avoid anyone i dont trust anyone anymore ive turned distant withdrawing into myself if someone were to do something as simple as even ask me the time i freak out i am in fear that people want to hurt me this is hell this is too much for me i hate bad environments were people are doing drugs  drinking to stupidity i hate gangs they hang out right outside the back of the bldg i live in with their stupid altar vigil going on one month burning little candles right on the property to their dead homey ill be blunt i dont care live by the gun die by it i just avoid it but those losers have people actually watch over the altarvigil thing how stupid isnt that what churches are for or peoples private homes oh and ill be more blunt if your uncomfortable than i suggest that you might go to another forum how come another ethnic minority i wont say which one why is it they call me a n rhymes with jigger when im light skinned  these losers are almost the same complexion they get treated with racism seems like blacks s should band together i guess that theyve aligned themselves with the aryan nation or something its dangerous being a black woman in 21st century america think im over exaggerating well do your research i know what im talking about in los angeles county blacks are killed for sport and ill leave it at that i really dont like this country if i could id go to hawaii fiji brazil after the horrible incident that happened to me on dec 13th by the psycho neighbor  other traumatic incidents i just dont view people the same anymore what a horrible world i live in in los angeles county blacks are killed for sport i didnt know that but find it disgusting i mean why hugs ljj7000 its understandable as to why you would feel this way it sounds like you have been through out a lot so it would make sense that you dont trust anyone  and yes the world is a terrible place sometimes and it can be very scary especially for minorities but the world can also be a great place to live in remember it takes one person to make a difference it may be scary now but take baby steps and treat yourself with care when you make progress towards your goal you should praise yourself for it i dont know you but i am rooting for you 3 mavriforcek9r i am soooo friggin angry right now i could spit nails my partner has no concept at

praying he makes it to christmas but if hes ready to go we wont let him suffer i am not even given the status of step parentso i have zero sayso im expected to just shut my mouth and except the way things are im going crazy i cannot talk to my partner and talking to a therapist at this time is too expensiveso im ventingthanks hello i really need to describe my experience here because i am not even sure if its valid not sure what is going on to be honest so here it goes about a year ago i had a cancer scare it turned out to be nothing the tumor i had was benign however it took so much time to diagnoze it and to rule out cancer months doctors even started preparing me that its cancer well it turned out to be benign at first i was happy but soon i started experiencing anxiety like i am not myself not completley i got easily irritated and full of anxieties and paranoia the fears not really connected to this but more related to my selfesteem or general anxiety etc i talked to a councelor last year and he told me that this is normal and that it will pass well one year later and i am still feeling off like i am still recovering from this trauma i am still anxious and getting paranoid and on the edge it even affects my relationship with my husband he is also feeling really stressed about the whole thing because it hurt him the health scare a lot and it affects him too so here we are more than a year full of anxieties like we just cant catch a break any mild annoyance and problem in life seems so big and stressful now so we are constantly feeling on the edge and all of that for nothing i mean i am healthy i should be happy right i know that rationally but i still feel off and like i am still recovering from the trauma not sure what to do thank you for reading this just like multiple octobers before i am becoming hypervigilant and listless suddenly everything fun in my life matters less every year this happens ive done every conceivable thing to combat seasonal depression but i dont think that is the issue i think its just a pattern of anxiety that my body responds to once the temperatures start to drop october is otherwise my favorite time of year  i am determined though not to just let the winter steamroll me again this year i need to take better care of myself and so far i have been so theres that jennifer 1967 anonymous50013 im sending love and hugs my body seems to respond to autumn with increased depression and anxiety as well i look forward to the cooler temperatures and the beautiful autumn colours though oh smallnorth  i am so so familiar with this ive had two very similar episodes of suspected cancers that turned out to be nothing tests professional speculation preparation waiting andnothing then months and months of being on edge i really hope other people chime in here because there are a lot of directions this incident can take you now some people do get over it eventually and things do return to normal but these types of things shake our very foundations and a lot of us have our brains rewired after something like this life doesnt feel so safe anymore and part of the everyday anxiety is this vague feeling that anything at any moment can pop up and throw our lives back into chaos i hope i am not making this worse im trying to get the point across that sometimes these things do awaken a dormant disorder in us and it takes more than just time to heal i dont know what the next logical step will be for you but i feel like there should be more dialogue now between you and a counselor or therapist or whomever you can manage to talk with in this field i spent many years believing that sooner or later i would go back to normal so i didnt do anything about what was becoming a growing problem with anxiety i am doing better now with some various forms of therapy but i could have saved a number of years if i recognized this earlier good luck i really hope this doesnt sound catastrophic there is hope i promise

like i am still recovering from the trauma to the validity i can speak yes it is i had serious back surgery last august  was told there was a chance i wouldnt wake up had to do with involved blood vessels so anxiety reared its head  understandable so wellobviously that didnt happen in fact the surgery was amazingly successful beyond what was considered possible during the month of inpatient care they kept me on the med got home stopped meds  the anxiety was still there only worse have an appointment w doc to find out whats going on a nurse friend suggested a possible medical reasonamygdala dysfunction long explanation so may want to research but it has to do with a brain chemical that may have gotten out of whack cuz of not only the mental stress but the physical stress of surgery thats all i kind of know so ill be following smallnorth anxiety is high today a lot of this weeks agenda that is worrysome exams meet my new therapist and meet my new aide caelix3 had a doc appointment today he is going to do some tests looking for a physical cause he said anxiety symptoms can be the result of excess thyroid hormone hormone imbalance often happens after surgeryhe says

i should be happy right i know that rationally but i still feel off and like i am still recovering from the trauma not sure what to do thank you for reading this quote i am terrified of the shower  no shower in almost 30 days  just sponge baths etc any one else out there with this awful phobia i do have a fear of showering but its manageable at the moment i use a 200 watt big yellow old school light bulb in my shower coz yellow light is soothing and it drives away the damp dark cold feel that dwells in the bathroom without it it also emits heat so thats an added benefit kind of like my own little sun in the bathroom next thing i do is exercise before showering nothing big just brisk half an hour walk does the trick it warms up the body so i stop feeling the chilly cold feel anymore every part of the body gets warmed up and then i can undress for shower knowing that i wont feel as much cold as i would have without the exercise i keep the water nice and warm and stored in plenty for as much as i need to use i wash with a gentle rinse of the loofah and lastly i always tell myself that whatever thoughts fearful or not come into my mind are just bathroom anxiety and i dont have to give them any second look and let them drift through me seamlessly i shower in the evening or at night when i know that i dont have to leave the house after so i can wrap my self in a warm blanket and immerse myself in the flow of the day hope some of it helps you hope it gets easier on you soon take care does the showering ordeal apply to rainfall when your outside how about using a bucket of water to bathe would that be the same as showering with you i have body issues and sometimes when i am under the shower i just want it over quickly so i can just put away my ugly body i also have a fear that if other women are about i am a woman myself i cant shower but thats okay because in most sinarios if not all i am home alone anyway mavriforcek9r resumed from anxiety daily checkin point 3  page 2  forums at psych central im feeling anxiety and i really need relief i guess i could have a cogentin it still isnt clear that the pharmacy will get my rx for me today i seriously need the prescription today oh god im so scared they seemed very certain they could fill the rx when i talked to them yesterday im just so afraid im sure its going to turn out just fine youll get your prescription filled today just like they told you try not to worry about that sending healing thoughts when i think about my therapist i feel anxious i miss her i didnt see her this week maybe thats why also since this is a therapy service offered by my university when ill finish uni and that is soon on february ill have to stop seeing her i think so this hurt me a bit because i think ill miss her even more i wish i could stay more plus i feel the same problems are with me everyday i need therapy angelique67 having some panic this afternoon this is even with the artane which im about to run out of not sure what the deal is i was a little anxious about an interaction with my boss but i think its ok we have a weird relationship and i want to make it better hopefully she agrees sunnydisposition my anxiety was much more bearable today i did get my meds yesterday and things seem more manageable i think i am prone to situations where something related to me like my prescriptions is not in my hands and i have to rely on other people thats probably what it is had a great day decided to be very busy so i wouldnt have time to think and it helped pretty excited to do the same tomorrow yeah sounds like everyone on this thread is doing well awesome im okay too verity81 soooo anxious about all the work i have to do for universityugh what if i cant complete it what if i dont pass its doing my head in dowdythefifth i felt very anxious this morning and in the afternoon because my father screamed and argued all day with my mother i was very tense stayed in my room wanted to cut myself badly even if i promised to myself i wont do big cuts anymore then at some point the anxiety passed i felt anxious again for some minutes this evening i had to write my thoughts on my diary so i can show to my therapist i saved some thoughts i had on my phone so i only had to copied it on my diary i suddendly felt anxious a weight was on my chest when i took the diary because the diary made me think about my therapist im really afraid she doesnt like me and that she want to reject me i really think this was the reason for my anxiety i felt like i could panicked at any moment it was a huge anxiety i felt a weight on me i thought about hurting myself again instead i copied the thoughts on the diary then i drew a tree on a page and pressed hard the pen on the page then i drew causal lines to calm myself then put the diary away sat on my bed closed my eyes and breathed like i do when i meditate i tried to relax all my muscles and smiled a bit to relax the muscles on my face i counted my breaths after some breaths i started to feel less anxious until the anxiety passed and was tolerable for me now im really proud of myself years ago i would have hurt myself without thinking acting on the impulse to not feel my emotions instead i chose to feel my emotions and to accept them as they are they arent bad or negative and they come and go they will always pass like clouds in the sky another quiet day i didnt panic today made dinner and helped clean tomorrow will be busy pdoc t and picking up meds im in denial i can feel it physically even this was how i felt just before my best friend died its like a room where everything is covered by sheets of murky transparent vinyl its all tucked away for some future date when my emotions thaw it scares me was an ok but not great day dealing with some feelings that are going to make my life unpleasant until they pass but i think theyre the source of my extra anxiety of late knowing about them does make things more likely to be fixed i hope im wondering about this really awful rls ive been suffering lately just nothing helps it maybe an ativan will i guess ill try it out now angelique67 i had to do some stuff outside my house for my mother groceries go to the pharmacist and i really didnt want to go because i felt too self conscious and anxious then i decided to go out and not avoid and i didnt felt so much anxious rough day husband was concerned about my a1c being up and told the pdoc i had changed my meds the meds arent the reason she put me on one that had one of the least amount of chances for problems then he clogged up the garbage disposal even after i told him putting that many potato peelings would do so my calmness has been spiked with anger my anxiety can go up when im angry just trying to take deep breaths now feeling extra whatever today boss hired a new guy and shes fawning and flirting with that guy so much right now the rest of us are  in her eyes lately her husband gets my sympathy so i have to listen to her cackle all day with this guy and it makes my anxiety go through the roof i really am thinking that quitting is the best option and they just gave me added responsibilities so id be walking away from a pretty good deal if i didnt feel like i was just garbage in my boss eyes i work there too and my career is going to go in the dumper without some help or input from her so yeah my day has sucked and now im worried about whats going to happen verity81 i went to my doctors appointment in spite of the heavy snow falling the doc was good and didnt give me the spiel about diet exercise and losing weight the hospital here has a diabetes eduction class so ill probably do that next month i also got a referral for an acupuncturist to see if they can relieve the pain in my back had a long wait for the diabetes med and almost hit another car on the snowy ride home traffic is backing up everywhere so its good to be home everybody was in good spirits so my anxiety stayed somewhat down i went out to do some things at the post office wasnt anxious maybe because i went out yesterday too and it was familiar for me plus people didnt care about me yesterday so today i was less self conscious i hope i can get some calmness back after days of anxiety tomorrow i plan to go to the library during my lunch hour it is peaceful to be immersed in a row of books i have to go out in an hour and go to the bank which is a place that makes me very anxious then ill go to a bookshop to buy a gift for my sister and this makes me anxious because im afraid the shop will be full of people watching me i was anxious earlier because their were meant to be some christmas carol singers heading this way and i didnt want them to stop at my door not that i dont like christmas carols people just make me anxious anyway the point is that they ended up not coming and it made me feel instantly better that i didnt have to possibly open my door to strangers did two loads of laundry and got my hair done im always anxious when i go to the hairdresser because my husband doesnt go in with me i trust the stylist enough so i dont panic but i feel uncomfortable it is only 10 am and i can hear fireworks i know they arnt their but even though i keep telling myself that i can still here them urg you just dont get fireworks on cold rainy mornings in december unlesss youre me and youre just ed up dowdythefifth i spent all morning picking up meds and medical supplies have to order cpap supplies thursday a lot of waiting with a lot of people thankfully my husband was there so i didnt get too anxious still have more meds to pick up but it may have to wait until next year a little anxious this morning before work daytime is rough but am less anxious than yesterday at this time even though its wednesday i am a little anxious about sunday christmas day all this abandonment and being alone gonna cause problems went to pick up another med another 1 hours in the waiting room my fault though because i forgot the prescription yesterday other than that not much going on still nervous this afternoon im so anxious this morning ive gotten into this bad habit of only picking up my mail maybe once a week well its been more like 2 weeks now and i know i need to get it but since its been so long im really anxious about checking what i have had physical therapy and got the information to the sleep doctor so i can get my cpap supplies now its two days of waiting with nothing to do ughthis is when my anxiety gets really bad ive been doing okay but made the bad mistake of looking at the news today now im freaked out about nuclear war im scared for the future more dread today it comes in small bursts right now like getting your clothes snagged on some thorny bushes i can handle it for nowi just dont want to be enveloped completely was a mostly good day until this evening when i checked my work email got a less than warm response to my well wishes to my boss not mean just very meh i worry way too much about what she thinks of me and i wish i could stop at this point it feels so dysfunctional to deal with her everything else in life is generally pretty good but i catch her in an off moment which happen fairly often and my mood goes in the toilet and i spend the next day worrying constantly about it and how i can improve things really i dont think they can be but my mind races today is gonna be pretty challenging theres so much going on lately and the physical symptoms that anxiety is causing me have only gotten worse in the past few days i only managed to get 3 hours of sleep last night which is not helping ive been lying in bed for the past 2 hours but i really need to get up and start doing things soon my stomach hurts i want today to be over already i went with my father to shop for christmas dinner groceries thank goodness i wasnt alone we went at 7am and entered a relatively empty store but the crowd punched through the enterance behind us and i could just feel the tension of the whole store rise from the masses of stressed out shoppers thank goodness we got out but not before i witnessed a woman yelling at a clerk because they were out of the brand of cocktail sauce she wanted and two men arguing over placement in line it was bloody awful whew i got out of there relatively intact did a load of laundry and made dinner in the slow cooker other than that a quiet day my husband took my daughter to work cars were streaming outside of the mall trying to get in my daughter is not doing well emotionally and shes in a busy section of the department store i hope shell be okay tonight and tomorrow going to make cinnamon rolls in the morning and do our christmas dinner tomorrow night she is going to spend christmas with her boyfriends family which is fine with us i am quite anxious today  my cbt tools and decatastrophizing work is not helping in fact my catastrophic thinking has only gotten worse my daughter is making the drive out for the holiday it is a 7hr trip at the best of times but road conditions are crappy what with a blizzard yesterday and more snow to come all kinds of bad thoughts are going through my mind i slept terribly when i catastrophize this badly i envisage such distasters quite vividly i have seen in my mind images of her going off the road etc will it blizzard again does she have adequate tires on her car will she have an emergency kit including that for cold weather etc etc etc i know logically i shouldnt have my shirt in a knot its not like she is a kid anymore she is a big girl 29 and capable of making the right decision living where she lives she will have had plenty of winter driving experience regardless however i shall have my heart in my throat the entire day my holiday wont start until i get that call she has safely arrived im doing pretty well despite being broke for the next four days money is often a trigger for me so i chalk it up to having low stress in other areas of my life at the moment having some time off work is doing me good had a good christmas my husband surprised me so i have one less item on my wish list i have to save up some money for the last item and some accessories spent most of today puttering around i didnt get the usual midday anxiety so thats good however my daughters boyfriends mother made a bunch of sweets and i cant really have any because of diabetes so they need to go away somehow angelique67 angelique67 im very sad about some things but my anxiety has been very manageable the last week or so had a bit of a situation today but i was able to handle it also got a bit freaked out over some things that people did and said but was able to stop myself from getting too deep into it having less stress and some time off work and things to look forward to and just acknowledging that its okay to just breathe for a while has helped ive felt more calm and less depressed than i have been in a while i just want to say im grateful for all the brief check ins lately ive been very down and anxious and this thread is one of my safe places i feel comforted just knowing thee are others struggling like me i hope the best for you all im getting a new camera next week itll work with all the lenses i have my daughter is getting the old one as it is still in good condition plus some accessories i picked up for free hope i get to use it more next year i went to physical therapy this afternoon my back is put in traction for 20 minutes to relieve the pressure on the lower part of it i would be doing the exercises but i hurt my left shoulder blade at some point and its still very painful im doing alright anxietywise but i still need to drive and walk out on my own i havent done that yet plus i need to make some dietexercise plans because of diabetes still have a lot to be nervous about next year tend to feel jittery the start of a new year think its because i have relapsed so many times over the last few years i always thinkwill this year be the year i lose my  again today the big whamo of a crisis in my life has become no more my tests came back normal all my stress and worry of the last 13 weeks has been lifted from my shoulders and replaced with a sudden wave of relief and exhaustion dread i wish i could growl it away took down the outside decorations and the small tree in my home office i didnt want to take it down so soon but temps are supposed to drop below freezing in a few days ive been nursing a sinus headache that meds wont touch anxiety has been pretty low but i took a nap so i havent been up much the holiday took a pummeling to me my health crisis took a turn and was further dumped on by an infectiion keeping me in the emergency 11 hours boxing day followed by a ct scan on the 29th then my boyfriends daughter had a brain biopsy and was placed in a coma the 30th if that wasnt enough i find out now my father had a stroke on hte 31st when will this nonsense end anxiety is about the same today as most other days just kind of there in the background but not so much on the surface verity81 i always feel ashamed of myself when anxiety hits im kind of out of it today things seemed to be unreal like im walking through life as a specter did go out today to take a family member to get groceries and to one of his friends houses and got some take out ive felt like there has been someone following me all day and i had to make sure no one was in the car that wasnt supposed to be there before i got in myself not really all that anxious or depressed today just feeling transparent and a little paranoid started back at work today after a little time off and noticed right away how much my anxiety is tied to my job i kept it in the background and hope it stays that way this week had my teeth cleaned today im doing the best i can but its not good enough still waiting for my cameraits supposed to be in today anxiety is cruising right along being at the dentist always makes me nervous anxiety is running high today but ive managed to control it a bit more than usual it is easier to deal with when im taking care of someone later i might have issue but right now im as good as i get im doing okay had physical therapy today and that went well still figuring out the camerathat will probably take a while had to update my medical id tags to add diabetes to the list anxiety is down so thats good where to start i am worried i am anxious i am depressed i am frazzled i am dissapointed resentful and agnry is the lithium withdrawal contributing i am irritable easily aggrivated and annoyed yes i have numerous very significant stressors in my life only one of which is my physical health to work me up these things if disclosed would be obviously extremely concerning to onlookers except apparently to my boyfriend i am quite sure others would acknowledge these situations and even validate my worry is understandable and expected despite the added situation of tapering off my lithium as adding to it all i think i am managing well i doubt even the average person would be able to cope i am hanging on i feel by a thread have three weeks of no physical therapy kind of nervous because my back started hurting again today had it on a heating pad for a couple of hours i hate to think this is going to fall apart had to go to the supermarket to pick up some food for the next couple of days i was fine until i got there i spent thirty minuets in the van and then another twenty minuets standing beside the drink machines before i could go in side went to the bathroom to calm down about half way through the trip and then finished up i tend to eat when im stressed and i ate too many potato wedges i feel like such a fatty surprisingly i feeling pretty good today last night was kind of a mess but today im pretty calm today was kinda of tense day maybe because i was tired i tend to overthink more when i am tired hoping the rest of the week is better i signed up for an online creative writing course im going to pick up poetry again since i can do that with all the diagnoses and such im going to see what im doing right and go on from there i may take some college courses and see if i can find a group of writers for mentorship and peer review did well the past few nights because i was with my friend but im back home and unable to sleep again texted my local helpline and talked to a very sweet girl and i feel better though still have a headache bless the volunteers there especially the late night ones i appreciate it so much that there are people willing to spend their 2 am counseling people for free it was a challenging day yesterday and it will be the same for today but i won some hard battles against anxiety yesterday i was able to attend and sit through a meeting ive been stressing about for weeks i was able to give my psychiatrist a form ive been panicking about giving him for near two months i was able to call my doctor about test results i stood up to the cable company thus far this morning ive finally made a few calls i have been putting off i was able to allow the cable guy into my home without freaking out and i had the courage to speak up to my boyfriend telling him i thought he was hurtful and inconsiderate whew oddist121 learned how to use the blood glucose meter it still hurts and my meds got increased because my blood sugar was too high rather frustrating i didnt sleep well last night so i ended up taking a nap this afternoon im still tired and i need to stick myself again before dinner ugh im really struggling today im seeing my therapist for the first time after the holidays in an hour and im feeling so anxious the past 3 days were especially tough ive been constantly using selfdestructive behaviors because i can not cope with feeling like this but the truth is i only made things worse im trying to keep calm and take care of myself but i feel like im going to break down at any minute i just took 05 mg of lorazepam and im having a glass of warm milk i need to pull myself together quickly did grocery shopping and went to a meal planning class i was sort of anxious for both events but managed to get through them i picked up some yoga equipment i need more flexibility and i figure this would help ive also had phone anxiety but only when having to talk to strangers  my anxiety has really been taking over the last few monthssaw new p yesterday  have restarted my buspar  will continue my propranolol im glad that i feel strong enough to start fighting it again instead of letting it continue to control my life today has been a decent day for me had to go out and do some errands and stuff but its all good today was an off day for me had tension headache at work was better when i got home thank god tommorow is friday went to the emergency room tonight after looking up my symptoms they didnt help with my reason for going just set up a therapy appointment after we went through the questionnaire do u feel safe any thoughts of suicide blah blah im hoping that my symptoms are anxiety related so much ive had scares like this before but what if its for real this time didnt get much sleep last night but did get up at a normalish timeabout 11am so thats a start another slow day i didnt do much i got my acrylic nails taken off since i wont be able to afford that anymore that was rather nervewracking other than that i ate and slept finishing up laundry here in a few and need to make dinner good solid daydid lots of physical stuff which kept me out of my head a day without anxiety is a good day indeed hi guys just got back from an embarrassing night lately i have been having a lot of worries about my upcoming dream trip and meeting with my girl crush during this trip being ruined by some brand new mental illness however this fear has been slightly more controlled though i did have a lot of other rocd obsessions about not loving my girl crush or falling out of love with her well lately the closer i get to my trip the more i worry that everything will be ok and i have been quite worried about ocd well tonight i had a dinner with my class at university but a bit before that i started to feel a bit sick i thought it was from the anxiety brought on by the obsessions then later on it persisted but i could still function then at some point after drinking one glass i started to feel more anxious and the fact that i was more anxious after drinking led me to having a bit of an anxiety attack then i really thought i was going to throw up which led me to panicking even more being emetophobic didnt help with this situation either i eventually ended up throwing up at some point in front of nearly everyone now i am quite worried and defeated if ocd really caused this then i am truly screwed  there really is no hope left for me i have learned to manage most of my symptoms through the 4 steps from brain lock but obsessive fears that are based on possible future scenarios are difficult to get rid of hello dannii thanks for sharing your experience honestly i dont know the answer to this but i wanted to at least acknowledge your post im not a mental health professional but anxiety is certainly something ive struggled with for many years and based on my own experiences it is my perspective that anxiety has a tendency to build on itself first you start to worry about something and moremore things get added to it then prettysoon youre worrying about the fact that youre worrying it can lead to the sort of thing you experienced i believe so it makes perfect sense to me from my own nonprofessional perspective that what you experienced was at least primarily the result of anxiety it may also be a red flag so to speak with regard to alcohol consumption assuming that is what you drank its difficult to say perhaps your anxiety would have caused you to throw up anyway its difficult to know anyway from what you wrote it sounds to me as though youve mostly just worked yourself up into a heightened state of anxiety over your upcoming trip perhaps sharing some of your nervousness  apprehension with your girl crush might help to alleviate some of your anxiety talking it through with someone else such as a trusted friend or your therapist if you have one may help too got to put on my brave face and go out today im a little anxious for my day to begin i hope it is a good day i hope yall have a good day too im curious about how many of you share this with me my anxiety causes me to do things and act a certain way one of those things is refusal to talk on the phone i would much rather text someone or hit up a chat roombecause typing is easier for me however when it comes to talking on the phonea lot of the time i will hit the ignore button on my cellphone and text the person asking them what they want i will hit the ignore button and not text that person at all i will let my work phone ring and refuse to answer it and when worse comes to worseif i absolutely have to talk on the phone i begin to stutter or my voice shakes my anxiety with phones began when i was a little kid i used to have a weird phobia of being woken up in the middle of the night to the house phone ringing and the answering machine picking it up i dont understand why i had that phobia i remember i would hold my fingers in my ears and cry until it stopped dont ask my why i was afraid of phones when i was a kid because to this day i still dont get it caelix3 i have phone anxiety i cant even order pizza only very recently have i been tackling it i will never be a phone person but i want to at least be able to answer it and make appointments i have a hard time making calls this is a new development i wasnt always scared i hate talking on the phone as well my anxiety goes up everytime a family member calls me unexpectedly i wind up having to call them back because then i feel like i can handle it better same as thesadgirl i cannot do stuff like ordering pizza so i always order it online ironically right after i posted my comment some random number is calling me i have been getting a lot of random calls recently and have not answered a single one i remember a random number called me i answered it and a guy said hello mamthis is the  police department would you like to make a donation i was freaking out because i didnt know cops called asking for donations i said sure then he said which package would you like to pick there was a goldsilver and copper one i believe i said gold he said that will be 150 what is your credit card number i panicked and hung up i felt guilty afterwards i have really bad anxiety about unknown numbers calling me my paranoia goes crazy i have it too i often choke when talking to a stranger ive read that this fear comes from the fear of making a mistake the more we will practice and make mistakes learn from them and repeat the process the better we will get at it think of your next phone conversation as an opportunity to practice and learn i guarantee you will feel less anxious do that for every call and you will overcome this fear thats my take on it could it be that the avitan actually has helped and is just kicking in i felt miserable around an hour ago cast good sense into the wind took one and now i feel almost as good as a kpin could make me although i possibly have more anxiety now or maybe the anxiety just wasnt helped by this pill i dont know what to say now whatever it is its maybe 5 to 10 of what a kpin could do for me anxiety is running high no sleep tonight didnt do too bad had some anxiety but was with my spouse so we worked through it i want to crawl into a deep dark silent place and cry cant get out of bed need to force myself to take a walk and get some kind of exercise and need to eat something but wverything feels disgusting quiet day still ruminating about the future need to stop still anxious somewhat yet a huge relief and release exhausted planned meals and got groceries for the next couple of weeks took a nap with my husband not much else anxiety was tolerable going to the supermarket can shut me down sometimes am seeing my new psychiatrist today am very anxious so much for that wave of relief anxiety is washing over me again the information i got from my family doctor did not reflect the latest results and thus was incomplete i have it too i hate talking on the phone if i have to make a phone call i go to a room where nobody is in and make sure there is no sound so i dont have to worry about having a hard time hearing i much rather text somebody i have a hard time responding to any kind of communication in general from anyone besides like my mom i worry so much about how my response will be taken that it keeps me from responding in a timely fashion i am working on it though learning to overcome my fear seesaw uneasy  a little edgy today and i dont really want to go out but looks like im going to have to make a grocery run did a load of laundry and wrote another poem im going for at least one poem a day anxiety was up but i managed a nap so it passed took the cats to the vet today routine checkup and one had her teeth cleaned theyre none too happy but theyre healthy other than that wrote some poetry and surfed the web anxiety is here but not as bad as previously im not doing so well lately im trying to keep myself busy during the day and ive accomplished a few tasks i feel proud of this week but im finding it extremely hard not to isolate myself i get so anxious when im around people and i dont even want to talk with my friends it takes me several days to text them back and i spend hours thinking about the fact that i need to text them even if i dont which only makes me more anxious im isolated and anxious it was a rough day couldnt help cleaning because of my back which made me feel worthless i did well on dinner though no anxiety today which was great taking my meds like clockwork  trying to stick to a daily schedule i really want to text the hotline but i texted them two nights in a row already  my friend insisted on picking me up after therapy this evening i have a difficult session coming and i wanted to be alone and clear up my mind but shes going to be busy these days and she tried to make some time for me so i couldnt say no plus i cancelled going out for dinner with her the other day because it felt like a huge challenge i felt better after cancelling it but now i feel like im being ungreatful its gonna be long day and im really anxious about the appointment with my therapist i wanted to be home early today but it seems like its not gonna happen i have to be really careful with my anxiety leves at night time so i only hope i can manage to end the day in a good way now im just trying to keep myself busy so i dont think about it too much i find it hard to take naps because then i cant sleep at night i have to admit i take them anyway because im soo tired from my meds i am sitting here with my anxiety going through the roof i needed to get rid of my clunker of a car maybe i could have sold it but my anxiety would never allow me to give strange people my phone number and address so i am taking the miserable token fee the wrecker has offered and now await his arrival i cant help but think this is going to go badly my catastrophic thinking is getting the better of me why am i so blanketyblank afraid of this wrote some poetry and took a shower husband is making dinner tonight i like being able to switch around as cooking is stressful to me other than that my anxiety is up and im not doing much i felt blue and super anxious earlier but after a nap i feel a little better had a pretty alright day i was able to eat in fact i think i overate nowim feeling the consequences with heartburn on top of my normal anxiety stomach aches before bed but trying to stay calm since the stomach aches trigger the anxiety a lot gonna try not to bother anybody about it tonight not my friends not my mom not the hopeline and just meditate or something helped my husband patch a hole in the roof watching him going up and down the ladder was scary as hell hope this works at least until we can replace the roof still trying to calm down from that experience at least hes safe now i am struggling today yesterday i had a terrible anxiety attack i was seriously afraid my heart would fail it was over a situation i knew full well i need not be afraid of but my catastrophic thinking got the better of me i retreated to my apartment and hid in my bedroom for hours afterwards today i nearly had one again i had to make a difficult phonecall one necessitating i stand up for myself in a likely confrontation and that it did come to oh how confident i must have sounded with my voice trembling an octave higher and barely able to hold the phone i cried and i cried once the call came to an end in a release of all the fear still will there be retaliation it never ends i hate this i hate this anxiety i hate this illness went to a park and took pictures it was rather nice came home had lunch and the anxiety started up i was late to take my meds and im still quivering couldnt focus on anything so came to pc need to start forcing myself to spend time with friends and leave my room when im at home i just wanna be alone but its making people think i dont like them or care about them or whatever processed some photos from yesterday went for a walk at another park its so warm for january still having anxiety dont see my pdoc until next month see t tomorrow though my anxiety has been high lately my ex is taking me back to court and it has me anxious and angry she will keep pulling this crap for years im afraid anxiety is a little bad again i do have ativan currently but im trying not to get in the habit of taking it just for run of the mill anxiety im still up in the air with getting the gabapentin refill they are refusing me the refill until only god knows whenwhy im getting angrier and angrier this was why i forced myself and my wonderful friend to that lousy clinic 15 weeks ago so i could get the refill but no they had to ditch me both of them and still not refill my prescription and now the weather is freezing rain or hail and i still havent got it can i remind them that i have emphysema and dont want to risk getting sick does that even matter i hate their guts i would like to possible trigger make them as sick as i am and then see if those scum still wont fill the prescription function rejtgomb tag

them my latest worry i am concerned that he may lose his job it would seem his overwhelming anxiety and depression resulting from all the worries of his own is affecting his performance he told me he has been getting coaching conversations lately i am doing my best to be supportive as ive mentioned over and over but my catastrophic thinking is kecking in i am procrastinating one of my worksheets to deal with this was kept up all night with racing thoughts so i didnt have that good of a day i did get four poems out though so that was a plus didnt work on my pictures and only got one load of laundry done hopefully will be better tomorrow i dont want to go to town tomorrow but looks like im going to have to go really sucks because i dont like all the traffic or the people really really dont wont to go grocery shopping i can kinda do okay to the first of the month on raman noodles and kool aid but everyone else is so  picky ive been extremely anxious since yesterday i feel like im choking shaking and about to vomit any second i wish i could unexist until this passes its 9 am right now where i am im waiting for a reasonable hour to call my doctor ive been on sertraline for 2 weeks and this is the first time ive felt so bad since i started using it i feel terrified i got reasons to worry like everyone does but i feel i wont be able to handle them anymore i feel overwhelmed by responsibilities and uncertainties this may sound stupid but my anxiety elevated because of the kittens in out buildings yard ive been feeding them getting them spayed looking after them for a few days at home and then putting them back to the yard this was going smoothly until the cats made a habit of entering the building and pooping whenever they cant find a way out the janitor took them and left them somewhere unsafe in a moment of rage before but i was able to bring them back and inform the neighbors so that they wont let the cats inside but still some people invite them in and the same thing happens last night the janitor came and complained and demanded that id do something about it i think i handled it pretty well i offered to put cat litter somewhere in case they are trapped inside the apartment the janitor accepted my offer but still i feel like they are gonna be taken any moment and i wont be able to help them i got the rest of the laundry done today but not much else anxiety is walloping me only eked out one poem i think i put it in the creative corner still havent worked on photos my t saw my poetry site and left a compliment guess that means its therapyapproved then i still have not received my script for gabapentin its approaching a bad time because ill be out of the emergency pills the pharmacy gave me i just hope ill have excellent luck tomorrow anxiety is beginning to mount i had been doing better in the past few weeks but now im struggling again im back at taking ativan small doses 34 times a day and its come to a point where its not working anymore i called my pdoc today and now im waiting for her to call me back so we can set an appt and talk about this i dont know everything feels overwhelming lately wait wait wait the game continues today could be a pivotal day this week could be a big week my lease is up in a matter of days and ive yet to hear from my property manager will they drop in my lap a rent increase what would the implications be for my eligibility for my benefits what about my ct scan assuming my results were in when my specilist returned to her office on monday and assuming the woman again infuriatingly has sent me results by mail i could receive that correspondence as early as today i wont hold out hope i am waiting for a cheque from the wrecker for the car i had dragged to the lot will he follow through on his quote and what of my military disability application will my psychiatrist finally have completed the questionnaire will he confirm that the assualts ptsd and harrassments contributed to my mental illness sigh i really wish i could try some medication for my anxiety and panic attacks my doctor flatout refused last time i asked about it things are tough at the moment  i wake up very early in the morning having a panic attack and it is so horrible it makes studying so difficult and i wish i could have a better hold on this going to keep going though gymnastics helps to quiet my mind my daughter went to the er last night they think she may have an ulcer which wouldnt be surprising she has anxiety and depression shes on meds for 5 days and hopefully shell pull through if she doesnt then she needs to see a gi specialist finished processing my photos and up them up on flickr i did a different take since there arent that many birds squirrels and chipmunks there were turtles though and that was quite a surprise spent the entire day in bed other than to walk downstairs to get food to bring back to my bed and eat there this is pathetic i am anxious about my daughters mental health my back was one spastic knot of pain this morning spent most of the day with a heating pad on it my daughter is doing better on the meds and her boyfriend just bought a car theyre at school now been in too much pain to be anxious today couldnt even take a nap omg i called the help line and poured out my feelings about having no job or future and the girl really told me to go join the military then she started debating me about donald trump and how great he is because i said im worried about whats gonna happen to my family who are on obamacare some people shouldnt be allowed to volunteer id really better start getting up before 8am i have things coming up and for some reason i cant even get up lately again woke up from crazy dreams feeling really anxious took me a while to get out of bed and go downstairs to face the day thank god the feeling lessened and i managed to do a bit of studying my exam is on monday so could be why i am feeling so jittery didnt do much today back still hurting im seeing my doc and pt tuesday so i hope to hold out until then other than that writing more poetry and surfing the web im starting to get anxious now that the weekend is almost over i should be hearing from my dr monday about my thyroid test im really hoping theres a problem with it but i dont feel like thats very likely anymore back is feeling betterdidnt bend as much yesterday posted a lot of poetry to my wordpress site wrote a couple more my daughter is following along doing a drawing a day i dont know if shes posting hers or not whatever its keeping us going making tacos tonight something quick and easy that everyone enjoys didnt do much today besides walking outside i feel a bit uncomfortable that im feeling hot and i know that is because of stress and tomorrow is my birthday been mostly having a good few days i start therapy again next month had a weird moment but im calming down gonna try some mindfulness i have to remember my friends birthday tomorrow i keep forgetting every important thing and i need to make myself take walks okay this post is weird bye well i am still not recovered last night i experienced a really bad anxiety attack the physical symptoms were so strong i nearly went to the emergency room this was building i think since friday i went to a large function and found myself in a situation of sensory overload sounds sights even smells and a crowded situation i could not escape from battered me emotionally i couldnt get away worry over some undercurrents in my life over the weekend added to the build up of angst last night i was taken to dinner it was one of those very busy restaurants where you stand in a very long crowded line too much was going on  crying infants unsupervised misbehaving children teenagers playing the crotch grab game intoxicated college students and several people having a disturbing racist conversation finally we sat down but the crowd noises and specifically the inability to anticipate peoples behavior took its toll i ate two bites of my food before asking to leave i had to escape i was dropped off home and immediately went for a lie down i woke up with my mind running amok and my heart pounding so hard i was afraid it would burst or have an attack i thought i might die sorry to hear that justafriend306 happy birthday made08 typical slow day woke up early to get lab work done only to find out that the doctor didnt put in the order so we will discuss this tomorrow went to t didnt discuss much other than a book im reading want to get my t to read it other than that the usual i slept through lunch wrote a poem about my childhood threw up last night so i missed my friends birthday dont know from what but i feel fine now had a bad panic episode about it thinking it had to be an allergic reaction but i dont think it was really want to go to my friends house tomorrow but im afraid of being contagious to her still after 2 days my sister caught what i had and threw up too so i dont know so much better but still a bit edgy of all the things that ive been waiting on that have caused so much anxiety these last few months i received another good news item in yesterdays mail my parathyroids are good  no surgery i am down to waiting on one matter that is giving me serious grief i still have to hear from my property manager i felt like i am going to have a panic attack all day its all building up and stuff but not really happening horrible feeling all is revealed managed to sleep better the last couple of nights so feeling a little more rested the no sleeping thing really wears me out i think ive accepted the reality of what happened it still feels really strange and a little surreal especially being at the doctors the other day i am afraid i wont be able to handle it all i have to remember to take it one day at a time otherwise ill go mad got my hair cut and colored looks very good came straight home and made dinner that worked out well other than that the usual anxiety seems to be building its very dark in my place due to the lights fading i hope theyll stay on until my friend can be here to install fresh bulbs but other than that i have free falling anxiety i just remembered i took an ativan earlier today  thats why i napped i guess  went to pt this afternoon have appointments with dermatology and the dentist made lunch and will be making dinner in a little while wrote a couple more poems and added one to the creative corner couldnt nap because of pt and lunch im still anxious but took some meds to hopefully knock it down i hate this midday anxiety super anxious about the next couple of days but grateful i dont have to do the driving thank goodness looking forward to it being behind us and back at home i had a panic attack yesterday and ended up throwing up i missed my meds not doing that again went to church today after a year of not going it was good met up with my neighbor and the pastor was great to see them took a long nap still feel tired did feel some anxiety but not much ive been trying really hard to manage my anxiety over politics lately im hoping the new meds will help theres a big tight ball in my stomach that never unknots itself im hoping for it to go away and let me breathe again ive been frazzled a lot on my mind most not very serious all outside my control went to pdoc shes giving me vitamin e for possible tardive dyskinesia before she increases my artane went for a walk at a local park feels more like spring than winter was tired because i didnt sleep well so i missed t will still see him next week had some anxiety so i took another vistaril seems to help the anxiety paralyzes me it can be anything last week the mail piled up because i couldnt bring myself to open it not even the junk mail there is nothing to fear about the mail i can pay my bills im not expecting bad news when i was able to force myself to open the mail the effort exhausted me god i went into the music store today to ask about violin rentals and my voice wouldnt come out right i knew what i had to say but ended up coming out like d do yuooou guyss uh do the uhhmhm violin rental things at here or something the poor lady who had to talk to me oh my god probably thought i was so weird i sounded like i was about to cry the whole time im so sick of this  if i could just talk normally i would have a lot less anxiety but i know wvery time i go up to the cash register or something and my throat starts tightening up im about say somehing like uuhh uhh uh can i ggget a ccccoooffeeee or nothing will come out and i will make some horrible voice cracking noise since ive been revisiting cbt via a guided journal of assignments it has been getting easier for me i still have the anxious thoughts like catastrophic thinking but i am beginning to challenge and strategize wins against them went to pt today 20 minutes of traction my back feels fine the recumbent stationary bike came in pretty neat now need the yoga stuff i didnt feel well most of today so i slept a lot still pretty tired anxiety was down but i was down as well actually it has improved a great deal since i started to revisit cbt i suppose i had fallen off of the daily homework since the program was completed i found a great cbt journal im on week 2 which is full of daily assignments that is renewing the strategies and coping skills i had shelved away the journal includes tasks guided writings selfassessments and worksheets now i admit having already gone through the therapy program it is easier to complete these assignments as i am in the right mindset to do so and am out of choice and not because i ought to anxiety a lot better now that the last two days are behind me anxiety is sky high today im making some major decisions and cannot stop thinking if im making the right ones did 3 loads of laundry today anxiety was up and couldnt take a nap you wont be judged i promise everyone is ed up everyone has their own flaws no one is going to overlook their own just to judge you for yours i think im mentally stuck in 6th grade when it comes to guys because i left public school in 6th grade from the anxiety and live with only girls every time i have to talk to a guy my age i get so flustered and confused i dont even find them attractive just wanna get the hell out because i have no idea what to say or do around them when i go to the cash register and its a guy its like i was on a nature walk and suddenly came face to face with a grizzly bear like do i stay still do i run is it hungry lol gotta get through tomorrow and i hope i will be feeling better after that took daughter to an indoor aquarium for her birthday yesterday i had some anxiety but got through it she had a lot of fun today was quiet went to pt and picked a roasted chicken for meat got anxious inside the home office so came out to the living room instead not sure what ill do tomorrow so i suffer from anxiety and depression with ptsd fall is the worst time of year for me and like clockwork i fell in a dark hole in september sad seasonal affective disorder has long been a problem my dr and i upped my meds the end of september and about four weeks ago i noticed how calm i am so now im worried about how calm i am and heres why i was promoted at work over the summer and have a lot more responsibility i now have just under 100 people indirectly reporting to me i should be doing a million things but i tend to do as little as possible throughout the day somedays just surfing the net and reading posts on here my motivation is shot i know the sensible answer is to lower my meds but i want to hold off until after the holidays now keep in mind that i was having serious self harmingsuicide thoughts just a couple months ago so i need to find a balance where i have a little edge to push me at work anyone else experience something like this hugs sometimes too much meds can have a flat effect when i dont feel anything i found that a seasonal light i forgot what its actually called is useful but i cant do too much because of bipolar 10 minutes a day is good enough my meds were upped too but im now groggy during the day and have insomnia at night i have a job interview in the morning which is good because its a lot of people my age and i will have responsibility but its also bad because its a lot of people my age and i will have responsibilty went to t and did some grocery shopping wrote a poem tried another book for learning one of my programs tried to napdidnt happen hard time focusing because of the anxiety almost missed my afternoon meds going to make dinner here shortly daughter is home all week so i need to plan my meals accordingly for the last three days my anxiety has been sky high i cannot do anything without having some sort of anxiety attack which makes me in a state of continuous irritation which in turn causes me headache caelix3 nammu we made pumpkin pancakes for breakfast i got surprised with a card and flowers i went to pt for my back had a small lunch and then went to a nature reserve took quite a few pictures came home and awaiting dinner my husband is roasting cornish game hens yum anxiety was up and i almost didnt go outside today i took my meds late because of breakfast but im starting to calm down now i went out although its cold i swear i didnt know where i was walking i was just looking at my feet i didnt look at any one in the face now i feel worse than before i went out picked up most of my meds today two wont be available until next week but i should be okay wrote a poem about it had a temporary crown put in this afternoon will get the permanent one in a week and a half felt like the dentist was going to drill all day thank goodness i was numbed up right now im resting kids are making dinner tonight thats cool i am having problems staying in my home office i dont know why im feeling anxious in there i have that interview in the morning im just thinking of sll the ways it might go wrong and how im gonna look stupid and ugly trying to make myself sleep but imagining things exploding or catching on fire while im sleeping also afraid to talk anout it because of the fear of talking things into existence but im trying to get past it therefore posting about it the couselor im seeing is starting to get on my nerves giving me worksheets to fill out i just want to talk had pt again today the tech said half my body weight which is a lot of tension put up cooked breakfast sausage and picked the game hens from valentines day i have two cups of meat so thats good went to another park with a waterfall it was running this time so ill have some cool pictures going to make dinner in a bit had some anxiety when we went out but it diminished with the exercise struggling with anxiety and resentment in regards to trying to maintain a clean home trying to be perfect im so overwhelmed right now i almost want to cry my heart is racing feeling on the verge of a panic attack i try and i try and my son just destroys it all i havent seen a clean home in years i have my license and have been driving for over a decade but a while back some trauma busted into my life and my anxiety went through the roof and i found myself unable to drive for over 8 months i would sit in the passenger seat as my husband would drive me and i would have panic attacks and feel like i was about to die it was horrible i did some counseling and started driving myself to the store that is in our town and small things like that and little by little i would stretch out the distance until i could drive whenever where ever with no issues so hang in there and keep increasing the distance just by a few blocks each time but i think it would be wise if you got your license first in case there were ever an accident or you got pulled over but stay strong and youll get there good luck getting your drivers license i agree with gradually building up to driving longer distances it hit me big time today that you dont have to feel confident to take action i am not 100 sure why but i seem to operate under the illusion that you have to feel confident before you can act with confidence big mistake thats not how things work this is a component of anxiety avoidant behavior such as procrastinating for me feel the fear and do it anyway is a good mantra avoiding things out of fear of failure embarrassment wasted effort whatever leads to a lack of experience what does more experience give a person confidence eventually becoming more competent at something comes from repeated practice and observing what works for you becoming competent increases confidence that sounds good i was nervous bringing it up last night but i confronted my brother about one of his strange rules that he put in place a few years back that i feel is a violation of my rights i also dropped the i with him and called ourselves we because it the truth and im tired of hiding it i dont care anymore if he doesnt want to hear it or shakes his head about it as though it makes no sense im the sufferer and have a right to refer to myselves as we are after all these decades its finally coming out im becoming assertive and you know what i like it it doesnt just feel good it feels right i agree with you vibrating obsidian been having a lot of anxiety lately i am considering telling people about my mental health issues but am reluctant because of the stigma 88butterfly88 i woke up in a good mood and did chores in the morning but in the afternoon i felt anxiety come on and off and now im just trying to relax i went to t but cut it short because of the anxiety came home and took an extra vistaril to calm down i hate it when that happens i ended sleeping part of the afternoon managed to wrangle out another poem at least i can make dinner tonight i hope went to pt and dermatology for the rosacea on my face the pa gave me some creme to get the redness to go down and listed some otc products i can use also picked up a couple of meds the latuda may not be in until tomorrow but the pharmacy tech said they will call me had anxiety again so i took more vistaril its not really helping i may have to take more neurontin or artane well see i feel really shaky inside and im restless which is often one of the signs that im really anxious but it isnt something stupid im just really worried rough day today ended up with anxiety attack so i just laid down and rested didnt get much done need to take shower and make dinner i may ask my husband to pick up something instead i have had high anxiety today mostly about my health and not finding a job had anxiety again today i thought being out and about would help but no it didnt took some more vistaril and am trying to calm down im okay for nowlets see how ill do at worklast night was awfuli forgot the keys for my work and felt like a failurestill dotbh had anxiety this afternoon started when h came back from his pdoc tried to sleep but couldnt i did manage t this morning and did write three poems starting dinner soon but kids wont be home until later tonight anxiety is high for no apparent reason i couldnt concentrate while reading something to improve my skills i just realized how serious my anxiety has been propranalolclonazepam combo works great really slows you down well i went for my job orientation today and then the person who was supposed to help me suddenly left so i had to sit there for an hour feeling weird until a new manager showed up when the place opened but after that my coworkers seem nice even though intimidating im trying to just live in the moment and stop worrying about the future or analyzing everything that im doing idk the point of this post hope everybodys doing well trying to sleep and i start imagining im underwater and that theres a huge fish swimming towards me anxiety is improving i still get super high anxiety but it comes and goes my anxiety basically has its highs and lows previously it was stuck for months at the peak much of this was circumstantial some of it was catastrophically thinking everything in my life some of this i think was just being in a general mood of anxiety to begin with im not sure what changed perhaps it is the cbt journalling selfhelp book i began a month ago i certainly have a better outlook however when those periods of anxiety do hit they are pretty debilitating i feel like i have a molten ball of wax in my a gut and im very twitchy today i cant even point to any one reason why i feel this way today its not like i have to go anywhere or be around people about the only thing i am worried about is going to my support group tomorrow night 1 i dont much enjoy it since the dynamic has changed 2 it is in a not very nice part of town and i hate coming fromtowaiting for the bus the stop is midway between a hooker stroll and a shelter in the dark 3 it is effing cold out 4 i am not one of the popular crowd at the meeting listening to the incrowd discuss what they have done the previous week together and making plans for the following is not only hurtful but downright rude i feel so bad about myself at these meetings they arent any longer the most supportive so why do i go i go there because someone has to be supportive to the rest of the unpopular crowd i feel as though i am needed some of them turn to me for some sense of leadership took more vistaril than usual to get through the day had pt and a new crown put in thank goodness i told the dentist to numb that part of my mouth even with the anesthetic i was in quite a bit of pain i wrote two poems and worked on getting my photo printer set up right deletedduplicate post my rls isnt too bad right now but im not able to sleep yet i want to but im too wakeful the rls has gotten worse since it always does later at night i wish i had been able to fall asleep sooner but i still dont think i can i hope you manage to sleep not slept at all this week almost making it another whole week without sleeping today was quiet trying to get my photo printer to print right and its rather annoying i also wrote a poem for my online class but for the most part ive been asleep i missed marinating the chicken for dinner so i have to think of something else my anxiety was up even with the extra vistaril so i took a nap rather bummed out overall really overthinking starting the job tomorrow im gonna have to make so many first impressions it is peaking pretty high right now ive had a wonderful relatively anxiety free few weeks lately but today it shot through the roof recent circumstances will likely result in the rent going up i can barely justify where it is now not anxious this morning because i just woke up every morning i am hopeful that ill be productive and then it almost never happens and i get anxious and sometimes have panic attacks i feel good about today though matbell my husband and i went to his presurgery appt he wanted it done as soon as possible it means i have to be able to drive soon and i cant get him out of his man cave to do that had anxiety at midday so kept doing errands through it tried to take a nap but couldnt starting dinner soonit should be pretty quick also got jury duty notice handed the paperwork over so pdoc can write an excusal letter alright i finished my first shift everyone was really nice even though i kept messing up and didnt talk that much i think this is going to be okay my anxiety peaked yesterday with some serious catastrophic thinking the property manager is adding some seriously needed security to the building exterior doors of course the first thing that i jump to immediate conclusions about is that this will result in a rent increase aewga the alarm is sounding off like a klaxon in my head i have done some cbt work on this and the panic is subsiding to what i will call a raised level of concern lynn p moderate today feels bad but i know how much worse it can be too many things swirling around in there to choose from i think i will feel a little better if i get to the laundrymat went to pt and picked up test strips for my glucose meter ive been taking more vistaril to keep the anxiety down it seems to help wrote a couple of poems and trying to generate more making dinner in about an hour very high anxiety with a headache  went to church this morning basically read and tried to sleep this afternoon dont know whats going on yet will be making dinner shortly still anxious had t and physical therapy today we discussed various things in t but i dont remember much of it just floating like a butterfly on various topics my t is happy that my creative spark is coming back but it takes a lot of work to write a poem every day theres not much else the physical therapist can do for my back i see my pcm next month so i may ask for pain management again i only have problems when i bend now so at least theres some improvement he ordered xrays and a mri on my back though i started working in my web design program again i have a call with a friend tomorrow i may ask her for help with my web site after i upgrade it i dont think she can help me with selfpublishing my poetry and i really would like some more insight maybe go back to school and learn some things i dont know i didnt have much anxiety today so that was good shattered sanity justafriend306 my anxiety has been stable these last few weeks oh i still have peaks but for the most part it has levelled off and not been constantly high today though is one of those sudden peaks it is a whiteout today with powerful winds and frigid temperatures i have one errand in particular that i am afraid that if i dont take care of it that it will cause me some trouble i realise i am overly concerned about it but my thinking is black and white it is so bad out there however that the news is pleading with people to stay inside i take a bus talked to my friend and we have some good ideas i felt anxious after the call though i have to add a blog to my web site im okay writing poetry but i dont write a lot for a blog other than that not much happened been working with my web site program for most of the day realizing that im doomed to be unhappy forever hate any form of work i know thats like a baby thing to say but its true any job no matter how fun or easy it is feels like im trapped there i already hate my new job even though theres nothing wrong with it and everyone is so nice and laid back i hate the idea of having to be somewhere under someones eye for 6 hours a day i wonder if i got a real job if i would feel different but i dont see the point in getting my ged and going to college with the money i dont have if im gonna feel the same way idk went to pick up meds including the ativan for my mri next week thats going to be fun at least ill be in the tube for a halfhour it was too nice to clean house today and itll be too cold tomorrow to go outside so were cleaning the house tomorrow we went to a park we go to a lot all the critters were out so we took a lot of pictures will hopefully be done with them tomorrow or saturday depending on how much cleaning we do my daughters boyfriend has a cold so hopefully we all dont get sick soon anxiety started early this morning had to take some vistaril to calm down thankfully i didnt need more later today my anxiety is through the roof today too much family drama and not enough calm bed bugs yes these are always a concern for me a few years ago my building had them and it took two months to fully eradicate it is something constantly on my mind as since then ive had the practise each morning of checking for bites and scrutinising my mattresses my anxiety is spiking right now as a pest control vehicle is sitting parked in front of the building across the street i am in abject fear right now that these effing things will march on over across the street another spike to my anxiety i have a function to go to this weekend for my boyfriends group i have trouble with names and faces i am terror stricken by the idea someone will start talking to me and i have no clue who they are after 2 12 years i cant very well ask them to remind me or their name i dont know why im so anxious today though its pretty obvious its because of my new job i really cant find anything negative about it and i already know most of the people who work there and were all close everything should be perfect but its not did a lot of housecleaning today the house needed it when you have two people pursuing their passions the house takes a hit went to see my pastor today he gave me leads for a couple of volunteering opportunities so i appreciated that we also chatted for a while which was nice started feeling anxious around noon but i had an errand to do so i focused on that hopefully i wont have jury duty my anxiety has been really bad the last few weeks i keep over thinking things getting stressed and upset at what i think the outcome will beat the people involved my grandmother is very sick im the only grandchild out of six that comes to visit i keep thinking shes going to die and my sister and cousins will show up at her funeral then i effing snap on them didnt finish cleaning  husband was sick but i put my last batch of pics up on flickr and sent in a poem for my churchs quarterly magazine waiting to see how the latter goes going to make dinner soon hopefully everybody will be able to eat nobody has been feeling good today had anxiety at midday as usual rested for a couple of hours until it passed im so tired of this feeling anxious today have to write my boss an email on monday and i keep ruminating over something she saidarghhh why do we have to overthink so

high as it has been in months our eldest son is currently delusional and it has me on edge we live in another state but i am still concerned that he will find a way here and hurt us he has a history of violence when his thoughts get this way which adds to my anxiety i am afraid that he is either going to hurt us or himself i pray not and i pray that my anxiety level will drop a bit because i hate

effects the past 2 months had periods of feeling better but this past week i stumbled hard ive had a panic attack every day the last 3 days i was able to get into mybpcp yesterday and he switched me from the buspar which has clearly not been working to paxil and he renewed my script for xanax in the meantime i barely alept last night and am just so tired im really hoping the paxil provides me some relief the last few days have not been good i usually respond with anxiety to specific events or situations but of late i have just been anxious in general i have woken up anxious with a sense of impending doom which lasts throughout the day i have gone to bed early just to be rid of the horrible sensation i cant sit still i cant remain in one place i cant stop trembling i am afraid something

because she is toxic and angry will be there and i have a lot of anxiety about that for the last 710 days i have been experiencing a great deal of anxiety but it is like none i have gone through before until now my anxiety seems to be in response to some impending situation or event usually it is either catastrophic in nature or pertaining to my self worth but this last week or so i am just generally plain anxious all the time i wake up anxious  about what i do not know i am frazzled throughout the day the anxiety makes it difficult to concentrate i cant even sit still i pace about my home and go from one activity to another with no reason the feeling is so unpleasant i have been crawling into bed early just so i dont have to experience the discomfort of it what the heck is this went out to lunch with part of my family for my brothers birthday was really anxious going into it but had a really good time was it because everyone was on their best behavior or because i had a huge pina colada with a side shot of rum rarely drink we may never know quiet day today did two loads of laundry and the kids took a bag of my old stuff to goodwill i wrote a poem and marinated the chicken for dinner tonight i finally remembered will be cooking that soon most of the day though was spent shopping online i hate it when i buy clothes because i usually dont stop until i run out of money its

the traumas feeling hopeful still having this problem hopefully my psychiatrist can figure out the best medication combination to help my anxiety and depression looking forward to the brighter days

thing and im helpless on that whenever i get anxious like now i just cant reach for a klonopin because nobody will prescribe it for me except maybe ip i took a benedryl and that helped some to calm me down unorthodox but hey you do what you gotta do tomorrow morning i go to the gym so that aughtta do some good for the endorphins and im going out to bday lunch with my mom both of ours and i got her

medication for anxietyright now i take lorazepam which works well during the day i cannot use this medication due to the sleepiness it causes if i may ask what medications work well for anxiety other

going to my acupuncturist sometimes i do better then others anxious about getting my chores and errands done overwhelmed good morning all during an anxiety attack has anyone ever experienced a fear of losing your mind i get edgy hyperactive and feel the need to escape somewhere maybe i am losing my mind hmmm pinkrose got through church okay had some anxiety afterwards but its more of a rebound anxiety than anything took my meds and chilled out for a while pinkrose1958 ive had that feeling it was that or i was going to have a heart attack chest pain is one of my first symptoms daughter got home from her senior prom at 430 am and just woke up has an attitude and just being plain nasty because i dont want to go out with her to ihop for pancakes feel anxious right now really dont feel like dealing with her moodiness right now yes anxiety is visiting me once more slightly anxious have to get something done today that seems utterly overwhelming to me i will just take it in small steps is starting to sink in now that my friend will be having her surgery soon scared for her i recently had a very anxious situation in which i was with a group of people when one started saying and acting upon sexual harassment she went on to sexually assault our restaurant server he was humiliated by her actions so was i i pleaded silently for someone to say something this was the bosss wife which is why i am sure nothing was done i was so incredibly anxious she then went on to include in her offensive behaviour a disgusting racist and islamaphobic rant about new canadians i somehow found the strength to finally speak up the best i could do was crack a joke about she herself being an immigrant she wasnt pleased gosh what a difficult dinner this was but the anxiety hasnt stopped there i spent the rest of the weekend worrying about what might happen to my boyfriend as a result of my making a nervous joke it was the bosss wife after all no anxiety this morning even though i have a full day i feel optimistic about today ok thanks jennifer i definitely will do that i had this too when i came off medication it doesnt last forever i take geodon it works pretty good im expecting a phone call which has my anxiety turned up to 100 we went on vacation with some friends a couple of weeks ago which completely exhausted me way too much social interactions so lately ive been wanting to sit at home and be left alone no visitors no phone calls no texts but i have no reason to go to the office today so im working from home and have to make phone calls its too easy to want to not be working when im home but since im not making money right now theres no reason to waste the money to drive to work ill just sit around there anyway went to t and the dentist today t was good the dentist not so much if i could have chocolate i would but i cant so i wont obviously i had some anxiety but i missed my afternoon meds and its too late to take them now just trying to keep calm so i can make dinner and be okay another slow anxietyriddled day havent done anything so need to focus on something ive felt anxious all day today ive hardly been able to do anything other than lay on my couch and worry about every problem my brain could make up i hate days like this i dont see my t for a few weeks so i think that is making things worse my daughter is at her dads house and i talked to her via phone she said she had some things happening in her life and sounded so sad it broke my heart and made me experience anxiety many times my moods are impacted by hers does this make me a caring mom or codependent i just try to solve all her problems im anxious and sad so i spoke to my friend yesterday the 1 whos going to have the surgery friday she seemed okay about it yesterday and when i asked why she thought that is she just said  today is a good day im glad she was okay knowing she was calm helped me feel better too no anxiety right now but im sure it will come as i tackle my overwhelming chore dechandawa constantly anxious and depressed but still using cbt and dbt to challenge a lot of my anxious thoughts the depression is more a feeling state that i think comes from being too stressed all the time im not on medication so tackling anxiety from a cognitive and behavioral stance is imperative i have to forge on with the cbt work dbt offers many coping techniques for anxiety but one has to diligently apply them for them to be effective anxious this morning i need to contact my caretaker to rat out my neighbour it needs to be done i dont like to rock the boat see above been a quiet day today took a shower did two loads of laundry reading my poetry textbook for class in a couple of weeks pretty good book but expensive anxiety returned at around 1 pm ate too much food i see the diabetes nurse tomorrow so i hope i can get my med increased the increase will also take care of some of the craving anxiety will always be a part of my existence i will go on with hope although often i do not know why still feeling pretty anxious after the loss of my dad but ive managed it better today than i have in almost a week sorry for your loss brooke went to final diabetes education class they didnt check the meters so ill do that with my regular doc tomorrow got anxious and then almost fell asleep came home trying to shake off the anxiety it finally went down after a couple of hours starting dinner soon and feeding the cats daughter goes to work at 5 pm ugh anxiety level nonexisitant no anxiety totally relaxed right now finishing masters degree court battles for hubby to get contact with his daughter my stepdaughter money worries and im pregnant to say im overwhelmed is an understatement went to hospital for followup with doctor she didnt like that my blood sugar was dropping so she lowered my metformin waited for an hour at the base pharmacy for that also got a referral to the neurosurgeon for the bulging discs in my back im tired of having pain when i

the sleep doctor and played out beautifully my anxiety seems out of control this morning i cant focus at work and i have a deadline next week i also feel pressure from all directions work home myselfi hope it is just an overreaction and that i can handle this hopeful you will find something that works feeling restless is never nice it really isnt hugs picked up refills and made an appointment for the neurosurgeon other than that its been a quiet day anxiety at midday im looking through med side effects to see if there is a med im taking that is causing the drop in blood sugar i havent found it

me on the hotline dont know what to do anxious today had plans and appointments but cancelled them trying not to go into full on panic mode i have some transitions occurring in my life that are unnerving me after weeks of anxiety that was no more than a small blip on the radar i find myself today with it quite elevated i am concerned about a woman who keeps hitting cars during her attempts to park i feel the need to be vigilantly watching out the window so as to run down with a note to leave on the other cars should she do so yet again three times in a day and a half i also need to call my optometrists office to obtain my information so as i can order my eyeglasses elsewhere i am afraid of a confrontation for some reason my anxiety is incredibly high this morning i know ive been stressed for a while but there really isnt anything going on right now that would be causing more anxiety than usual but i keep feeling like a panic attack is on its way someone keeps knocking on the door everytime i go to the bathroom i dont know whos doing it i need to know details of things always do you think this is an anxiety thing or a personality traitinterest have always been like this needing to know what do you think been up and down today some of it is circumstantial went to t this morning and that was alright mostly talked about school and our anniversary yesterday the owner of the roofing company came and said our roof was installed wrong by the builder somehow im not surprised but it means we cant use insurance to pay for the roof good thing we got that loan just trying to chill out now while waiting to make dinner in a few hours husband has a dry socket again and an infection so will have to watch what i cook for the next few days my anxiety has continued to rise i

software made the bed worked on photos the kids have to work and start school again so mothers day dinner is postponed until thursday i feel like stiff and sore and like a pile of slimy goo if it

what i normally take at thanksgiving christmas and for easter ive had panic attacks but this time i was calm i hope this progress remains between my daughter working and our familys celebration i only

nurses station and i can only use them in the very controlling system here ive been feeling very little anxiety for the past several days my daughter even shared something pretty heavy with me last night and i took it in stride slowly making progress turned in my work for class started some small chat with the other students its easier from home because i can think things out a little bit my teacher is probably going to have a field day with my homework but oh well still having a hard time calming down mowers are out today so kind of antsy making dinner in about an hour or so feel some anxiety because of my daughters graduation friday i feel like i have a lot to do in very little time and there is the emotional factor im irritated and snapping at everyone milder anxiety most of the day i have had overall less anxiety the days when my tank is working when its not i get really agitated but for the most part im getting through it and maybe theyll let me leave after a month one of my former colleagues died sunday of a heart attack my husband and i talked quite a bit about this and took in some comfort food for breakfast i also got my hair done this afternoon i feel better

down with meds im still antsy i didnt sleep well so i woke up late had just enough time for breakfast before my husband left for class im starting to have a headache i dont really want to feel this way ive had a few anxiety attacks today one that was real pronounced was when i was about to go to a pizza hut to pick up an order i had placed as soon as i got outside and started my car and got in i started feeling the hyperventilation isssues my diaphragm was getting tense but i surely wasnt breathing too fast i know for sure it got worse as i arrived and was waiting for my order to get done when i got home and inside my hyperventilation feeling slowly dissipated another real pronounced but more like it was a full blown panicanxiety attack was when i got a phone call from the receptionist from my counselor saying my appointment was cancelled because my insurance wont cover more than 2 visits per week im still in panic over that im still having the pins n needles feeling in my arms amandabroken you wont be judged i havent found that to be my experience at all the people have been kind understanding and supportive if someone is on the off chance being negative you can ignore them and you wont see their post anymore sending big hugs i havent checked in for a while ive been keeping things somewhat manageable except today and it is really quite silly i was seated in my coffee shop next to a fellow eating his noodle bowl why in the cafe i couldnt figure out slurping sucking inhaling for some reason this caused me a great deal of anxiety i havent figured it out the trigger but no sooner did i get up and walk out than the emotion subsided gethprime1977 here it is 537 in the morning and ive been up since 3 i feel anxious about madisons graduation anxiety about all i have

things will go well hope everyone is doing ok glad to hear it jennifer anxious today but not as much as usual i guess this is baseline anxiety that im having here my social anxiety has me almost mute here too like my roommate its like being a nun in a convent except they dont have 24 hours days of being around people and there are more men here i think than women 3 pannic attacks in 1 week agoraphobia is really kicking my but shall we say jennifer 1967 update i got my prn refilled and took a couple ive slept all day since im so worn out by this morning dodgersmom jennifer 1967 finished homework for this week and two out of three loads of laundry are done went to one of the local parks this morning and saw a chipmunk and hummingbird im glad to see the hummingbird since we set out our feeder and havent seen any yet anxiety came around noon so laid down until 3 pm i missed my afternoon meds im not feeling that great and i still have to make dinner i just wish i could crawl back into bed i had absolute hell getting off kpin ive mentioned that before but since maybe november or december the pdoc at the clinic prescribed me ativan it doesnt feel the same as the kpin not really much relief but then as circumstances would have it ive been given i think 5 kpin per day since the hospital and here at the rehab nursing home too i could ask for them to not give me it but then id feel even worse so ill just take it and if i ever get back home i can taper myself off at my own pace with the ativan if its helping you i agree with the others take it tell your pdoc that you need a very long taper and direct them to the ashton manual good luck raspberry anxiety just is went to my nieces graduation today and a big celebration party no anxiety or panic thats a big step for me did have waterworks yesterday wondering if i would be able to do it yay i succeeded hope everyone is doing ok a tad bit anxious today i have other things going on maybe my anxiety would be a whole lot worse i agreed to be a patient for a medical student on his psychiatric round so of course the performance anxiety is beginning to rear its head i really need the cash stipend though get checked out asap i

a cup an hour ago or so and since then im so excited having all these amazing plans like i could do anything but then the anxiety kicks in that i cantand then i jump back again and jumping from thought to thought i cant stick with anything to do because im in my next plan already and its like a crazy train non stopim alone in my flat and taking to myself out loud and im exhausted but its fun in the same time uhmm i hate it i get so anxious at the weirdest times and about the weirdest things like signing my name and filling out forms in front of people carrying a full cup of hot coffee they all make me jittery or even shakey its annoying getting anxious at all i have to do to get ready for florida it doesnt help that im only sleeping 3 hours a night having issues pertaining to family members really making me anxious and sad guess ill have a good cry and start getting ready for florida hope everyone is having an ok day i should go somewhere but cant because of this huge fear i feel is coffee that bad for me finished my other class assignment took a shower and picked up a few things from the supermarket they moved all the stuff around so its more nervewracking to find things still had anxiety but kept it down by doing stuff now sitting down again and waiting to feed the cats and make dinner i think the kids will be home so itll be family night im not doing well today ive already texted the crisis line and made a safety plan seeing pdoc tomorrow just feeling really low and hopeless i was on edge yesterday on account of the very poor behaviour of others my anxiety was quite heightened as i was in constant worry about what these people might do next it was all very mortifying and i was so very grateful when the event came to an end oh god my anxiety is spiking and i dont know whats going on i feel horrible and i have no prns right now im so afraid that it was obvious at work that i was almost having a panic attack but i just didnt have any way to deal with it im still feeling so on edge i need to get going home so i can stop at the pharmacy and refill my prns big hugs to all those having issues if you ever need to talk let me know please be safe im still shaky after my crisis of yesterdayi have so much to do to get ready for florida i have to get on my feet quickly usually my daughter grounds me but shes at her dads not sure how to move forward quickly jennifer 1967 anxious because i need to be cleaning and packing instead of watching politics a punishment of my own making i hope everyone is having a good day slow day anxiety about 1030am and not abating much wrote a poem outside of class and did a load of laundry tried some retail therapy and it helped a bit now making dinnerhave to get every ten minutes to baste the chicken its good but a pain in the neck to make i had some of those there was one where i even convinced the er doc that i was indeed having one but id rather go and be wrong than stay home and be right i can relate to this i get bad chest pain with anxiety ive never gone in though but my doc did 2 ekgs to make sure things were good amandabroken i got the horrible news that im supposed to be here the rest of my life i guess my anxiety is way up but i feel very numb jennifer 1967 angelique67 jennifer 1967 ok now that ive totally wasted the weeki have about 5 days of activities to cram into one and still hope to leave at 300 am saturday morning at least im moving in the right direction my anxiety is increasing as time passes wth the world is not ending i need to go down to the pool my sanctuary and float for awhile i hope everyone is doing well angelique67 did two loads of laundry and planned meals for the week otherwise just reading and posting making dinner tonight anxiety rolled around 1030 am laid down for a while but couldnt sleep i may have to take some more artane in the morning will discuss with new pdoc i am doing well nobody in my family other than my grandma got me so much as a card for my birthday not that i need presents but some kind of acknowledgement or something would be nice especially when my sisters get so much i feel like im being a brat but it really hurt my feelings i keep fighting off tears oki really dread my anxiety disorder nobody needs to feel sorry for meit just helps me to get it off my chest i get this paralyzing anxiety before every vacation and every holidayreally before any big change i hate this with a passion i work on it in therapy i use my coping techniques and yet it remains i am so paralyzed i cant get off the recliner and im leaving tomorrow and i have to get my drivers license renewed it might as well be traveling to the moon for as capable as i feel anyway thanks for letting me get some of it out its an added pressure on my daughter and thats not fair to her i wish i felt nothing sometimes being too sensitive and emotional is the pits i need to calm down take a deep breath do my daily calm meditation make a reasonable plan and be gentle and compassionate with myself beating myself up for this wont help anything just remain calmtake deep breaths did three loads of laundry and vacuumed the living room had to stop because my sides hurt i dont know what the deal is worked on my poem for the church magazine will probably send it in tomorrow still having anxiety even with the lower dose of latuda ugh im struggling to fall back asleep because im so anxious already took a prn hopefully it helps soon things have been going ok but its just such a slow process im so scared it wont be fast enough for us to make it through everything i need help but i dont know what will help or what i need right now im just afraid jennifer 1967 i am on a roll a good roll but inside my head it is saying you are a failure you will mess up you will fail i know this is not true but i know everyone here shares the same struggles so i am distracting myself here at the coffee shop and talking to anyone here who will listen psychnitrous i been doing fairly good being calmer with anxiety since therapy but i had a slip up yesterday and i even told my therapist via email while he was nice and encouraging about it i still feel like i probably annoyed him just so frustrated with my setback jennifer 1967 jennifer 1967 jennifer 1967 amandabroken same experience it happened more than a year ago i swore theres a brown spot at my chest where my heart is suppose to be after my panic attack maybe its there before and didnt notice thank you hope all of you who are hurting start feeling better soon take gentle care of yourselves woke up late again neither my husband or i slept well sent in my poem to the person in charge of the church magazine hope it flies been a quiet day anxiety came up around 1pm so i laid down for a while husband came in around 2 pm and is still asleep i need to get up and make dinner soon another early morning went to church then picked up groceries for the week for some reason we picked up a bunch of chocolate i didnt have lunch or my afternoon meds so that may be it starting dinner soon anxiety hit around noon but was busy so it didnt bother me as much im not really nervous today the people in my head are talking to me and keeping me upbeat t says i shouldnt focus on the people but since they are helping my anxiety i think i will i lost my anniversary ring sometime this morning it was loose already and it fell off husband decided to buy a new band it was some serious bucks and i dont know if we have enough to last the month im frustrated sad and anxious i couldve waited until next month to get a new one but he was persistent im not as upset as i could be though so the meds must be doing something went to t and cut it short because it was there when i noticed my ring was missing spent most of the day backtracking to places and asking people i think someone took off with it after it fell making dinner now its going to be a tight month slightly anxious about my therapy appointment tomorrow my t is great and i love going but a little part of me gets a little anxious before each one having intense feelings of anxiety today have taken my medication and tried my daily calm meditation several times so far its not working hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling doing so well with my anxiety that im not taking xanax klonopin or something otc i take for anxiety so far  no withdrawals before the trip quite a few panic attacks and severe anxiety and now nothing reading a good but simple book 15 things you should give up to be happy helpful to me hope everyone is ok and has a good day there is now a new person in the room that the bathroom connects to mine and we are in there at the wrong times for each other its inconvenient and anxiety provoking at least i got two homework assignments done the third is rather long so ill work on it tomorrow anxiety hit around 11 am so laid down and didnt get up until 230 pm i missed prepping the chicken for dinner will have to think of something else to eat since all four of us are home husband is taking a nap now so it may be a while i had other stuff to do today but i slept through it hopefully ill feel better tomorrow my therapy session this afternoon was great however my dog broke his hind leg so i am really anxious and stressed i did tell my therapist via email and he never replies unless its during office hours but he did at 830pm telling me he was so sorry and we are in this thoughts and i can come in on friday what a night jennifer 1967 gad bipolar borderline personality disorder my best trait is reasonable much understanding has come with age and experience however tonight i can barely control my unreasonable panic today i safely and carefully posted items for sale on an internet site in my area if anyone wanted to buy either item they would have to contact me privately to gain correct name or location so that isnt a factor in my severe anxiety what i am feeling is exposed i could almost vomit the terror is so palpable i have no respect for myself because this is unreasonable faces and thoughts of strangers pass through my head so strongly i can almost see them the psychic feeling of others is pushing me over and trampling me with the quantity i tell myself it isnt reasonable and it isnt real but there seems severe danger i know from being taught that it isnt real but logic and frightflight of the terrorized animal is at war within me i am cold and sweating i am sick from tension it will go away im sorry youre having a tough time are you feeling any better this morning im having a hard time watching my little birds 18 year old daughter and niece fly feeling tremendous pain and pride right now hope everyone is ok and having a good day finished last homework assignment did a load of laundry picked up test strips and lipitor made the brine for the roasted chicken while my husband was napping took a shower at least i did some things today cookies will have to wait until tomorrow i had some anxiety around noon i was out so i had to hide it a bit soundoff umpulsive nike007 buffy01 kaboodle   hello leod i hope you are feeling

hope you feel better soon sending big hugs cepheidvariable  i had a bit of an attack on the bus last night it was most unpleasant the tight chest the difficulty breathing the shaking beyond control and the panic all was going to be a disaster add to that the humiliation that this was all quite public also public was the aftermath for it was a good hour of coming down before i returned back to normal for an hour i continued to shake breathe with difficulty and experience a racing heart i was supposed to fill out and sign myself in to a meeting and couldnt even hold the pen it was embarrassing asking someone else to do so for me during the meeting support group i was sick with worry about getting home and thus walked for 45min instead of taking the bus at my favorite coffee shop having breakfast and just kicking back feeling better this morning sun is shining again watching the comey hearings and about to head to the beach hope everyone is ok and having a good day one tiny bit of my anxiety is gone today i got an email this morning that my deferment on my student loan was approved that saves me almost 150 a month i am already anxious about the day though my boyfriend just left for the day so ill be home alone for most of it plus the job recruiter ive been working with is going to call the ceo of a company i want to work for about me i keep telling myself that if he feels comfortable enough calling the company about me i must have a shot at the job im just so worried about it and on top of all that i have an interview elsewhere this afternoon that i dont feel prepared for so much to do and so little time to do it my anxiety has been extremely high lately ive been searching for a full time job for months and have posted extensively on that in other areas so ill skip the details for now last friday i was contacted about a job that i had figured i was passed over for and they let me know that theres another opening and they are seriously considering me i feel like i practically have the job they wanted to start a background check and contact my references nothing there that will change their minds so now im just waiting for an offer and its killing me its now wednesday so the background check should be done i assume theyve made contact with most if not all of my references and still i havent heard anything im not overly excited about the job itself but i really need something full time and its so exciting to possibly finally get a break i just wish they would call or email me and let me know whats going on the other part thats making my anxiety so bad is trying to figure out the timing of everything my current job has no delay in payment so once i quit i wont have a last paycheck a few weeks later to rely on for bills i could potentially go a full month with no income before i get paid at the new job and thats tearing me apart i really cant figure out any way to time it so that i wont have so much time without income and i dont know what i can do to make it through that time im hoping that worst case i can borrow money from my parents theyve been helping me pay my rent for the past few months so maybe this could be a last time rent payment that i can use for other bills since the next month they wont be giving me money for rent i dont know yet im not getting any information and its driving me crazy i hope you get a call soon it was a bad day today lost a little girl there was nothing we could do my anxiety right now has risen sky high after a confrontation for some reason i am feeling at fault as though i erred or was inhospitable  this despite saying and addressing what needed to be done so i worry about repercussions even though i know i was absolutely right my anxiety is fairly low today and i am thankful for that i am concerned it will be soaring next week it will be busy at worktraveling and working late a few nights i had an anxiety attack yesturday one in over 30 years i hope they dont come back i thought i was rid o them could have been because i missed a med im on 10 of them a day dowdythefifth the amount of anxiety i have about washing my hair and going to the dentist is insane how did i get like this i wish i could go home to my favorite place and time jennifer 1967 today after a not bad day yesterday woke up and was anxious straight away was better later on in the day there is no rhyme or reason to anxietysigh im wondering how i managed to sleep for 12 hours ive had two cups of coffee with freeze dried coffee mixed into it for strength but i still feel spaced out and incapable of anything i wish i were at home with no dentist appointment to get ready for and just be able to sleep 24 hours a day if i want angelique67 jennifer 1967 angelique67 anxiety is getting to me emotionally i am struggling this morning due to a family crisis i also have a deadline at work i am worried about my ability to handle this week i have learned to handle the routine but crisis is still a huge challenge for me to handle maybe i can respond better than in the past struggling todaythoughts are swirling in my head i dont knowwish i could press the pause button sorry i checkedin twice jennifer 1967 i have to manage to appear like i have it altogether for the next 3 days at work we have a deadline and are working into the evening hours but i am strugglinganxiety headaches tired worried sad what a mess jennifer 1967 my stomach and nerves tell me im anxious about something wish it would be more specific spoken like a survivor im not equipped for this cold weather i may just stay in at 7 i really wish i had ice and some rum and a little striped straw and coke of course and if i did id go hang out in the solarium and watch tv ive been craving a rum and coke lately i guess something is reminding me of when i was 20 or so quite anxious today have tried to use deep breathing to help and made myself go for a 20min walk up the beach i think i found a big source of my anxiety theres a new guy in my department 3 people total at work and im still training him currently work is really really slow i want to send him to a different department so we can all have something to do and not just stand around twiddling our thumbs but theres not a lot of work in the other departments either for some reason this gives me anxiety like i want the guy to like me or not see me as a jerk or something but i dont really care if he likes me the last couple of days hes been in the other department  theyve been good days for me but hes not the smartest cookie  keeps coming back to our department when i told him multiple times that i would call him back when we need his help i just want him to go away having anxiety and panic attacks today out of nowhere i wish i could get better control of these things i always wonder what im doing wrong when they hit i hope everyone has a nice weekend and am sending hugs to those that are struggling have to read for church on sunday im not doing well physically so i hope i still can do it anxiety is building up jennifer 1967 i started wellbutrin on wednesday and was not prepared for the ramp up of anxiety had a hellish day yesterday today i have cut out all caffeine even decaf coffees i seem better today i have heard that the initial anxious phase is tough then there is the honeymoon phase i hope i get there im struggling with anxiety and i have a newborn to look after the birth was traumatic and he ended up in hospital for jaundice for 3 days im coping with infected stiches and taken tons of antibiotics i just want to keep my head above water so i can look after my son jennifer 1967 im sending best wishes and positive vibes to everyone that experiences panic and anxiety during the holidays you dont have to read this im just posting this so i can process it and hopefully keep moving i get anxiety on the holidays that usually progresses to panic attacks pretty rapidly right now my heart is pounding and i have a big ball of dread in my stomach theres a lot i need to be doing right now but im paralyzed im using my anxiety coping techniques i dont understand why it happens i wish i did i love my familythere is no serial killer to fear im sure there is rhyme and reason to it but i havent nailed it down yet im trying hard not to beat myself up too badly for my failings sending hugs to all those who are struggling yzen depression has pretty much been lifted but still feeling very anxious and worrisome any time i am outside i always fear that something bad will happen so i am constantly looking around at my surroundings i couldnt get my panic attacks under control and wasnt able to go to the thanksgiving meal i have one family member who had a fit over that i thought the response could have been more forgiving my daughter said mom thats like going into a flower shop expecting to order bagels you cant expect something that she doesnt have in her aaaahhhhwise young lady seeing perinatal psychiatrist today hoping he adjusts my meds i need to stop feeling like this want to be able to eat properly and enjoy my baby at least some of the time i have someone in my life that has an anger management problem they can be and frequently are vicious hostile and aggressive they do usually refrain from throwing things but they have been known to follow people home who cut them off in traffic and harass them lots of yelling with this person everyone else takes it in stride now im no shrinking violet i can shut people down with the best of them and im fairly good at hand to hand combat thank you taekwondo there is no danger to me other then the fact that i am sensitive and peaceful and find it beyond acceptable or pleasant i also dont want my child around it either i have to go to a funeral with this person tomorrow and spend time with them afterwards my anxiety has ratcheted way up and ive had one panic attack already for which i broke out the valium i will talk to my therapist about this when i see her after christmas i wanted to see if anyone had any advice or insight on how i can just chill out i feel utterly ridiculous everyone else is ok the problem is me whats up with the panic attacks my dad was exactly this way triggering me maybe thanks much for any input falldusktrain sooo today started good but that happy episode was interrupted by an earthquake strength anxiety attack i hadnt had such a big and strong anxiety attack since january 2016 i took my mom to the apple store and boom inside the apple store people suck up my energy i did a grueling workout this morning and i was no where as tired as i was when i was at the apple store major depression i can handle most of the time but when it is combined with anxiety it is literally hell on earth for me feeling anxious full of dread and pressured today its okit just helps me to type it out here as far as i can pinpoint ive either had too much caffeine this morning havent taken a valium in several days and its out of my system or making a to do list for the month of december with 106 items on it was a bit much im guessing its a combination of all 3 one of these days ill learn to let go of the internal pressure what a glorious day that will be sending hugs to all those that are struggling i have someone in my life too who needs anger management skills the effect on me is terrible and i experience hurt and rage the only thing i know to do is to keep a safe distance and control how much time i give to the person what is maddening is that this person would never in a million years treat a friend the way i am treated so the only advice i can offer is to remove yourself somehow from that persons life they have not even tried to put the work in to stop terrorizing you dont let them get away with it stand up for yourself and limit limit limit the time and attention given to them good luck im sorry about the funeral jennifer 1967 jennifer 1967 my day was good i got up at a decent time and ran errands i noticed traffic being a little heavy with shoppers im having a little anxiety right now was doing good when the sun was out i was productive todayfinished some cleaning pdoc raised my sertraline to 100mg and olanzepine to 5mg daily hope this helps me the olanzepine does calm me a little anxiety and ocd playing up today with thoughts of my babys difficult birth jennifer 1967 hugs to those that need them took husband and daughter to urgent care so they could get meds for their sinus infections hopefully theyll feel better soon im in quite a bit of pain from all the work the last two days tomorrow is t and pain doc so hope ill be good for that during this time of year i use to plow through all the holiday decorating but having to take it slow this yearwell im restless physical pain and family illnesses make this hard but i want to have everyone on board because i cant do it all myself lots of pacing and doing little things until i cant bear it this is usually a rough time of year for me but i have to consider others as well anxiety still very bad for me im beginning to feel disconnected from my body more often than not i still worry about everything and my ocd still bothers me hoping that my seroquel starts to help my anxiety thought it seems like it has messed with my appetite lowered hanging in there at hospital today getting stiches checked after birth dont need to take anymore antibiotics which is good and dr said she can see its healing so that has made me feel better otherwise i am still having ocd thoughts and anxieties but trying to deal with them one step at a time keep feeling guilty as i think the depression and anxiety is affecting my ability to bond with baby i love him so much but he also triggers me as i still feel not up to the job of being a mother i was more anxious than usual today but im not sure why nerves definitely i know its work related the thought of going in tomorrow is making me feel nauseous jennifer 1967 jennifer 1967 jennifer 1967 88butterfly88 got through the dentist and physical therapy appointments my dental tech mentioned that six months ago i was limping slightly and now im not i guess thats good still anxious but that will be over soon i hope hugs to those that need them cant keep attention focused on anything for more than a minute grinding my teeth and tensing up just by looking at shopping sites online worse is that im blaming myself for being like this anxiety is a pretty new thing for me 4 years or so compared to the other diagnosis i have i feel like i dont have a clue in how to deal with itlive with it im feeling nervous my stomach is in a knot over getting blood work ive have had blood work a ton of times i dont get why i am so nervous its also not helping that im hungry but cant eat until after the blood work and of course with my rotten luck i woke up very early fharraige fharraige i finished my college semester and yesterday went to my doctor for my yearly routine a bit upset because the process of getting my fluoxetine in tablets instead of capsules it takes a bit longer and i have to call to make sure its in tablets again i hope you stay feeling better still in pain even after pt yesterday i now have pain on the left hip therapist may try dry needling to see if the right side loosens up still have home exercises to do anxious about health issues still will talk to t on monday im just trying to take it easy which is difficult for me to do since its the holiday season  with christmas 12 days away im pretending to be on a mini vacation trying not to think too much im on a monthly disability but i have goals first to volunteer then work part time  go to school its real hard not to have that anxiety it literally keeps me up i dont sleep well or when i do sleep its at odd times when others are sleeping im up when people are up im asleep like right now its pushing on 3am  im still up but thats because i slept for 3 hrs then 4 hrs later that evening anyone who says that living all on your own is easy is lying especially wo friends family support but all on your own were you have to make constant decisions  figuring every single step of the way out im telling you its very easy to slip up i dont recommend living like this to anyone because if your not mentally strong or have a tolerance for extreme boredom of sitting around your apartment for long stretches like in the evening when it really isnt safe to go out until the daylight you could very easily lose your mind get into trouble ie go to jail get hooked on drugs become homeless or even death i know what im talking about life is tough ive seen the documentary the bridge well time to fix some eggs feel free to drop a positive line if not thats okay too loving these short days 8 days until a christmas nightmare having ongoing anxiety attacks since very early this morning its so bad i couldnt even take the trash out to the street get to my doctors appointment and am barely typing this out cant pinpoint it today it started shortly after i got up why must this scourge afflict me so any of us its just evil sending hugs to everyone that is struggling anonymous50013 talked to t on monday dont feel much better but need to focus on the present instead of the future i had went to an old web site and ended up getting malware on my laptop so have been spending a couple of days clearing it and doing various security stuff im not going to put as much stuff on it now while i want to look forward to christmas im not looking forward to all the cooking it ramps up my anxiety even though i know im a good cook and my husband will help woke up okay today but palms are sweaty asf for no reason i have class today so i wasnt ready but after eating breakfast and getting ready im feeling a bit better im in a mother and a baby unit for postnatal depression and anxiety my anxiety is so high as my husband and his family become emotionally abusive when i get ill he wont visit his son she shouted at me on the phone and called me selfish ive reported the past and present incidents to my primary nurse and she has put safeguarding on my file i might have to speak to social worker im scared to go home as i dont know what he or his family will say to me hell make me apologise like last time so he doesnt chuck me out and take my baby i think i need to go into a refuge ill be a single parent im so scared and confused i still love him but i cant live with him x at 4 15 this morning i had a really massive pannic attack the worst ive had in quite some time its thrown all my other mi psymptoms in to chaos and i am really struggling today just wondering i have not been prescribed them just for anxiety but have in the past for anxiety and depression together how far should you take it i already feel completely wrecked and im so anxious because of it i want to run away right now im wondering if i should call in sick tomorrow morning what specifically is causing your anxiety do you know sorry to hear it yes maybe take a sick day to recover and think about things is there a pleasant person you can approach for help and extra training big hugs this is going to sound strange but i need some support i was exposed to lice by my friends daughter she found it early and told me i havent had any signs of it and i told my girlfriend right away her reaction was no big deal i am scared that ive given it to her and because her attitude is so lax she will get infested all my signs and symtomdvofvdepression are here everything i read on the internet contradicts itself i wont let anyone touch me i am like a leper in public i refuse to sleep in the bed with her what can i do this is so stressful even with an amazing realtor to help me i feel so overwhelmed i think i should crawl back under my rock where i belong i dont deserve happiness my sister is pushing me to stay with it at least this is definitely my fault can anyone pm right now im having this crippling night time anxiety attack i havent had a night time anxiety attack this bad in a very long time seesaw isnt that the worst when you know they are well meaning but they totally miss the mark sorry you are spiraling hey seesaw how are you doing now okay things are better this year so far i have to pay attention to that i can feel the anxieties wanting to bubble to the surface so maybe acknowledging them instead of trying to ignore them will help me stay on track first weirdly theres a part of me thats uncomfortable with how much better ive been doing i mean im not great but im not terrible either and thats a big deal ive spent so much of my adult life worrying that when im actually able to take a break from it i get scared that im digging myself into an anxietydebt and it will all come forth in a huge meltdown at some point second im going to my moms house in a few weeks for the holidays her and i usually get along but her anxiety and depression rub off on me pretty severely ive had some of my most drastic and dangerous thoughts about myself while trying to console her and she has a way of choosing words that are subtly hurtful and bore under my skin for weeks though she doesnt mean them also even if shes perfectly fine during my visit ive had a few nasty meltdowns while staying at her place just from being away from my own private space and life i love her but its not a happy place to me third im still very scared about getting through the first three months of the new year these have always been the darkest and scariest months for me when my ocd thoughts can get extremely creative and outlandish and drag me down to the lowest depths of anxiety and hopelessness i do feel hopeful that im doing better right now than i have done in previous years at this time but im still extremely nervous about the next few months i know i can handle all this im doing okay i have a few bad days here and there but thats universal and nothing exclusive to my situation its normal i will keep managing and keep working things out you sound pretty positive about yourself i mean you know your limits and can contain yourself around your mother as for your anxiety i can relate if things are going good i get scared too from catostrophic thinking and just wait for something bad to happen i just have to think everything will be ok good luck anonymous50013 bjornen huge hugs to you would like to recommend a book when things fall apart by pema chodron dont feel like you have to read it but during my own hard times its really helped that being said you are not going through a hard time so maybe its just something you can come back to i think its a normal thing to be afraid that things are going to go back to  when you are happy or to be afraid that it wont last at the same time it is not a comfortable feeling fear and dread one thing that brings me solace is that emotions are not stagnant happy ones or sad and anxious ones i really like what avlady said too i think youre gonna be ok youre a bright spot and with your mom you can set a boundary if you need even if you dont say it directly to her and you know your limits anonymous50013 whoa ok bjornen i have this quite often these days i cant sit or lie down ill just keep walking in circles listening to music on my phone but i keep changing songs cause nothing seems fast or heavy enough videogames are too stressful i try to smoke a cigarette but it does nothing it lasts for an hour or so weird panicky feeling thoughts racing through my mind its just chaos you can handle it you sound very insightful and capable of dealing with whatever life throws at you thats good newsa positive trend ill be thinking of you and sending you positive vibes while you are at your moms house and hoping everything goes better than expected i agreeyou sound very insightful sending big hugs i have no advice but just wanted to thank you because youve also managed to describe my experiencethough in my case i try to ease it with food i can lose half a day or so to it hardly have the patience to eat but maybe i should keep candy with me or something to see if it works it sounds like your anxiety attacks make you become impatient it does that to me too however here lately my attacks have gotten much worse in my experiences when i have an attack it feels like im going absolutely fast while everything around me is moving slow or not moving at all i hate how anxiety gives me way too much energy and adrenaline so much so that it makes me sick introspectiveme sometimes it helps me to focus on square breathing actually count it out while you do it anxiety usually makes us take short rapid breaths so doing this exercise helps to slow you down panic is the worst feeling in the world inhale for 4 seconds hold for 4 seconds exhale for 6 seconds and hold for 2 seconds then repeat introspectiveme adaremoon i have been feeling like this since i finished my college semester last week i also havent been doing a lot of mindfulness or meditation lately meds or withdrawal from them can make me restless like that someone meaning well gave me some information that has now sent me on a complete out of control spiral seriously why cant people mind their own business seesaw hello finding me well where i live there are hair care salons that

im feeling awful right now i have to go in to my new job that is very stressful plus i have to work with a new colleague i havent met before im so bad at dealing with these unknowables ugh i just want to disappear i would be so grateful if someone would write me some encourageable words new working environments are always difficult try to make a new friend i hope the day has gone well for you anxiety makes everything so much harder you got this i cried my eyes out at my therapist before going in to work today one thing i know im not staying at that place thats for sure just awful to work there thesadgirl matbell thesadgirl sunnydisposition can you take benzos for the transition to new work place just until you get settled up to help with the anxiety matbell i sympathise mat sending you very best wishes my depression this year was sparked by work stress the benzos family of drugs didnt help it was just like taking a sleeping pill if you can leave the job you hate thats great you are misinformed dear friend benzos are not the monsters youre making them out to be they are addictive in long term but so is coffee sugar wine whiskey sex and so many other things in life all meds especially psych meds are scary i get scared as well but we cant let fear decide whats good for us and whats bad benzos serve an indispensable purpose in the treatment of anxiety they are super quick to action other than addiction they dont have any other scary side effect to worry about like increased appetite messed up sex life tardive dysknesia movement disorders ectthey act quickly and bring down anxiety a job none other med can do anxiety is a war and you cant leave an important weapon such as benzos and go unprepared to fight the war moderation is the key atleast reap the short term benefits use them for a month until you get settled into your new job and then if you still want to quit you can stop without getting addicted to them no one gets addicted in 1 month so you are safe there most people end up taking them as per need basis like in situations where they absolutely have to get that extra help to manage anxiety you have to weigh the benefits which are huge if it can help with managing anxiety help you work help you get social i mean thats the kind of benefits that make them worth itagainst the negatives  which besides addiction and dependence i dont know if there are others generally speaking they are a necessary evil just like other psych meds rest its your personal decision at the end you dont have to take it if you you dont want but if you are avoiding it solely based upon addiction and dependence issues you should stop coffee sugar wine and any other thing that causes addiction if benzos can give you your life back or help you to survive anxiety in other wordsisnt it worth considering to take them just a thought used wisely and in minimum dosage that helps taking them in situations where you absolutely have to working with your doctor can help you avoid any big problems that may arise with its use this is my personal opinion im no expert you should ask your doctor and maybe talk to people out here and see if its worth it or not all the best ps you can try propranalol beta blockers as well they are also fast acting and help with anxiety without the fear of addiction and dependence why do my legs always feel like theyre going to give out on me and why can i feel air going through them once i feel this sensation the panic sets in and the attack begins hello warrior i dont know as i really have an answer to your question assuming theres

the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting anxiety symptoms often come with something else or it can be just anxiety disorder itself perhaps you may need to ask your doctor so you can get the support that you need im sorry you had this experience perfectly understandable nothing to be embarrassed about it best wishes hi alli havent been on here for a while but have some info i wanted to pass along first of all i do have an anxiety disorder gad but this is what happened to me on top of that the daily anxiety that i was dealing with became worse for no reason i developed ocd and a high level of fearof everything i was afraid to wash dishes afraid to drive the car afraid to take a shower afraid to go to the market afraid of a lamp on a table or even going to bed it got to the point where i was terrified of everything imaginable at times i felt like i was losing my mind i had this boiling rage that i tried to keep under control i became supersensitive to anything anyone said often being reduced to tears i kept thinking i was going to end up institutionalized this went on for about 2 years and how i managed to keep a lid on it ill never know i began to have pain that felt like was behind my eyes i got suspicious and thought theres got to be something else going on here i started taking my temperature daily i always had a lowgrade fever having had lyme years ago i figured that it had resurfaced or i somehow got a new infection i contacted my lyme specialist and got tested for that and the other coinfections the only one that came back positive was a high level of bartonella henselae which is cat scratch fever my titer was off the scale the bacteria had gotten into my central nervous system and brain we do have a cat and my cat did bite me during play it was a deep bite on the back of my hand i do not recall due to the passage of time how long this happened before the anxiety got much worse but for anyone who has a cat or dog this is a real possibility typical symptoms are swollen lymph nodes etc but it can bypass all that like it did for me i told my primary about all this and he was very interested he said you know you would have never gotten diagnosed with this even if youd gone to an infectious disease specialist but having lyme years prior i did have some knowledge of vectorborne and zoonotic diseases thats how i got lucky and figured it out the irrational fear is gone as well as the fevers and ocd and now im back down to my normal and yes miserable level of anxiety sounds like health anxiety to me i know coz i recognize your fears coz i have them myself its a particularly unique kind of hell living with health anxiety cbt techniques are super helpful in dealing with this kind of anxiety much more than meds i am no expert and i just learned some techniques from a few books and online videos of cbt that ive read and watched basic techniques like challenging the thought its credibility and probability exposure therapy thought labeling and letting the thoughts exist and pass without getting into a fight with them and a bunch of other methods come in handy while dealing with this and has helped me keep my sanity intact can you learn cbt techniques form a therapist or from books and videos available online kaboodle sunnydisposition hello recently my anxiety gets worse if im listening to music or hearing certain noises nothing in particular that i can really think of it just randomly happens like if im watching a youtube video and a sound keeps being made i get super anxious or if the music is just an octave too high stuff along those lines does anyone else deal with this where their anxiety can be triggered by certain noises or music or sounds yes i experience some of that i have periods of time when if something is too loud or sudden i get very anxious also certain pitches of sound or certain repetitive noises now its even worse because last year something happened to my right ear its not quite right when it comes to certain sounds and i also have permanent tinnitus in it yesterday my son had youtube on too loud and it made me very anxious he watches some videos where the guys scream and shout a lot makes me very jumpy i am sensitive to motor sounds like leaf blowers lawn mowers vacuums and engines my anxiety is heightened a lot when i am around those noises those videos with shouting and screaming would bother me too sometimes i can be like this with noise depending on what level my anxiety is at thanks for the comments it can certainly be frustrating to be anxious when a certain noise hits your ears but you never know when a noise might irritate you hate fireworks night yes my moms yorkshire terrier some days i can handle it but most days i want to put a contract out on him his endless barking really ratchets up my negative energy including nervous energy i am very sensitive to noise and unnatural lighting both cause immediate nervous reaction i literally jump when i hear a sudden noise be it someones laughter a door closing that is why i have such a difficult time at work i have to deal with constant noise and very strong florescent lights i strongly dislike it to a point hate would be the appropriate word to use to describe how i feel dowdythefifth right now its a seemingly endless cycle with the noises giving me anxiety such as when i become anxious from certain noises or whenever i hallucinate screams or noises or mumbled conversations the hallucinations trigger my anxiety so it seems like anxiety is plaguing me all day long i am not afraid of dentists ok when i had to have my wisdom tooth removed i was a basket case but other than that cleanings fillings  checkups i am totally fine but today out of nowhere i have a full blown panic attack while im having a filling done i am so embarrassed  not sure why this happened to me  its bothering me so much i had panic attacks almost daily this summer because i came off celexa but as soon as i got back on it they stopped and now today my personality is strongly neurotic and im also just a plain curious person i also obviously because im here have anxiety issues the combination of the two can be rather unfortunate at times fortunately i can mostly sort my emotions fairly easily on this stuff and perceive when im anxiousfearful or just interested maybe a little obsessive  it depends on the situation so i guess my advice would be to check your gut and see how it feels hi pixie i have heard that novocaine has something in it that also raises our adrenaline level this is to speed up the numbing process by getting our blood moving faster or something like that my mother and i are both very sensitive to it and while we dont get full panic attacks we both deal with heightened anxiety during dentist visits even though we arent afraid of them either this could be a very likely reason you had a panic attack during the filling of course panic attacks are perfectly capable of coming out of nowhere too which is always fun pixie1 xanax is the only one that has worked for me and everyone in my family i was so bad at the dentists that i had to train her to revive me by putting cake frosting from a little tube under my tongue fortunately for me she specialized in traumatized children when i had my lower wisdom teeth out i turned so white and pale i scared the dentist lolol then one time i was getting a tooth capped and the novacaine wasnt working and it was getting later and later so i told the dentist to just go ahead and i never had any trouble after that theres just nothing as strange as life so sorry that happened to you the 2nd one i ever had was in my pulmonologists office he had no patience at all havent seen him in 5 years or so hey i just wanted to let you know that the adrenaline in the anasthetic affects me too it makes my heart race which is also what happens to me in a panic attack as a result i had panic attacks at the dentist too until i found out about the adrenaline since then  having explained it to my dentist they now make a point of administering it more slowly so that my body doesnt get such a rapid unexpected hit ive found that between that  me being prepared for it mentally while it still makes my heart race it doesnt descend into a panic attack i was listening to the deep focus playlist on spotify last night because i had to finish a paper i wound up having to skip every few songs or so on average because it just made me super anxious and irritated gotta love anxiety grath it seems like the music that ive been listening to from before my current depressive episode doesnt make me anxious at all but other random songs will or will not make me anxious currently just surviving through it until my anxiety gets put in check noises noises i cant stand noises most of the time it just really bothers my anxiety when i hear a noise that isnt a typical noise i am hoping that my newly prescribed seroquel starts to help my anxiety so i can live with some peace of mind lately every noise gives me anxiety kids running babies crying people arguing tv dramas that have people acting like morons the list goes on and on  it came back again bad for me everything annoyed me todayit seems like it might be impatience like a short fuse but ive had to move around a few times today to try and finish my 8page paper but i cannot escape the random noises bothering me meeting with the psychiatrist on thursday so hopefully i can get some new medication and get a handle on my anxiety finally i have the same problem worried about paper done zanax is what the doc gave me for now it helps greatly i am hoping that my psychiatrist prescribes me a benzo to help with my anxiety because its so rough for me i know people shouting in any form makes me anxious i just shut down motors from the landscapers equipment just irritates me to no end hi im sorry youre struggling so much with this i have similar experiences but it tends to be when my anxiety spikes  i become sensitive too noise or combinations of noise for example more than one person speaking or the tv on  someone speaking ive found that when it is unusually cold or if i have to be in sunit is a big trigger for my anxiety i usually try to work around it but it is making my life a whole lot harder with all the doc appts and other things need to be done during the day has anyone been anxious due to this and do you have any suggestions i have anxiety that acts up with cold dark temperatures sunny days are much easier on me but actually being in the sun for too long is also a trigger for my anxiety so i use those old school yellow bulbs in my rooms at home which helps a lot especially during cloudy non sunny days you know giving my mind an illusion of sun winters out here are short and mild comparatively speaking so i consider myself lucky that its over fast enough hello all hope youre well im really struggling with anxiety currently what ive discovered is i think that its the physical sensation of fear which compels me to engage in compulsions i took a small dose of clonazepam this morning about 30 mins later in noticed that i was calm mentally i was actually taken aback as it had been about 5 mins and i wasnt pacing around tending to my various concerns as i usually would be i thought about this trying to look beyond the well of course im calm im on a tranquilizer and what i came up with was this the reason i was relatively calm and not engaging in my ritualistic checking and mirror gazing etc was because the physical sensation of anxiety wasnt there cognitively the anxious thoughts and intrusive thoughts were still happening its just they had lost their meaning or moreover they werent causing me the physical sensation of anxiety the physical sensation of anxiety for me is sometimes indistinguishable from physical pain its so severe that id do anything to get rid of it however in its abscence i was able to mindfully label certain thoughts as anxiety or anxious thinking and redirect my attention onto something else normally i would struggle or cave in and engage in safety behaviours including avoidance but without the physical component the intrusive thoughts didnt have the same powerful influence they usually do so in my treatments i have learnt about distress tolerance since this discovery of mine this morning i can see just how important distress tolerance is its the ability to sit with that pain the physical terror and not run away from it or try and repair or tidy it away etc its incredibly difficult as your natural inclanation is to recoil from it and make it go away ive made serious efforts in the past to tolerate it and it does eventually pass and over time you learn to not give that physical sensation the credence you normally do however in the past i had a lot of support from mental health professionals and currently i dont have any im totally on my own against a myriad of anxiety disorders and now ive been told i may have personality disorders too how do you tolerate that anxiety when its so against your natural inclination i know compassion plays a key role as you have to care for yourself to want to put yourself through suffering in order to attain a positive outcome for yourself however i really struggle with being compassionate to myself i feel like the world is caving in on me when that physical anxiety hits for instance when challenging my ocd and touching things i really dont want to  its nightmarish yet i can sometimes bear it and not try and supress what im feeling just sit there with the anxiety and reengage in something else thus learning that the feeling doesnt mean anything is true or not true  its just a feeling i just am too fragile at the moment to sit with that fear i have too much selfhate to be compassionate to myself this is more to do with my potential personality disorders from what ive been told as a result of being unable to face my fears i am slipping backwards at an alarming rate ive become housebound due to my bdd im engaging in compulsions more than i am doing anything else i dont know how to get myself back on track i need some therapy but i cant afford privately and the nhs in the uk is not able to keep up with the demand for therapy  so i wont be getting any more therapy for a year at least according to my mental health team any tips for distress tolerance i know a bit about compassion and soothing the threat system with soothing rhythmic breathing etc but im too busy running away from my anxiety to even think about tackling my issues i know i cant get better without facing my issues but im really terrified the whole time and only have escapism or abiding the rulescompulsions to keep myself away from the hurt interested to hear your thoughts c5 thank you for your comments everyone just trying to figure things out my gut feeling is that its just me curious and interested another part of me does wonder though how it might relate to my anxiety i know i hate and im afraid of feeling out of control at any time anxiety is something i struggle with im an older person and it seems like the older i get the worse my anxiety gets i dont see a therapist nor am i on any kind of medication for anxiety or anything else for that matter things that help me to keep my anxiety level down include keeping myself occupied mostly doing household chores im retired  im also pretty reclusive so i have a lot of time on my hands i also do about an hourahalf of mindfulness yoga most days and i have a small dog i take for walks a couple of times a day regardless of the weather we live in a townhome  have no yard so daily walks are imperative i also spend quite a bit of time here on pc all of these things put together help me to keep my level of anxiety down to a dull roar as they used to say one other thing ill just mention is that personally i feel its important to maintain a peaceful calm environment i avoid watching any kind of violent tv or movies i dont watch the news on tv and when i listen to music its mostly of the quiet calming variety i have severe anxiety to the point that ive struggled to leave the house at times my therapist said a really good tool is to invite anxiety along with you to say i know your coming with me but you wont control me the more you give in to anxiety the worse it gets my therapy goal this week was to buy a journal my hands literally shook in the store but i did it dont let anxiety stop you also i take an ssri to help with anxiety and have clonazepam and ativan just in case i also use cbd oil i have a cannbis prescription and it helps a lot dowdythefifth i read a book called the happiness trap which dealt with a lot of the things you are describing it is about sitting with and feeling your different emotions instead of avoiding them that book changed my life all the best to you and your journey effexor xr has helped my anxiety a lot i havent had a tension headache in a long time from anxiety i dont worry as much as i used to i dont have as much social anxiety its more noticeable when interacting with strangers now i probably have to come off of it though due to side effects hypertension and high heart rate doesnt help with my panic attacks so i have ativan for those it tends to work as the episodes arent as long effexor xr hasnt done much for depression though dowdythefifth dowdythefifth hi i have had severe anxiety panic attacks and recently dxd wptsd i was taking 1 mg ativan twice daily for 7 years never upped the dose or needed to july of this year my panic attacks anxiety and depression yep that too started up again i did the best i could until october and went to a therapist i saw a psych np he changed the ativan 1 mg to valium 5 mg saying it was an equivalent dose the first week i about came out of my skin the anxiety was so bad the second week not so bad the third week it was if i wasnt taking anything at all the valium didnt seem to help but i wasnt having much anxiety i kept reading how the valium built up in my body over time and kept waiting for it to kick in it didnt i knew i was through with any withdrawal type thing from ativan i quit taking the valium last friday i believe it was in my system somewhat bc today havent had any panic just run of the mill normal anxiety that i have had almost every day since week 2 off the ativan i dont know what im asking just has anyone taken valium for 28 days and had withdrawalsshould i be having them i dont want to take it because of the long 12 life and thats exactly why the np put me on it ive also read that one hits a plateau pretty quickly and would need an increased dose i had an event w my 89 yo mil in july that set my panic off again majorly and feel i need to do something i dont want to get back on benzos of any kind buspar any reply would be helpful i also take venlafaxine xr 225 mgday and gabapentin 400 mg twice daily for diabetic neuropathy in my feet nothing else except diabetic medsmetformin id recommend xanax because it is the only one that has worked for me and my whole family but you said no benzos hope someone can help you i like my propanol it works on the actual physical symptoms you can take it daily or prn and its not a benzo i was feeling like the walls were closing in last night think its because of christmas fast approaching this time of year seems to cause my anxiety to spike  has in the past also triggered depressive episodes i have no explanation for why this may be the case today i feel kind of on edge or agitated not in an irritated with people way butfor example my jeans were creasing  touching my leg in a way that was irritating me  the arms of my tshirt were doing the same i had to go  change  im ok now but i can feel my breathing isnt right im too aware of it i think thats anxiety starting to creep in again i know where this is going  i feel powerless to stop it i know when they all come home there will be noise  theyre not doing anything wrong just family coming home from work  school but its like an assault on my senses  i just want to shut myself in my room  hide  cover my ears and they all think im being moody  then the arguments start and they say nasty words and im not crazy im not doing this on purpose i just get overwhelmed but they dont understand ive tried to explain it ive tried to explain the best i can what its like in my head but you need to be in it to understand i just need a bit of space  i dont mean to shut them out but isolating myself is the only way i know to stop the feelings drowning me my psychiatrist got my anti anxiety med scheduled for thr times a day and upped my anti depression medim really happy about it and she said that the meds that got upped will hlp me gt calmeri hope so i get very anxious unexpectedly from random noises i can never pin down what causes my anxiety to go up i also get frustrated very easily where i cannot handle certain things and sometimes everything makes me furious like when someone is texting me a lot right when i wake up i get annoyed and give short replies i do not know exactly why but it just happens with my anxiety i am on edge every day worrying that something will go wrong so i understand that im only a college student so i typically do not have to explain my annoyance when my anxiety is bothering me are you on any medication that might help i understand how you feel when i feel uncomfortable in my own clothes i know there is a problem personal space is a big factor in decreasing anxiety for some of us when were constantly surrounded by people sometimes we feel like were suffocating have you considered how much personal space you need and how much alone time you need for example i only want to be around people for less than 2 hours a day im not afraid of people and i very good socially if i need to be  but people annoy me after 2 hours especially since the holidays are here we can get sick of being in this merrygoround of annoying holidaythemed gatherings thank you both for taking the time to reply i wasnt in a good place when i posted  your replies really helped im not currently on any medication but i am getting to the point where i feel i need to go back to my gp  explain how heightened my anxiety seems to get at this time of year and yes  thats exactly the feeling  suffocated by people  thats exactly how it feels  i have to get out of the situation thank you again i am really not sure where to put this there doesnt seem to be a good place for it so i hope this is okay 20 months ago and for about 6 years before that i had to donate plasma to survive i could just barely get by but i also needed to juggle maxed out credit cards when bigger issues came up i was on a financial tight wire and frankly if my good luck hadnt happened 20 months ago i would be homeless and bankrupt by now so i feel bad asking this but it is bringing up new things that trigger my old crap and is hard to deal with i say good because it only came about because my mental health severely deteriorated i am now in a position that i can buy a very modest home in an area with a very reasonable real estate market this is freaking me out i feel unworthy which i am of course it is the smart thing to do since rents are increasing really fast so my fixed income actually shrinks every year colas simply dont keep up plus owning a home is a good investment and my mortgage payment will likely be less than my rent even though the house will be significantly nicer i even get my property taxes waived so i dont really have to worry about any significant increasing costs even electricity to dirtcheap here i am looking at building a house that comes with warranties and other assurances it is the wise move all around i am cycling through many emotions from fear to absolute terror to give a little idea about it i have never been excited about buying a car even though i knew it was going to be easy to pay off i dislike any kind of debt even the good debt of a home loan doesnt make sense since i will have more extra money with lower monthly payments i have been talking with an agent for two weeks over email and am meeting her tomorrow which is absolutely terrifying i am the type to use selfcheckout so i dont have to talk to anyone she seems quite nice and has closed a lot of va loans so is used to dealing with us whiny stubborn and issuefilled vets she is even kind enough to share 20 of her commission with me which is amazing to me the idea of meeting her is terrifying i understand completely it is a business thing but women usually look at me and run away talking to strangers is not exactly my forte especially women i have never gone through this process but am reading up as much as i can but it is still confusing it feels like i am entering a pitch black tunnel with lots of traps maybe it would be easier if i had a spouse to lean on i dont want to lay all my crazy on whoever reads this but i am even stressed and upset about the idea of having a neighbor or two that like to be overly social  defined as more than a hello once a month i live in a complex and have lived next to for at least 5 years and i dont even know their names and i doubt i have spoken a complete sentence to them ever i really like that so i have my usual selfloathing actually seething hatred and unbreakable belief that i deserve nothing good to deal with but there is even a little excitement fear social anxiety and whatever else involved with all which is new also i dont know if i have an exact question but if you can relate and give any advice it would be appreciated i know some may want to ask how someone like me could be well enough to sign mortgage papers i dont know how but i guess i am i read your post and i hear and support you this sounds like wonderful news im sorry your anxiety is doing a number on you you do deserve this i hope your meeting goes well just take one step at a time im here if you want to talk as you go through this good luck and best wishes thanks well i barely survived the meeting with the realtor so i guess that is good in the past 2 weeks i have spoken to more strangers than i have in the past year it is not easy i suffer from panic attacks on a daily basis im now at the point of vomiting through out the day i cant go on like this ive tried so many meds but nothing helps i feel like im going to die and no one can help me i take 10 mg of valium prn for anxiety sometimes i dont need it for days or a week it takes the edge off but doesnt fully get rid of the anxiety but then again when my anxiety is bad its really bad i got off all my meds 8 months ago micro dosed with shrooms at a ridiculously low level had never ever done any type of drug prior that trip and the next few days were the happiest ive felt in over 20 years now i use indica only weed i find that sativa strands tend to ramp up my paranoia scheeks im so sorry to hear what you are going through i deal with anxiety on a daily basis it tends to go up and down so i can relate try to answer this question what do you think you can do right now to feel better even just a little better try listening to music watching something entertaining on tv or watching a few videos on youtube that usually helps me feel better try taking a walk outside try talking to some friends do you have any friends that you can call text or talk to if so it may help to talk to them talking to a friend may help to distract you from what is bothering you having someone to talk to such as my friends or siblings helps me to feel slightly better even if my stress hasnt gone away maybe exercise try to figure out what is causing these panic attacks is it a worry are these just random panic attacks sometimes i like to remind myself that everything will be okay it doesnt help but i try to remind myself every single day im sorry if i couldnt help i wish you much luck in getting over your panic attacks im sorry my panic attacks have gotten much worse lately and i hate it too ive had to miss parts of classes due to it and tend to stop homework too do you know what triggers them maybe that could help you figure out what is making your body react like this and then work on it im sorry you are having such a tough time hope you feel better soon buffy01 buffy01 buffy01 im obviously not ready for any kind of work but i just cant afford to miss this opportunity so im jumping in with both feets im worried about the conflict of inner and outer world that goes on when we have to pretend to be social like nothings wrong so we can fit in with people and the work it takes to hide the secret that we just dont fit in not anymore not yet im worried about my inner world spilling into the outer world and leaving me exposed to the whole world to see how broken i am i just want to survive the first few weeks for the meds to kick in how do you manage to keep your inner worlds from spilling into the outside world help me out here i need it zyprexa helped with my anxiety and xanax cures the panic attacks fast techie180 hmmmm well this is a good question i should know the answer to this too since ive been hiding a major part of myself for the better part of 69 years somehow i dont know how i learned very early in life that there were things about myself that i must never talk about with anyone and so i didnt for most of my life i did try to loosen up a bit briefly a few years ago but it quickly became apparent no one wanted to hear about it so i stopped the one thing i know about hiding your inner world away from other people is that it can be exhausting especially if you keep it up for a long time as i have i think that perhaps having someone or at least someplace where you can be yourself might help thats something i dont have that i did have a few years ago  i know i really miss it now the other thing though is that having your inner world spill out may seem like a much bigger potential problem to you than would actually be in reality as long as it doesnt interfere with the quality of your work it may well end up not being of much consequence to anyone else also plenty of plain old exercise will help to dissipate the buildup of anxiety that can develop from feeling as though youre hiding something i do about an hourahalf of exercise most days plus i have a small dog i walk a couple of times a day personally i think its that buildup of anxiety that is likely to be at the root of having your inner world come spilling out if it does so the more you can do to keep your anxiety at bay the less likely it may be that youll expose yourself at least these are my thoughts with regard to your post sunnydisposition hello i have been suffering from very bad anxiety the last few months and no medication has helped me yet i currently take seroquel risperidone remeron and the seroquel has helped my psychotic depression out greatly even though it was prescribed for anxiety and my psychotic symptoms i should be coming off of risperidone and remeron in 11 days when i meet with my psychiatrist again i also assume she will be increasing my dosage of seroquel up from 100 mg to try and counteract my anxiety another thing i am assuming is that i will get a benzodiazepine for when my symptoms are really bad i have been on lexapro celexa prozac doxepin lamictal risperidone remeron seroquel clonodine busiprone during my two episodes of psychotic depression the anxiety aspect is new to me and i was diagnosed with gad and social anxiety so i was wondering what everyone who has had their anxiety fixed by medication which ones helped you i just want to bring it up to my psychiatrist to get her opinion on it i know snris are probably the next step for me since ssris do not work thank you busiprone celexa seroquel were all originally prescribed for anxiety although busiprone did not help me celexa made me worse just like the other ssris and so far seroquel has not helped my anxiety but it has helped my psychotic depression i take neurontin and vistaril for anxiety antipsychotics also worked except abilify and latuda my pnurses office doesnt prescribe benzos as they also treat substance abuse cases and dont keep it around dowdythefifth i have had success with both ativan and clonazepam but my doctors wont do benzos long term only to stabalize right now i use zoloft and marijuana i have a prescription for it cbd oil is actually pretty amazing at controlling anxiety for me scheeks the only medication that helps with my anxiety is ativan but i refuse to take it because it makes me gain weight oddly enough when i got on invega for schizoaffevtive disorder most of my panic attacks went away even though that wasnt why i was prescribed it i take klonopin as needed for any leftover panic attacks gabapentinthis has been great for me im lucky in that it gives me a little buzz ive read others responding that it doesnt work but it does for me it is also prescribed for nerve pain but it isnt addictive like vicodin although ive read it can be abused for the buzz just started opipramol for anxiety its a type of tca antidepressant but its mechanism of action is totally different its european so it might sound unfamiliar to you supposed to start working with in 2 weeks will post the results as time unfolds the last couple days i have been having this feeling of depersonalization it lasts for maybe ten minutes a time and i feel super strange during it it occurs 3 times per days since it started i was reading online about it and i do not think it has developed into full blown depersonalization disorder but it does bother me i feel like im disconnected from my brain and body i recently had my dosage of risperidone lowered and seroquel was added to my prescriptions about a week and a half ago so i was wondering if my heightened anxiety is a result of the seroquel kicking in or a combination of my risperidone being lowered as well as the seroquel my anxiety has been getting worse and my next psychiatrist appointment is in ten days has anyone else dealt with anything similar to this thanks i knew that my teeth in the upper back were a bit used since the paste is old and i havent have gone to the dentist in years i have noticed while eating certain things that were hard were a bit discomfort but no pain and just now i was eating pizza and one of my teeth came out all of the sudden i feel scared and sort of anxious because im 29 i dont know if thats normal when i was a teenager i would always have an attitude with my grandparents i was very rude to them and i really dont know why now i have a good relationship with my grandparents but i still feel extremely guilty for how i acted its been noted that ive matured and grown up a lot and im definitely not the person i used to be how do i get rid of this crippling guilt and allow myself to forgive im also concerned that my old friends who knew me during that time will think im a terrible person for how i used to act since they dont know who i am today i am leaning towards my current symptoms being a result of my risperidone being cut down by 50 instantly instead of being tapered by 10 every 24 weeks as recommended some of the withdrawal symptoms line up with what i am experiencing depersonalization anxiety appetite changes confusion if your grandparents forgive you for how you acted is that enough for you to put it past you if youve grown as a person i doubt they would have any harsh feelings towards you best of luck could you call your pdoc and run this by him well said dowdy i agree with dowdy you could also apologize to your grandparents to get closure and then put it behind you best wishes hey all so i notice something is wrong and i want to fix this no this isnt some amityville type of story but it does make me feel very bad about myself i think as a child i had a strong fear of death my parents were over protective and i would constantly fear anything that would harm me or the ones i loved because i feared this i would then constantly think about iti wasnt depressed but it did make me feel sad when i did think things like so for instance i would constantly think about my parents dying and how i wouldnt be able to cope with that happening as an adult i am getting other types of thoughts every now and then its hard to explain but i would think and say things i would never ever want to happen at all like if i thought about my parents i would randomly say i hope they die but that is exactly what i dont want to happen i dont know where that thought is coming from i will never wish or hope anything like that upon a loved one and at first i ignored it because its not something i ever said out loud so its all in my head i thought to myself well maybe its because thats exactly what i fear so much so my mind thinks about the opposite in a form of anxiety i dont know i didnt worry about it because of course i would never act upon that and i accepted that sometimes our minds say crazy things but that isnt who we are or what believe but then i said it once about my daughter and i felt terrible no i dont have thoughts of hurting my children or anything its not something i wish to happen i am afraid so afraid of it happening and even worse i dont want to attract anything negative i promise i am a kind hearted person i dont even have any bad habit or behaviors its not something that is driving me crazy its literally a random negative thought or saying in my head that sometimes i cannot control so i would then say as stupid as it sounds i hope  dies dyes their hair because god knows i dont even mean that maybe its just fear and anxiety but how can i forgive myself for even thinking something like that my question is how stop these negative thoughtssayings the same thing would happen to me with driving at first and sometimes even now i was afraid of driving and it sort of turned into a phobia and i feared it so i would constantly think of all the bad things that can happen but i never said i hope i die i would just think of me crashing etc which is understandable if its a phobia i just dont know where the i hope dies comes from anxiety i have a lot of these kinds of intrusive thoughts yes i presume they are the result of anxiety which i have a lot of i dont believe there is any way to stop them there is only acceptance of them compassionate abiding is how its referred to in the buddhist literature perhaps youre familiar with it if not heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice i suppose this could also be viewed as a form of pure o obsessive compulsive disorder family therapist kati morton uploaded a video onto her youtube channel on the topic of pure o heres a link to that video hope something in these resources will be of benefit hi guys i think ill create a separate thread instead of bumping my old one but you can find it here long story short basically i am an anxious person with current health anixiety that dramatically increased with the death of my mother i have gone through multiple fears of different diseases and at some point i started thinking what if what i have is a schiz and my hypochondriac fears are delusions ever since then i was super scared of schiz it took me a lot of googling to figure it out but i had a basic understanding of what i have and why my condition is at least questionable to call schiz ive read a lot of articles and posted on a lot of fourms until i found one where i consulted with a supposed certified specialist it was online so who knows how professional he is who told me that i definitely just have anixiety so whatever right i kinda calmed down later on few weeks ago i learned that my biological father with whom i dont live was diagnosed with f20 schiz he was diagnosed around the age of 43 plus minus so now i am super afraid of inheriting the disease and talking to that doctor guy ive figured that what ive had were definitely not delusions since in the condition the believes are so severe that people are given the medicine to get rid of them which i definitely dont need there are other ways to convince me i was wrong after i told that doc guy yeah thanks i feel better about delusions now he said that i am in the hypochondrical cycle and that i will soon find something else to worry about and there it goes literally the next day i first started thinking of unusual believes and then started suspecting i was hearing voices 4 days ago i was 100 sure that ive had no voices over the last 3 days ive had 2 incidences both of which could be explained by something else since i was not completely alone i work retail and the day before yesterday when closing and looking if everyone left in the supposedly empty of customers store for a second i thought ive heard voices somewhere far away like some sort of murmur and it felt like ah what was thatlike when you though you heard something for a sec but unsure what was that but i was super tired after an 8 hour shift and there was lots of noise in the building such as conditioner radio animals screaming i work at petco and it later turned out that there were janitors in the building who maybe were talking to each other and later on i tested and it turned out that i could recreate the exact same sound in my head and stop it whenever i want by another thought or by starting doing something else and thinking about it so maybe it even was myself thinking of what to look imagining it and getting scared of my own imagination for a second since i was super tired and not thinking straight the second case was yesterday and it would be also possible to explained by something else i was ringing the person up and ive heard someone say st right by my ear like not addressing me but like if someone said it to themselves the sound was coming from outside and was not inside of my head and it was coming from the direction of a person standing by me and there were 2 more people within my hand reach who couldve said it i did ask my coworker about it later on and looked very stupid btw but he said he heard nothing but also he maybe didnt even get what i was talking about or he maybe wasnt paying attention whatever so that could be explained by assuming that some of the people that stood close to me had said it and from what i understood its more common for schizophrenics to hear voices inside their head so what i wanted to know is if there is no clear evidence that there is a voice in my head and what i hear could be explained by something else i shouldnt yet be bothered by it right or at least not assume that what i have are the voices meaning if i was sitting alone and had a voice is one thing but another is when there is at least semireasonable explanation right how do people feel their voices also there is a thing of me now expecting a voice to pop up at some point and i am super afraid thanks ive been trying to look for a specialist but received no responses yet i agree with skeeyks you cannot stop the intrusive thoughts until your mood gets better i cannot stop thinking about death even though i know i wont act upon any of my thoughts i wind up thinking about my own death a lot but it does not make me feel down about myself because i know the thoughts are irrational best of luck to you i hope you are able to get your anxiety under control im in the same boat right now its very daunting and scary ive been getting intrusive thoughts and feel like im going to wake up one morning and just be psychotic same ill be sitting at work and will question everything like was that a real noise i heard out there or am i hearing things or ill fumble over the keyboard and be like why is this happening am i bout to schiz out i have trouble in the moment comprehending things because im not really paying attention but yea sounds like we are having a lot of the same stuff you on any meds rodzasky good luck finding a specialist to give you an evaluation i hope you get to the bottom of it best wishes dont hesitate to seek help from a dr as weird as you feel and think they will think im crazy in all reality we are very sane compared to most i work in le and trust me i see it all the time and i feel your struggle with the whole work thing i had an upper molar crumble out of my mouth around your age maybe a year or two older like you i had not been going to the dentistit was a bit of a wake up call even though it still took me another fifteen or so years to really start going regularly i dont remember how i felt about it at the timesurprised for sure i was eating a cookie when it happened for me i have psychotic depression so it is not psychosis or schizophrenia during my episodes i typically hear screams mumbled conversations tall figures some random words for me i would be bothered by any hallucination probably just because of my crippling anxiety i believe they were hallucinations 100 and i personally do not have any issue with having experienced them its just another part of life for me what has helped my psychotic symptoms the most was seroquel seroquel has completely rid me of my psychotic symptoms as well as my depression i do have side effects from seroquel but i guess it is worth it best of luck to you in getting the proper diagnosis i know that was very important for me to receive this sounds odd but im having anxiety about taking my xanax im afraid ill have all the side effects of hallucinate or something ive taken it in the past but my anxitey is worse than before and now everything kinda makes me on edge im not getting sleep and need to take it to relax and get sleep anyone else have this issue or any words of wisdoms thanks ok so ive had issues with anxitey and depression my whole life im 23 and recently switched to lexapro 20 mgs after being on prozac for a few years ive been having intrusive thoughts lately that are scaring me and making me feel like im crazy i know i wouldnt act on them but in the moment they pass thru my mind and my body tingles and i go into panic could this be from the meds im not suicidal but i have thoughts about it never could bring myself to doing it but it feels like nothing is helping i feel like im going to just snap and wake up a psycho one day does anyone else feel this ever or have experience with it im afraid to take xanax im prescribed because i see things about hallucination which is a big feari feel like im going to just randomly hallucinate as it is i know it sounds dumb but this is the place i feel comfortable asking for help or have recently read  any recommendation is most appreciated feel free to share letsbeatanxiety you should be alright if you take as prescribed ive never had a problem with my klonopin very similar to xanax its understandable to be worried about things like that it comes with the anxiety if you decide to take it just sit back and relax and try to listen to some music or read or something to take your mind off it till you fall asleep the easiest first ive known several people who have taken xanax specifically as well as others who have taken other benzos all of that was long term ive even taken a couple and none of us have had hallucinations should be pretty safe second sounds like bad anxiety but you probably have thought that too sounds reasonable that the lexapro is at least temporarily causing it though we cant be sure you could ask your doctor celexa made me horribly depressed and anxious and i had a really bad time on it where i refused to go to the doctor for a minor emergency because i didnt think i could emotionally handle it the switch could be doing it temporarily or it might be a short term side effect or lexapro might not work for you great thread im currently reading destressify i will look through my anxiety books on kindle and try to find ones that i think may be helpful nothing to worry about its just going to relax you and maybe make you sleepy not a single thing you said is dumb i have yet to introduce myself and am still new here im still very apprehensive of sharing bt i will say something i have learned and tell myself every time i have my moments death may seem like the ultimate fix or a quick solution to my short term issues however thats what any mental illness wants unnatural death is its victory so while i know i am weak against its punches sometimes i have far too much pride to let that pos beat me if you loose a battle learn from it write down the trigger write down your thoughts dont bs yourself be brutally honest and accept it as a starting point realizing you could be in a gutter rn i fear the same thing i truly do i sometimes feel psycho because in my moments im able to disconnect and not care about my destruction thank you for your share its comforting to know im not alone i hope you have a wonderful night and can relax sunnydisposition  jennifer 1967 im reading again a book about cbt its old school but cbt helps with my anxiety i just got through with a dbt workbook it helps as well jennifer 1967 my unexpected panic attacks stopped some time ago but about 3 weeks ago they came back and ive had 5 in these 3 weeks and its awful i feel really bad and so anxious during them i wish they would stop now im not afraid of them as i know they are random and i have accepted this fact but i really dont like them and want them to go away again i am sorry to hear you are suffering right now are any of your medications specifically for the panic attacks i guess the ativan could be if not have you considered going on medication to try and help it best of luck to you keep us updated guiness187055 im sorry to hear about your panic attacks i have struggled with anxiety but not as much now my anxiety is like a rollercoaster one moment ill feel okay then the next moment i feel anxious it sucks but i hope to one day overcome the anxiety that i feel one thing that i have done is accepting that my brain and mind are wired differently some people are wired differently not everyone is equipped to deal with anxiety effectively thats why some people need therapy and help others can have anxiety and they can do something and it just disappears i think talking to a counselor doctor or healthcare worker will help you the best they can try to figure out why you keep having panic attacks do your panic attacks come from any worries disturbing or intrusive thoughts try to figure out what is causing them i wish the best for you in life and i hope you find a way to overcome your panic attacks nike007 have a proper treatment by consulting a reputed and experienced doctor im sorry you are having panic attacks again i truly would rather deal with depression then anxiety i hope it clears up soon so last night after taking 400 mg of clozapine which should end all conscious thought in a half hour i was wired for 3 hours because i had to keep my heart beating if i stopped concentrating it would stop because i couldnt feel it i was feeling pretty manic all evening but the heart thing it has happened before i have a hard time going to sleep anyway without the meds id sit there for hours with rushing thoughts usualyl mistakes ive made regrets does anyone have ideas on how to sleep i stay on the meds i keep soothing music playing brain just rushes i take melatonin i am pretty obsessed with my heartbeat too if its beating too fast too slow i hate the way it makes me feel my cardiologist recommended i buy this gadget from alivecor it works with an app called kardia  gives you an instant ekg reading its amazing he told me its good for people like myself anxious anyways i do an ekg  if its normal i know theres nothing to worry about  that helps me relax  sleep i started out in science i have a bachelors degree in the field of geology which was active 10 years prior i decided to have a bit more fun in college and duel majored learning sculpture which i already know was stupid and worthless i then went on to graduate school in geologyabout the time that many of the science divisions in the united states shut down i ended up leaving after a personal conflict with my major advisor as she was very against religion and was notorious for creating conflict with students who suggested any religious ties period this was not something that i knew prior to going to school and while exiting the program the head of the department accidentally let it slip that this particular professor was known to have chased away postdoctorate students she was extremely difficult to deal with instead of going back to graduate school with two other offers from different universities that would have taken me in if i applied i decided to go for something different i pursued animation at a top private college and obtained my masters degree i faced a lot of discrimination there because it was filled with very rich students from very prestigious backgrounds i even put myself into the hospital trying to keep up with them by spending 3 to 4 days awake and sleeping an hour here and there to prove my worth i ended graduating with nearly all as it was a hard road because art is quite subjective and the stereotypical belief is that nothing is quite good enough many of the professors are equally hard on their own work and often judge students to years of people out in the profession well needless to say when i graduated i couldnt find a job anywhere i did here back from a few casino companies that were interested in my art they liked it until upper management and thats when i got turned down nothing in science absolutely zero i gave nearly ten years of my life trying to make a life for myself and now i am a parttime cashier at a local store in the middle of nowhere i have taken enough courses that i only need about 6 more before i can go back to school for premed and all the ones that ive taken thus far that count have been stellar grades but honestly im tired im so very tired all my younger siblings are married or in a relationship they all have decent paying jobs with and without education they take vacations and buy things they like im 28 and eating canned soup and 1 sandwiches from mcdonalds to stay alive i live with family because i cant afford anything much more on my own i have more degrees than anyone in my family has ever had and nothing works im good with books my employer told me personally that im a damn hard worker as did all my parttime employers in the past i can probably get handfuls of recommendations from them but i feel alone and worthless and worse i get treated like im worthless too customers often times come up and throw things on the counter and if i cant answer something they instigate a conversation about my lack of intelligence dont get me wrong there are so many nice people too but when the mean ones come they are downright ugly ive found myself going out of my way at the dollar store or grocery store for a cashier because i know what its like personally these arent stupid people they are just people so down on their luck that they dont know how to get out i understand 100 my family keeps telling me that im not trying hard enough that i somehow havent really pushed myself into finding a real job i havent made a decision without them as they control everything i even call them up when i want to spend my earned money to eat a subway or somewhere fancy like that i feel guilty about spending money needlessly on myself as i keep thinking that ill need it one day its developed anxiety in my life that i cant control everyone outside my family thinks that im a very happy because i dont take my problems to work or outside i wear the brightest smile i possible can hell i bet you at this point you can call me whatever you need to and i wont crack in front of you but it burns deep and i take my failures home with me every night it interrupts my sleep with nightmares and causes me to constantly worry about everything i do if nothing else ive become rather good at pretending that im not me any longer sometimes i look in the mirror and i cant really see me anymore i cant even do things that i enjoy anymore because i feel its all worthless i found that i like daydreaming more than anything else i like not thinking about my life or how im running out of money i like pretending that maybe in a parallel universe or what ever nonsense i have a normal life and a family about now hell i even pretend sometimes im pretty too it gets sadder and of course im consciences enough to understand that im really the me in any of my daydreams thats being either frivolous or downright illogical but i must be worth something somehow sorry for my bad english i dont know which forum to post this so i decided to do it here i am a 23 year old boy who have had suicidal thoughts for about 6 months now i have always had low self esteem but it have just gotten worse and worse the last couple of years because of some bad choices i have made it started 34 years ago where i would go on online webcam sites and masturbating in front of people i was often high or drunk while i did this and i think i did it to fill out the emptiness in my life i did it a lot for over a year but then i found a girlfriend and stopped getting high 18 months ago i suddenly got very paranoid because i thought someone could have recorded me and put it up online it turns out i was right after searchin some time i found some videos of me masturbating with face and everything since then i have been depressed and cant move on i feel ashamed and gross i feel that people will judge me and think im a pervert my friends says nobody will find the videos and that nobody cares i feel like this will never go away because it may belong to the past but to me it also belongs to the present because those videos are online and and will never go away i dont wanna go outside because i am afraid someone will regonize me from those videos i just cant live like this my girlfriend left me because she cant handle my suicide thoughts anymore she was all i got i loved her so much she was the only person who really understood me but now she is taken distance from me to make her own life better i love her and i am happy that she is happy but this is so hard and i think she has found a new guy the only person i could talk to and i felt loved me for who i am dont want to talk to me anymore i have tried different psychiatrists but nothing helps my thoughts becomes darker and darker and i feel more and more lonely i cant get over what i have done and i am so afraid someone will find it all the time i just want it all to go away i wish i never went on webcam but now i see no way out of this i just want to die and stop the pain please help hello welcome to pc have you

there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting i did also want to address your particular concerns im an older person  as such there was no internet when i was young so there wasnt the possibility of my getting myself into the type of situation you face that said however there are things in my past that in their own way are as disturbing to me as what you have done is to you so i believe i have some sense of what youre facing oh  by the way speaking of suicidal thinking ive made two serious attempts of my own pc member jennifer above asked if you had considered talking to a therapist and i have to say i think this is probably going to be necessary i know you mentioned youve tried a few different psychiatrists and i dont know how mental health services are provided in denmark but where i live psychiatrists almost exclusively prescribe  monitor psych meds if one needs or wants to talk things over at length one has to see a mental health therapist sometimes it can take a few tries to find the right one for you not every therapist works well with every client but talking all of this through at length over a period of time delving into why you did what you did to begin with how you feel about it now  how to live with it in the future is from my perspective what is going to be necessary of course there are also medications one can take to help with anxiety  depression and something like this might be something to consider too at least over the short term there is also a buddhist practice that might be of some help to you both now  in the future its not a cure but it may help a bit as you continue dealing with this it is referred to as compassionate abiding it is a practice i use myself multiple times each day compassionate abiding involves simply allowing intrusive thoughts to come forward breathing into them perhaps even smiling to them sometimes i will even place my hand over my heart as a sign of lovingkindness  compassion for them after a few breaths i then drop the story line whatever thought memory or emotion it is that has upset me  simply continue to stay with the underlying emotion be it fear anxiety grief or whatever until it fades of its own accord which it does two things happen when we employ this practice first very gradually over time the strength  frequency of intrusive thoughts wanes but second  perhaps more important is that we learn we can stay with difficult thoughts  emotions without losing our balance our equanimity here is a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice of compassionate abiding i believe that if you can find a good therapist you feel comfortable with  perhaps learn to work with the compassionate abiding technique over time you will find that you can come out of this successfully it may well still always hurt but you can learn to live with it move on  find happiness in your life there is an american buddhist nun by the name of pema chdrn she has a quite a few books in print it is from reading ani pemas books that i learned about compassionate abiding one of ani pemas first books is titled start where you are a guide to compassionate living shambhala publications i recommend it highly should you have any interest anyway one of the things ani pema says in this book is that in the pursuit of happiness  equanimity a person can believe they are the worst human being to ever have walked the face of the earth thats a great place to start those things about ourselves that we find most objectionable are in reality our treasure or as one of ani pemas teachers the late chogyam trungpa was known to say chaos can be viewed as very good news you can come through this unfortunate experience stronger  at peace i send warm hugs your way with the hope that it might be so okay so this is a bit of a long one for the past few years i have been scared of many things related to doctors to the point of panic attacks and i dont know what to do ever since i was little i have always hated needles no reason i just could not stand them this escalated when i was 9 when i was 9 years old i stabbed my hand with a screwdriver in art class that is when needles turned into some what this is a self diagnosis of a phobia so i go for a few years with barely having any doctor appointments then one day it is time to get some shots the whole phsyical goes fine then it is time for the vacations i was told about it they hand my mom a little pamphlet and go to get the needles i ask my mom if i can see the pamphlet and she hands it to me half way through dr webber comes back in i just wanted a minute of quiet to calm down but that request wasnt heard 5 mins of my mom being upset with me 5 minutes of bribery which just made me feel worse as i felt it was expected of me to do this later and they had enough dr webber asks my mother if she would like him to get someone to hold me down and she agrees at this point in the back of my mind i knew what was going to happen reality just didnt set in until about an hour after it happened i had been held down and given 3 shots that was the first time doctors have shown me exactly how little they care about your emotions as a minor and it is the reason why i hate being a teen when it comes down to it you might be reasonable enough to say wait just give me a minute but no one will care while i have never been held down again there have been multiple threats to do that each time i asked for just a minute to get out of panic attack mode and each time the request was denied ever since those threats i have tried to avoid doctors as much as possible i still sometimes have nightmares about going to get my wisdom teeth out having a panic attack and being restrained and sedated or the same situation but instead i broke my leg then freaked out and was restrained and sedated i still have these nightmares but thankfully no where near as often as i used to the idea of a sedative being inside a needle or iv took what was already bordering a phobia if not one already and made to so much bigger this caused me to start working out and made me want to learn how to defend myself to this day my pediatrician office still wants to do a blood test on me but if they ever try to get my blood without me wanting to give it i will not be the one walking away traumatized for the rest of my life i dont like living in fear of these people and never wanted this in the first place i have never wanted to hurt anyone just save myself from something much worse i know i cant change the world so doctors will still be doctors and not care but i dont even know how to change myself anything is greatly appreciated sincerely jason frederick do you think therapy would help you manage for phobia looking back on this i realize i talked a lot but didnt say anything is there a way i could edit thismake a new article so that i can shorten and revise this you can just make a new article i think only the moderators can edit and delete posts astrada do people usually get therapy for this type of stuff i have only been in talk therapy for a really short amount of time what types of therapy are there and are some better than others i think cbt therapy would be beneficial it would essentially help to rewire your brain if that makes any sense best of luck to you i dont see why everyone recommends therapy when its the medical system thats broken its good to have power over ones emotions anxiety management but lets not forget there are bears in the woods i hate needles i think i mentioned before i pulled the post that i was in the hospital and they were going to do an arterial blood gas test with a long needle and i checked out ama even though my ox sat was so low and i couldnt breathe i think the things mentioned here could really help you like cbt or exposure therapy or therapy in general as ive grown older and had more exposure to needles ive gradually gotten a lot better with it i wish you the very best in managing or overcoming this phobia ive been totally cooped up in the house for over a month a good way of keeping the mileage down on the car if nothing else i realize its an illogical fear  ive been trying to use my dbt skills to fight it but its lingering a few days ago i made an appointment to go out to lunch with a friend tomorrow feeling this would be a good opportunity to break the cycle the closer i get to the lunch with this friend the more anxious i get i know from past experiences breaking the cycle takes place a step at a time taking that first step is extremely anxiety provoking though ill take a few klonopin before going   hope i dont fall asleep face first in my chili but im afraid that might not be enough again i have dbt skills  phamaceutical aids but im still on the verge of having a panic attack im just afraid ill have a panic attack in the restaurant im about to head out in public this morning in less than an hour for the first time in weeks im going with my wife but im still anxious plus i didnt get any sleep last night whatsoever which doesnt help things at all i dont blame you for being nervous but if it helps try to remember that soon enough it will all be over and youll be looking back on it that helps me when im dreading something thats coming up also like you said its a step at a time and it gets easier over time but only by doing it which is the unfortunate part so its to be expected that the first bit will be a little rough also give yourself some credit for taking that first step because its a big deal agoraphobia is a real struggle for me too i was offered dbt skills but i feared i wouldnt be able to leave my flat to go there so i missed out  i missed my doctors appointment because of anxiety and now i have no meds left  i had agoraphobia for several years one day i had nobody to get a medication that was ready to be picked up and i took it one baby step at a time and went to pick it up i was very anxious the whole time this started me taking baby steps and i eventually got over it i hope you find healing and resolution sending big hugs i have recovered from agoraphobia 5 times now but life is cruel and each time its harder and harder to make myself go out into a world im barely able to manage on a good day i have found that a strict schedule with people i trust is the most helpful external support i did go thru a terrible dbt group and ended up traumatized so maybe you were lucky to miss that group i find that rehearsing what i will do if i panic helps reduce the anticipation and taking an emergency phone with me tho ive never used it is reassuring for me the strangest thing was that after the 3rd recovery instead of chemical terror i experienced that freeze syndrome where i would go to the door and just stand there until i realized i wasnt going out no matter what i thought that has been the hardest symptom to fight because its not there so i get someone to go with me or take the paratransit or make special arrangements for some one to get me out of the door once out i do ok generally if something goes wrong with my plans i do tend to panic again but i have rehearsed in real time in real panic what to say to people to help them understand what helps me someplace quiet and alone someone to walk with me to the bus etc generally i find people very accommodating i dont know if they actually understand but their help is much appreciated the bottom line for me was realizing that this is just a brain chemistry disorder a chemical dump from some traumatized glands and nothing to feed catastrophic fantasies to best wishes and freedom for all my agoraphobia has been on the back burner this year because i was locked up in the hospital for over two months then locked in this nursing home for 5 months but im feeling it a little more just recently because im supposed to be going to doctors appointments this coming week i do not want to go unless i understand how im going to get there and back and a host of other worries this is all chained together by free floating anxiety and rebound anxiety from when i was coming off benzos i didnt leave my apartment for anything at all for over a whole 12 months in 20142015 i didnt go out for the mail or anything at all my friend would visit every few weeks and bring my mail in etc i was fine i felt comfortable but the telemed companies stopped giving me refills of meds so i finally had to go to the horrible clinic i hope everyone is free im still locked up lol it sounds like a few of you have had bouts of agoraphobia that last longer than mine generally do im usually out of commission for a month to a few months i probably shouldnt complain im especially sorry to hear of your situation angelique being cooped up for periods as long as you have sounds both emotionally painful  logistically difficult getting the things you need from outside the apartment i hope your current anxiety doesnt develop into fullblown agoraphobia this time take care i got out of the house today i went to lunch with a friend close acquaintance  he shared the fact that hed just come from an appointment with his therapist he knows i have problems isolating so the fact that he shared with me was both generous  put me at ease this friend is someone i know from aa ive been in recovery for years i havent been to a meeting in almost two months because i was anxious about being around people prior to that i was going to 67 meetings a week im going to try to get to a meeting tonight although it sounds fairly intimidating thanks to you folks i was reminded of my dbt skills  now feel able to take baby steps out of this prison of my own making ive had social anxiety or phobia since high school due to a deformity in my chest and been suffering from a skin condition that past year can things get any worse for me hello i noticed that i am unable to determine the right way of action when encountering negative conflict with others example would be whether someone yells at me due to my fault or my lack of efficacy to perform certain task or even when i am not to blame at all especially experiencing how someone yells at me or calls me names without knowing me well leaves me at a loss feeling vulnerable and lose selfesteem because i feel i could fight back to defend my respect as a person something does not let me respond with same negativity or respond physically after situation is over i keep replaying that scenario from memory and think how i would respond which usually yell back or grab offender by throat and threaten him i can forget about whole thing next morning but it seems that i have developed anxiety and panic attacks due to these events as they happened in my life and now it is in my subconscious mind if conflict happened at local shop next time that i plan going there i already start feeling uneasy and anxious when i get out of my house i mostly feel tense and cannot be as comfortable as i am at home is anyone here who experiences this how do you cope in such situations it seems these situations are the root cause that affected my selfesteem and confidence thanks yelling is a trigger for me too i just freeze in fear sometimes not doing anything and walking away is the best thing to do you cant usually make normal conversation when the other persons blowing his or her stack just say i will talk to you when you calm down and walk off even if youre wrong you shouldnt have to bear another persons anger i have this problem also i call it possuming ha i dont think its a terribly uncommon response some of us are just not wired for those confrontational situations i can usually find some relief by writing down what would have been a healthier response maybe even sending a messageemailletter if appropriate but it also helps me to remember that most of the time humans lash out it has very little to do with you fharraige is right  sometimes its a gift to not be too reactive at the very least it usually prevents the problem from escalating and might make the other person realize theyre overreacting i do a great deal of rehashing negative social situations in my own mind too one of the things i do though is follow my own advice to them namely calm down i then try to reconsidered what transpired through the others points of view what perhaps was their own leadup to the situation and how might have they been triggered what could i have done differently only then will i if i feel it necessary or a point to make doing so will i respond email tends to be my preferred choice of communication in such cases fharraige i know that being cool and either not respond or respond in a calm state and is a behavior of a wise man but my problem with this is that it puts you in a vulnerable place because later i will have that feeling that will bother me i would get thoughts that my behavior looked weak to other people who saw me that way and they will have a notion of me being a weak i would think how others would respond i somehow feel that if i responded in defensive manner i would come out victorious and not only think about it anymore but people would respect me sometimes i find that comparison helps a bit i mean i know there are people with worse problems in life and they would wish they would have mine problems and while i understand that i still find it very hard to just forget about situation without rehashing and analyzing it its only after that later that i find peace of mind and slowly forget about it treevoice i wonder what you and others who responded to this post share in common because we seem to have similar if not same problem we that gift of not being reactive as if we somehow lived already through all the situations where we were reactive and learned based on exprience and gained wisdom understanding that polite and calm response is the way justafriend306 so rehashing is what its called in psychology i somehow think that should i have responded in an offensive or at least defensive manner i would be free of thoughts that would make me recall and analyze situation and it would not spoil my mood for the day leaving a sense of selfrespect and selfworth because i did not let some dirtbag to spill their negativity on me you mention that you reconsider what transpired through the others points of view how they responded etc that while being in a situation or after that situation when you rehash what happened i understood that you do that while in a situation but i am unclear how you can do that in such a short amout of time let along being in a fight or flight condition actually you mentioned email so i understand it is all done after conflict in my case i describe occassional situation in a public area where a random dirbag joe doe yells and spill their negativity on you there is no afterward contact or email communication i have used lavender oil and eucalyptus oil with good results the aromatherapy i think works because it takes your mind away from the anxious thoughts while you smell the smells i was very agoraphobic and ii put lavender oil on a scarf and around my neck when i tried to venture out i took sniffs of the scarf to remind me to not be anxious it helped a lot to keep me grounded pick a scent you really like and try it it cant hurt yes it does help a lot but you know whats the worst when you cannot concentrate at the task at hand being in a panic attack and unable to remain calm example scenario when paying small change to cashier while being in such a state due to some jerk you feel as the anxiety and panic build up because you also delay others in line you reach a drained state where you feel the anger of everyone and think what they would think of you being unable to handle such a simple task that involves elementary math being unable to resonate on your level they are now deeming you as a stupid retard i had those moments in life and they really affected my sense of selfesteem and confidence levels on a subconscious level since early years with every such situation i start thinking of future and being unable to handle such such situation as i wish what will happen i dont have girlfriend but what would she think of me seeing how i behave or how about such situation at a dating with random encounter with negative joe doe maybe i think too much but how i behave could determine the outcome of that date or some other important event when will humanity get wiser when will they no longer be selfcentered and learn to emphasize and resonate with others while this gotten better i feel it will still take some good number of generations my teeth were in terrible shape by my early 20s id rather not give details but theyre still crumblingbreakingand worse im going to a dentist in just 2 days and im petrified i too have always been scared of confrontation ive been yelled at publicly at work by people and instead of defending myself i often totally shocked at the events and cant believe its happening i replay the event over and over again in my mind to see what i could have done differently of course i think of all these great comebacks but what goes does it do what we can remember is that if people yell or are not nice with us if we walk away or dont match their loud voice we become the winner in the confrontation because did not go down to their level if we think about that we can realize that we acted in a classier way than that other person z those who participated in this thread described personality and character traits that i share too those are also described in this video whether you believe

tackle a new project or continue an old one take a long shower talk to my family a family member of mine has had a deadly peanutlegume allergy their whole life if they eat a tiny piece of peanut maybe even the dust or consume any other type of legume they can die in like 30 mins if they dont have an epipen to inject to buy them more time or they dont receive immediate emergency room hospital treatment over the course of her life she had a few frightening encounters after eating a peanut or legume without her knowledge in a food shed have to inject an epi pen and go to the er asap these encounters were obviously very traumatizing to her fast forward many years and now she has become very strange and exhibits hypochondriac behavior she will only eat like two foods  meat and plain rice and nothing else for every meal she will only drink spring water from a specific obscure company she is basically allergic to everything now  window drapes movie theater seats etc basically it seems like she wants to live in a bubble protecting her from everything in the world because everything makes her sick it is extremely unhealthy especially her diet and its getting worse as her fear grows she is also getting into alternative medicine from something that seems like a cult from some random leader in arizona there diet and medical advice is very quack like and seems dangerous ive always thought her food allergy is responsible for her increasingly bizarre mental health when one thinks they will die every time they eat that must effect your mental health over the years you cant trust chefs or anyones cooking because they might have touched a peanut or some peanut or legume dust got in the food one would become very paranoid fearful and anxious all the time ive been researching a bit but cant find too much info on it i found one article that seems very helpful but it seems to be a condition that hasnt been studied much here is the paper  i cannot link to the paper at this time because im a new user but its entitled psychological burden of food allergy so you can google it please help me on this subject i fear she will become seriously mentally unstable soon she keeps getting into weirder and weirder unsafe alternative health quackery trying to find a solution and becoming fearful of everything while slowly blocking out the world from my mom i dont have to be by her side all the time i just like knowing that were both home at the same time we see each other every morning before we leave to our separate jobs  every morning she hugs me  tells me that everything is going to be ok after i tell her how im feeling she texts me nearly every day while were at work to check in with me and ill ask her if shes working late if she is i wont see her until the next morning and my day gets worse if she isnt my mood gets better almost instantly any tips on dealing with this i dont want her to feel like she shouldnt take the extra hours because of me have you tried distracting yourself with a hobby or with a close friend it might be good to get something else for you to focus your mind on so that you are not worrying about your mom too much maybe if you and your mom scheduled something like a game night or movie night once a week where you could look forward to that and that gives you a reason to fight through the week until you can just relax without worry might be worth the try kote have you considered going on medication if you already arent kote its nice that you have a good relationship with your mom my daughter just went to a college 2 hours away and we both had to work through separation anxiety she is always busy at school which helps her and i distract myself with friends and activities which helps me as does therapy if at some point the separation anxiety becomes a hindrance or starts impacting your quality of life therapy might be helpful best wishes kote im always super distant but more and more recently i feel like i cannot live another second before i burst or implode i feel this pressure inside me constricting me and swelling form my core to just under my skin hard and heavy squeezing out every now and then when i lose it and break down but sitll remaining it numbs me it eats up my emotions and with every disappointment or anxiety i experience the ringing in my ears gets louder and the pressure worsens i dont even know if this fits in the anxiety forum but ive had gad for a lot of my life among other things so i dont know if its connected but im freaking out because i just want to know whats wrong with me and every time i want to be present and experience my emotions i feel like a freaking balloon flying away from myself hello welcome to pc im sorry you are having a tough time have you ever been evaluated by a professional hello i can relate to what you are going through i often have periods of time where i feel like im about to explode because of the severity of my anxiety and it is super stressful because i have no idea what the do when it happens i agree with jennifer have you been evaluated it is definitely worth it to go on some medications in order to help you out as you work on the rest of it best of luck to you pineapple010 have you asked the therapist for ways of dealing with the anxiety and disconnected feelings can you ask her for ways that would be helpful to ground yourself pineapple010 im not able to concentrate enough on the video right now but i did want to mention an app that i found that has been helpful for me its called breathe2relax i have an android phone so i dont know if its available for ios all it does is help time the in breath hold and out breath you can also adjust the seconds for each in the settings for me as an example i have asthma so i cant breathe in as long or hold it as long because of my lung capacity so i made those shorter and then made the out breath time to where it felt comfortable with the new times for the other two you can also set how many breaths to have it walk you through it looks simple when its open and going but its worked wonders for me it is literally just a line going up as you breathe in and then wait and then breath out as the line goes down so theres a bit of mindfulness too by watching the line and ignoring everything around me mindfulness was one of the hardest parts of dbt for me because of my dissociation i just cant seem to do it sometimes but with this app its easy to do the breathing i think i have a phobia called sonophobia im fearful of fireworks and sometimes im scared of lightning it startles me i dont mind the not so loud fireworks but the ones that sound like bombs scare the heck out of me afterwards i just want to run away from it im sensitive to noise but its not severe are there any tips on how i can cope with this thank you i dont have any advice aside from the practical  getting a soft inexpensive pair of ear plugs to keep the noise down to a tolerable level during storms and fireworks you could also try exposure therapy best wishes when i was 10 i had extreme panic attacks it felt like an earthquake offthescale of the pressure within me i only was able to stare at the ground immovably extremely tonguetied constantly sweating face blushes bright red feeling i was about to melt to the ground like dying fear and extreme anxiety have struck to the core of my being where i was not able to control my emotions at all this happened a lot when i was bullied at school i have been bullied chronically all throughout from primary to high school also due to the trauma at around that time at the age of ten i was clearly suicidal with suicidal intent in front of others at the age of thirteen i was again suicidal in front of my counsellor with suicidal intent repetitively i had suicidal ideation at the age of sixteen and it became clearer when i turned twenty i have dreamed of drowning myself to end my life i have thought of other methods but drowning myself has always been in my mind up to the age of twentyone i had a suicide plan and later i was up to a suicide attempt but then was caught with the police at four in the morning at home after contacting lifeline it was not the first time i have called lifeline i was involuntarily hospitalised for a suicide plan i really hated of being restrained and locked up in the psychiatric ward for almost a month i could have stayed there for many more months though i hated of being dealt with the police and forced to be admitted to the hospital via the emergency ambulance after a visit from the catt team which is short formed for crisis assessment treatment team im sorry you have had such a tough time im glad youre here i was wondering if others experience this lately my anxiety has been so bad that i am always hot and sweating even when its not that warm out at night i lie awake for a long time with racing thoughts and its too uncomfortable to even put the blanket on eventually after an hour or so i calm down enough to need the blanket is being so hot a sign of anxiety or maybe im getting hot flashes earlier than i ever thought i would im almost 38 i imagine that your sweating is caused by your anxiety ive been experiencing trouble falling asleep due to racing thoughts as well as anxiety about the possibility of not waking up on time for my lectures one of my other friends is 19 and experiences hot flashes and she suffers from anxiety so it definitely makes sense to me as a possibility it happens to be quite often especially if my anxiety gets worse anxiety impacts your hormones hence the sweating i know of other people who suffer the same problem i didnt know this thank you i have this problem in relation to my anxiety as well before i started getting a better handle on it i was carrying around a mini fan everywhere dowdythefifth last time i posted here about a month ago i went to the school  study issues part of the forums and ranted about an overlystrict teacher i had from eight years ago who caused me and my other classmates a lot of suffering theyve likely shrugged and moved on since then but i never have i guess i wanted to let it all out but now i feel really bad about doing so what i feel particularly guilty for is revealing the teachers name in that post and why i did it i revealed their name because i wanted to humiliate them to let them know the pain they have caused me i wanted to give them pain and receive vengeance it completely backfired and all im left with is emptiness and guilt in the end i was too afraid to even check if i got any replies let alone read them this has happened many times during my time here i post something then am too afraid of negative feedback or even criticism to read the replies then feel like a complete coward im not sure if having feelings invalidated many times in childhood counts as trauma but if theres any reason why i feel so afraid that must be it i probably will be too scared to read the replies here too maybe i should just leave the site can you schedule an appointment with your dentist to take care of this tooth and get the others checked out 29 does seem young to have this problem best wishes ive felt the same way about fear of reading replies i suspect the replies are going to be criticizing of me and i know its going to trigger me i think about it before reading i ask myself if i want to read the replies because i fear they will cause me an emotional attack then i decide to read them yet a moment before i jump in i say to myself that i must be a glutton for punishment i must be a massochist who wants to be triggered and i am torn between being bold and brave and being ashamed of my self destructive traits then i always read the replies because curiousity gets the best of me i cant resist sometimes the comments trigger me sometimes they dont and they are helpful so no risk no gain im sorry youre having a tough time do you take medication for your anxiety i know first hand how debilitating it can be i hope the 16th gets here quickly for you grath i was pretty nervous at first even though i had no intention of posting anything identifying so i certainly empathize practice has helped a generally supportive community has really helped speaking of which there is tishabuv who was friendly and encouraging in response to one of my earlier harmless but quite silly posts in this very subforum i guess i tend to frontload my anxiety by carefully vetting and editing my posts before i hit submit but i shouldnt worry so much we all make mistakes weve all said things we later regret how about a friendly hug you see now im going to fret over being too sappy  i hope you read this keep posting maybe youll overcome your fear of reading the replies youll find that most of the people on this site are caring and supportive best wishes i agree with jennifer1967 keep posting and yes most people on pc are caring and very wise however please always be ready to hear an opposing view that might potentially challenge your current thinking the thing is if i initiate a discussion on a site and reveal something about myself i need to be ready to hear opposing views not everyone will tell me what i want to hear and that is a challenge we should all embrace know you are not alone im sure many of us feel that sometimes take care i want you to know you are not alone in that i often times will not look at replies to text messages in fear of what could be said and coming on here i was scared to see what some of the responses could have been also other sites i just always get nervous wondering what people will say to me so i really understand where you are coming from and honestly you dont need to leave the site reading stuff here and just expressing are good even if you cant read replies alright ugh the anxiety my therapist has asked me what im thinking when im anxious she wants me to replace those negative thoughts with positive ones about the same thing i think it helps ive been struggling with criticism my boss hates me to my boss is trying to help me i cant do this anymore to im competent and able to complete this task etc yeah the anxiety is a pain i am constantly worried about my surroundings because i feel like something is going to go wrong i wind up looking around myself like a mad man whenever i am out of my dorm very stressful on me i have really bad panic attacks what has helped me most is meds and therapy i also try really hard to focus on mg breathing when having one i hope you find a solution that works for you panic attacks are aweful i have had anxiety for many years and generally live with it so it doesnt impact me too much however since having children there are some things i cant stop fixating on and get really worked up the main thing is about them catching bugs and illness especially sickness bugs they are both in schoolnursery full time and i find i spend all week counting down to the weekend hoping they dont get sick if we make it to saturday morning with no illness i find i can relax some more it especially bad if we have plans at the weekend  i start to panic that theyll get ill and well have to change plans one of my main anxiety triggers this time of year is the worst with colds and sickness bugs last week my daughter came home and told me very excitedly that someone was sick on the floor at nursery and ive been in a constant state of anxiety ever since every night i got to bed thinking ill be woken up soon with a sick little one ive not yet my husband doesnt get it and says i just shouldnt worry if they get ill they get ill and i shouldnt worry until it happens but i cant help it the kids must also think im mad with making them wash hands and using hand gel when were out and about any tips on how to stop this taking over do you feel you have ocd i know with me when my anxiety gets very bad my ocd starts reappearing i do not touch any door handles with my hand because i do not want to catch anything from others whenever i close my dorm door i second guess myself that i actually closed it so i start to worry about that all the way down to the minor things like having a paper being straight on my desk or having everything in a specific place in my dorm it seems to me like you have some ocd tendencies that could be helped by medicine and some therapy some medications for ocd also help with anxiety so it could help you out overall best of luck to you i hope you start to feel better hello welcome to pc i agree with dowdy if the fixation becomes a problem impacting your quality of life therapy would be helpful and possibly medication i also wonder if building new neural pathways would be beneficial every time you start fixating on something picture a large stop sign and replace it with another thought like wearing a path through the snow or wearing a trail through the woods the new thoughts will build new neural pathways and the old ones will start fading over time best wishes i never know how my body is going to react to caffeine theres either no reaction at all or it makes me really anxious and itll last until the next morning so of course the smart thing to do would be to stay away completely problem is i love a latte and this week ive had one or two and i was fine so i thought id risk it today even though i know im more likely to get anxious on the weekend i dont knw why maybe because im on my own the whole day hi anxiety cant say ive missed you heres hoping ill make smarter choices in the future although i guess its also another argument for me to quit sugar i usually buy those iced coffee drinks from the supermarket which contain sugar no more sugar  no more iced coffee i went to decaf best of all worlds and it has a small amount of caffeine to give you a minikickstart but be careful it can still trigger panic attacks if you drink a decaf when you are already anxious i went to decaf best of all worlds and it has a small amount of caffeine to give you a minikickstart but be careful it can still trigger panic attacks if you drink a decaf when you are already anxious it must feel terrible to feel this anxious coffee can be bad and it can only make you feel even worse lattes are yummy but some of them contain up to three shots of espresso which are about 3 cups of coffee in one serving its so hard to give up caffeine but it can be done i went to decaf and then tea but i still love a good cappuccino when out and about just not after midday or i dont sleep breakforthelight im sorry you are having this difficulty i have the same problem if switching to decaf doesnt help you might need to limit it drastically to special occasions lasting all day is a bummer do you have anything prn you can take breakforthelight maybe you can experiment with making your own iced coffee with decaf coffee and fake sugar breakforthelight anxiety is never easy to deal with as jennifer mentioned antianxiety meds can help during those very intense times have you tried any other selfhelp tools for coping with anxiety such as exercise meditation deep breathing listening to relaxing music taking a hot bath reading etc medication can definitely help during those intense times but there are many things you can do to ease the anxiety if meds are not available to you dowdythefifth dowdythefifth dowdythefifth hello i currently suffer from gad among other things and i havent figured out any triggers yet i was just wondering if people who have gone through gad have any tips that you felt helped you the most thank you jennifer 1967 i feel better since ive started the lithium but it is really too soon to tell my pdoc felt it would help with the anxiety as well as other symptoms im also trying dbt  there are a couple of threads in the depression forum here on this site hang in there i cant stand the anxiety i know it is so hard i forgot to add i like gabapentin too for anxiety it isnt addictive like valiumbenzos although it can be abused dowdythefifth sorry this is mostly just a rant does anyone else get so many physical symptoms from anxiety and depression mostly upset stomach ibs and exhaustion that you find it hard to know if something is just psychological or if youre actually sick nauseau and digestion issues have just become completely normal for me since i usually experience some strange symptoms every day or every other day so i ignored my upset stomach while i was grocery shopping figuring it was just anxiety or maybe all the surpressed stress from the past week coming out didnt buy any foods that would be good for when youre really ill but now i think it might not just be a psychological thing as my stomach seems worse than usual and there is no reason for me to be anxious but then i also have emotophobia so i panick easily when i think i might be really sick so then more anxiety rushes it and it makes it even harder to figure out whats going on im not sure if this post is making any sense at all right now but maybe someone recognizes the problem and can share my misery hey yall im katt im 27 and i have never had a license lately ive been having to drive short distances because my husband license is suspended i was doing so well that i thought i was ready to get my license it turns out i was wrong i had to go pick him up from work monday which is about a 15 to 20 min drive with 5pm traffic i could tell the whole drive there that i was breathing extremely heavy but i just kept breathing once i got to his job and got out of the car i had the worse panic attack ive had in awhile thankfully he was more then happy to drive back and let me calm down i guess the good news is i now know how long i can drive for before it becomes too much i am still planning on getting my drivers license soon i know from asking around that the driving test itself consents of just making a loop  only takes about 10min dont let fear keep you from being free techie180 i have ibs and anxiety triggers it 810 times it started when i was 8 my parents would have to carry around pepto if we were on a long car ride because it would make me flip heart racing hyperventilating whole 9 yards ive been on a few rx meds for it however a lot of gi illnesses can also seem just like ibs and can be very harmful if not treated i would see a gi dr to rule out anything else but maybe talk to your dr in the mean time for something to treat the symptoms i know it sucks theres days where im so sick i cant leave the house totally miserable wait why are you driving if you dont have a license driving a car is a huge responsibility if youre that scared maybe you should take a few lessons with an actual instructor instead of driving on your own im sorry this is probably not what you wanted to hear but i am confused as to why someone who doesnt feel comfortable driving and doesnt even have a license is driving a car i do believe that my anxiety has been messing with my stomach it definitely is overwhelming and i know its not typical for me because growing up i was never sick anxiety and depression sure does beat me up physically and emotionally such as whenever one of my lectures is finished i have to go back to my dorm room and lay down for about 10 minutes because of the over stimulation of just being outside and in public well i didnt have a choice about having to go pick up my husband uber wouldnt expect his debit card and i couldnt make him walk 15 miles home the other little trips ive been doing are only like 5 minute drives i usually only drive one way with my husband driving the other  thats because im trying to get more comfortable with driving and seeing what my limits are as well as he has a suspended license tbh id much rather get a ticket or go to jail then have him do so plus its would be my first offense so basically its out of necessity at this point breakforthelight is it possible for your husband to use public transportation or carpool with a friend i get it but its not worth the risk for practice start driving early in the mornings or when theres less traffic and have your accompany husband you once you get comfortable try driving when theres more people out on the road good luck on your driving endeavor awww i think they put you to sleep for that i believe i dont blame you for not wanting that but give it some thought and find a dr that will listen to your concerns and take you seriously are you on any meds some meds made me grind my teeth at first if they were too activating are you on anything for your anxiety i find that if i take my anxiety meds it settles my stomach but ibs is also exasperated by what we eat anything spicy or alcohol can really do a number on you if i go out and drink one night my stomach really reacts the next day i would try following a bland diet and see if that helps google ibs diet good luck and hope you feel better nope not on any meds it could be seasonal autumnwinter is always a tough time for me but ive never had the clenched teen before and overall id say im managing better this year than i did last year so far at least the ibs seems to have calmed down again after the weekend but ive still been feeling blegh all week something different every day your guts act like an extension of the brain with their own complex nervous system so theres no real separation of psychological from physical even use the same neurotransmitters and are affected by many psychoactive drugs including antidepressants i relate but i tend not to put it down to my anxiety coz i tend to think my anxiety is not that bad when i guess it really is hope you feel better take care i made an angry reply to someone because i was annoyed and she told me to get a chill pill thats the only time ive had someone be rude to me but apart from that ive had mostly had a positive experience on here i understand your situation with clonazepam i had the same experience plus it takes longer to kick in than xanax and valium ive tried proprolanol and buspar they didnt work for me i eventually came back to valium 10 mg prn i hope you find something that works for you and helps with your anxiety hello i am new here and a little nervous i am 22and since around the age of 17 or 18 i had this phobia of being a pedophile i dont tell many people because people make this assumption that i am i had this fear because all my life i could never understand how people can be so sick and evil to hurt an innocent child so i said to myself imagine being the most evil and repulsive thing on this earth and presto my fear begun as a college student i never had a relationship with a woman and i am still a virgin so often i get urges i try not to be a chronic masturbator so i do it about once or twice a month sometimes i can go for 6 months without it anyway my fear of pedophiles scare me so much that the unthinkable happens when i fantasize about women during masturbation sick images of kids cross my mind the more i try to refrain from them the more they pop in i never fondled molested or beat a child nor ever intend to as a sociology major i even hope to work with them a lot of children are being taken advantage of and i hoped to look after them some day i once spoke to a college counselor who mentioned the difference between merging reality and fantasy in fact i even got mad because i said this is not a fantasy there unwanting thoughts that interrupt my healthy fantasies i cant figure out if i would never hurt a child why do i feel as if i just committed the most evil act ever ive had it too from my experience i think its my body fearing something in my life whether its about work or at home dont get upset with me but i think your counselor was onto something just worded it horribly i dont think it was meant as a good fantasy no of course you dont want to think of children in that way but consider the existence of a negative fantasy just like how you can have good dreams and nightmares with the umbrella term dreams i think what she mean to say is that this is somewhat of a self fulfilling prophesy such as you are always afraid of thinking becoming a pedophile so when youre subconscious is left alone it remember whatever frequent thought you had it doesnt pick up on the negative connotations you think of it with it just takes the personplacething as it is my phobia is very different from your needles so i dont know if this will help any if you get an image that invades what you planned to fantasize about can you say to yourself ok thats not what i want and replace it with a new image i think by refrainingfighting its on your mind more again im not saying on your mind in a good way which puts the image there also im not a doctor by any sense but to me and my limited experience this almost sort of sounds like ocd or pure o because there is no compulsion behind it maybe some of the therapies for that would help you from obsessing about your fear can you try to focus on the ways in which you dowant to interact with children focus on the healthy behaviours curiosity does this lead you to avoid contact with children are you afraid you would hurt a woman if you were in a relationship with her thus avoiding the area all together your so right tsol i was hard on the counselor i should have seen how she was wording it interestingly enough i do try to replace the image sometimes what calms me down is the fact that i shrug the image off and replace it right before ejaculation thank goodness and yes i now feel that i have to restrict myself around children nor because ill sickly enjoy something but i just get weirded out sometimes i can go6 months with a clear head but even if i shrug the image off its like my subconscious is saying too late your still a bad person i often do feel bad around women like i am gonna do something to dislike me so i keep my distance i dont thing you were too hard on the counselor as a counselor she should have been more careful with her wording you might have better luck with a different one i think if you are already replacing the image the more you work at it the quicker youll be able to get rid of it until one day you will have smooshed it before you even knew what it was do you think being around a place with woman and children would help a busy public place so you dont make yourself too uncomfortable but being in the area and taking note of the fact that you arent having those thoughts do you have other unwanted thoughts and do you have rituals that you feel compelled to perform what you wrote sounds very ocd to me people with ocd often obsess over the possibility of doing something terrible like raping or murdering someone if you do have ocd it can usually be treated with therapy i wish you well although we cant diagnose anyone here ive heard this similar thought process enough to speculate this is called intrusive thought and secretum is correctits a form of ocd called obsessive thinking i highly doubt you would ever harm a child or have desire for a child intrusive thoughts are always involving the opposite of what you would normally do such as incest being gay if the person is insecure with hisher sexuality etc it usually involves taboo or undesirable thoughts  the best example i usually give is  if im taking out the garbage and all of a sudden i imagine myself eating the disgusting garbage does this mean im a garbage eater  well no  so if youre repelled by the thought then you actually dont want to harm children its quite the opposite youre actually afraid of harming children and your mind in playing tricks on you youre not feeling desire for kids  remember these kind of thoughts dont represent your true intentions consult with a therapist and ask about intrusive thoughts youre going to be fine and i dont feel these thoughts are even a fantasy just invasive intrusive thoughts hi av88 just thought id let you know that ive had the same experience as you i started having intrusive thoughts around this very topic as well as awful thoughts of animal torture and thinking i was racist its incredibly frightening and i completely sympathize i havent been diagnosed with ocd but i do wonder if this is whats causing it i hope you can work through this with a therapist thank you for the replys everyone i appreciate it i admire the examples you gave methis explains why when the thoughts come i twitch my head to the side to start all over sometimes when i clear my head i envision a sky with clouds almost to substitute the image and for some awkward reason it helps when i look at the time the time as to be a nice round number like 305 or 510 i never thought about the concept of rituals till recently ive been having severe panic that are so bad that i sometimes i feel even faint or like pulling out my hair any way to calm down cause my meds only help a little and show can i stop them from becoming severe  i hope posting this isnt a mistake ive been a member of psych central for three years but have barely made over fifty posts due to my anxiety of being judged this is one of the safest sites ive seen online but humans are complex creatures and theres always going to be people out there who enjoy sewing discord aka trolls as a result i have barely commented in my three years of being a member here im so frightened of negative feedback and would rather avoid it all truth is a few years ago somebody made a post on this very site describing themselves as the only real person in the world the post got a few comments ranging from cool acquiescence to negativity and i myself made a slightly snappish reply telling them they didnt think of the consequences of writing a potentially offensive post before hitting submit to this day i still wonder if i did the right thing and if i hurt their feelings thinking of my comment makes me feel like i deserve to be judged and condemned i want to talk about my issues but im too afraid but then i thought what if i talked about my anxiety of posting instead still i feel scared right now thinking of what kind of comments i might get ive come out to people in the past looking for help and received only scorn in return i understand what youre talking about to some degree ive kind of had to force myself to be active on this site it got easier after a while even right now im a little concerned that im posting in a subforum that ive never posted in i feel like it isnt my place to just show up and start talking but your post struck a chord with me ive sent a few private messages here and there on pc and even though each one was met with friendliness i still am asking myself if it was okay that i took that step and initiated a conversation im always questioning if i did the right thing or if i just ended up irritating people fortunately the trolls and such seem very few and far between on this site i really dont think anyone will be judging you for making this post im happy you did too if you feel like it some day tell me your story zero judgement here im happy that you posted there will be no judgement from me no judgment from me either thank you so much for the kind responses everyone yes post away this is a very safe environment and i enjoy my time here i think there are a lot of people on here that feel the same but just have never mentioned it i myself end up deleting a lot of posts before i submit them because at times i feel my responses arent overly helpful due to emotional numbing or just not being in a place where im able to effectively communicate what i want to say i had some of the same worries as you but through posting more ive found everyone has been really supportive not one person has judged and even when posts have been a little offensive people have given comments in a really nice helpful way acknowledging that the person who wrote it was hurting youll be fine here post away breakforthelight thanks for the help lynn i have a lot to think about as others have mentioned it would be good to talk about these intruding thoughts with a doctor andor therapist but and this might be easier said than done can you also try reminding yourself what a good person you are ironically your fears of being a bad person actually illustrate what a kind and caring individual you are you want to help childrenthe last thing you would ever want to do is harm them remind yourself if you can of what a kind and caring person you are tell yourself that you are a good person and you deserve lovemost importantly from yourselfbecause its true you are good wishing you all the best av nemo thank you nemo you know when stuff like this usually happens i try to look for a positive outlook but it gets so bad that my mind tells me that because your trying to look for a positive out reach your being bad for looking for an excuse i do appreciate the help hello i know its been so many years just wondering how are you doing did you get a solution to stop thinking negative i have the same issue im 23 years old and i was a victim from a pedophile and 3 to 4 months ago i had depression and suddently i cant stop thinking about how bad a person could be to children now i am thinking of it all the time and im even scared to be one so everytime i see a baby o a child i automaticly think bad things no judgement we are all here to try and be better and to support our peers i encourage you to post often it is part of your support group im glad you are here blue samadhi blue how about this tomorrow you read the forums and post in at least 2 threads saturday bring it up to 4 and sunday 6 feel free to read every post you want but you have to post the minimum for the day mon do 8 tues 10 wed do 12 and create your own thread or two hows that sound anybody maybe wanna tweak it scarlett35 well i am going to be very honest with you you will not be judged but that does not mean that you will personally not perceive a feedback as judgement does it make sense if you are this sensitive of being judged there is a possibility that you might end up thinking that you are judged when in fact you are not on the other hand here is somewhat an opposing view when a member op initiates a thread on pc and reveals something intimate about herhimself the op also has to acknowledge that not every single reply will be what shehe wants to hear there may potentially be some feedback that challenges the ops thinking and it okay in fact i personally embrace a challenging perspective as long as it comes from a caring and a kind place i guess what i am trying to say is that not every response will please the ops ego and that is a beneficial thing we are here for you hello my anxiety has recently gotten super worse everywhere i go i am hypervigilant about my surroundings as in i wind up looking around me and cannot stop that feeling that something is about to go horribly wrong the other day i looked in the mirror and did not even recognize myself because of the bags under my eyes and how scared i actually looked with the social anxiety tacked onto my gad every time i step outside i have this constant feeling of hypervigilance even in rooms that i typically feel comfortable in and know that everything will be fine has anyone else felt this way im even looking around me as im typing this for 12 years ive been getting infrequent episodes of pretty intense chest pain that i believe is totally due to anxiety i went to the energency room the first time in 2005 and they found nothing wrong with me otherwise i can go a few months or more in between having one of these attacks i have no history of any kind of heart trouble i just tell myself that its all mental and will stop if i relax it does  in 5 to 25 minutes the pain is sharp and worsens when i inhale i can always associate it to something i was worried about sometimes it hits when im driving the car and i have to stop and lie down in the back seat im wondering if there is a med that can stop it immediately i wonder what others do about chest pain related to anxiety what brings it on how often do you get it rose please get this checked out properly to rule out a physical cause i am concerned i know we can have panic attacks breathing issues etc but stress can also make us more susceptible to heart attacks stroke ulcers etc so please dont put it down to anxiety go get it checked out ok dont know about meds but anxietyrelated chest pains were one of the first things that welcomed me into the world of mental health problems ive dealt with them since 2008 and i too have gone to er multiple times and been told its stress i have a number of different types that affect me and one of them has been the sharp pain on the inhale mine however have been at random and dont always have a clear emotional root to trace back to still general stress is usually the culprit ive actually gotten quite used to it i used to curl up in a ball and despair but i guess ive learned over the years that it isnt going to kill me and i can kind of take it in stride i can say with utter certainty that the extreme emotional reaction to the pain made it feel a lot worse at least for me this isnt to say you shouldnt have it checked out of course since you only had it looked at once a while ago but i do get this too hi rose76 ive been told the same thing as bjornen quite often that its stress related and so most people have suggested that the way to cope with it is breathing exercises or yoga sitting up straight and focusing on your breathing i cant remember how this helps but i think it may be because youre distracting yourself from the chest pain and putting your attention towards breathing i agree that the emotional response to the paindiscomfort can make it a lot worse so its best to keep yourself calm there are medications which work with your arteries but i think this may be related to heart trouble rather than anxious chest pain but im not sure if youre worried about this please consider a check up sometimes overthinking brings on stress or anxiety which causes some irritationdiscomfort for me i hope it all works out okay and isnt anything to worry about rose76 ive experienced it quite a lot when i was younger like you they were quite sharp and if i concentrated on relaxing they subsided but then when i was much older i had a massive chest pain where i could not move lasted about 12 hour very scary at the time i really didnt know what they were take care it is amazing to me that a kind of vague mental cause can result in such a specific sharp pain in a specific body part i wonder if there is any theory about how the chest gets such a feeling i wonder if its a muscle tightness or what its in the chest and its so severe inhaling hurts but it goes away from just relaxing the mind i would love to know the linkage also why this symptom at this time of life until 2005 anxiety  which i had all my life  never did this i guess no one knows thanks everyone for the feedback seems you know what im talking about ive been checked out twice for chest pains the second time cost me an arm and a leg because my doctors office did not know how to connect the ekg correctly and the machine said i had an arrhythmia just what i needed to hear i was told it wasnt bad but i was having symptoms which then of course got worse i took phenfen so it is absolutely possible i could have heart problems that drug combo has killed people pulmonary hypertensionheart valve problems so i went to the top cardiologist in the area and he ran every test and nothing is really wrong just the slightest arrhythmia nothing harmful but they told me to call if i ever faint that cost me more than a couple thousand dollars for just my copsys and coinsurance sigh anyway yeah my chest pain is just anxiety my chest gets tight like i cant breathe but its only hurt on the inhale a couple of times im glad you got this checked out to make sure it wasnt something else anonymous44086 visteral was like a sugar pill for me no relief at all some people have luck with it because it makes them tired and calms them down i know over time hydroxozine is not the safest drug in the world i have had bad chest pains n shortness of breath from anxiety in the past i calmed myself by walking outside and listening to the sounds of nature while doing diaphragm breathing and muscle relaxation later  i went back inside and inhaled some lavender essential oil that was how i dealt not saying it will work for you just letting you know what i did in hopes at least part of it may help i have felt like that  im actually feeling like that now as in constantly keyed up or on edge then it manifests in different ways for you its being super aware of your surroundings for me ibbecome super aware of any physical sensations health anxiety they are both results of the same thing though you are not alone hello i am beginning to realize one of my issues is selfworth i know im worthy i just dont feel worthy if that makes sense there are two things that bring this to the forefront for me right now 1 i am looking for work and i want someone to want me to see me as having the potential to be a valuable employee 2 i am wanting a relationship with someone im in the dating scene so to speak online mostly again i meet people i like but its wanting someone who really wants me too what bothers me is that i had a professor in my past who saw potential in me who hired me as a masters student and then i became overwhelmed by my thesis work i made many mistakes they lost faith in me and i lost faith in me it makes me wonder who would want me do i want me why should someone want me i really love nice scents and aromas i indulge that by buying scented candles right now im burning pumpkin spice and apple cider i was thinking of buying a set up to heat essential oils if you can do that i happen to not like the smell of lavender reminds me of bug spray i do love vanilla and lilac and lits more i think exposing myself to a strong nice scent might possibly speed up me getting rid of chest pain when it happens that never before occurred to me thanks for the idea can you get essential oils at walmarts or only at specialty stores loving yourself for your limitations or in spite of them would help selfworth is an inside job you have to know youre still worth being alive and well even if nobody says you are youre a good person and you have worth if you can afford a therapist you can work with them on that we can also support you with positive stuff but you have to believe in it yourself thats going to take some conscious effort in revising how you think and feel i used to live a couple of hours from midland and wanted to stay in michigan but had to leave because there was not much going on jobswise i dont know how much things have improved but im sure its just hard to find work around there bad experiences with one job doesnt mean you cant do other totally different jobs and doesnt mean you wont be able to get any of them employers dont know what you did wrong at this other job datingwise i feel very worthy but dont feel wanted at all i agree you want someone who wants you back and at least as much as you want them i feel like thats not going to happen though i dont want or need a pep talk on it thoughi am accepting it personally i think there is a big disconnect between wanting people who are worthy and how people are actually choosing people who arent so i could never take my dating issues to be a reflection of my worth people seem to be picking others based on things that have nothing to do with being a good person or a good potential mate hi rose  can you please clarify for me is it real pain you feel or a super fast heart beat  i had a chest pain once  and my heart was going like a trip hammer  my jaw hurt  it was hard to breath and i was shoveling snow at the time but my left arm did not hurt  it felt completely fine i went in the house  took some anti anxiety meds that were prescribed  laid on my bad  on my back  and i remembered breathing slowly  although i wanted to breath fast as i slowed my breathing i noticed that my heart rate was slowing and my jaw did not hurt anymore  i could breath fine i got up and felt ok  but did not go back out to shovel i called my doctor the next day for an app and he sent me to the hospital for an ekg  and it showed i had damaged  ever so slightly the outer musculature of my heart  nothing really to worry about as the damage was so slight  non the less  my doctor called me back in and said  what did you do   i told him shelving snow  he said perhaps you should let someone else do it for a while i did  for a while  but now i am back shoveling snow again  i dont want to have a heart attack  so i take it easy  and be careful if my story sounds anything like yours  my story happened over 20 years ago  i am still here i suggest  just to put your mind at ease you either contact your doctor or go to the er and tell them what happened and they most likely will give you a simple ekg  no dye  no pain  just a few suction cups here and there and a couple of minutes later  you will be on your way home good luck  and take care  keyplayer i have difficulty with self worth on a daily basis some days are better than others but the prevailing feeling is not a good one at it has led me down many a wrong path and will probably again also have sa get very little panic attacks but a lot of dread in any situation so i avoid and stay inside out of harms way most of the time for me its real pain it does not involve ne sensing my heartbeat at all ive had that pounding heart beat experience a time or two when i got really scared this is completely different it feels just how i would imagine a heart attact or angina to feel its like deep inside my chest right in the heart area is being squeezed very hard or like if someone were standing on my chest i had contused ribs once from an auto accident its kind of like that only worse i even tried taking nitroglycerin to see if it helped it didnt thanks keyplayer i did do all that you recommended what you describe experiencing sure is the classic description of a true cardiac episode  especially the jaw pain    and that it was brought on by shoving snow ive never gotten chest pain from any form of exertion keyplayer i hope you will get into an exercise program designed for cardiac rehab you need to have a close relationship with a cardiologist every winter a number of people men usually die from overestimating their snowshoveling capacity please dont be one of them slight damage to the outer musculature of the heart im a nurse and that explanation sounds odd to me ive not heard of any damage to heart muscle ever being described as slight im not doubting your sincerity but people often mishear what doctors tell them especially since docs often dont explain well do get yourself to a cardiologist cryptsofthemind does anyone else experience this seems to be coming back for me hard to explain like maybe getting hit with jolt of electricity not on medication try and bite the bullet and go to the dentist the thing with teeth is the longer you delay often the problems worsen and cost increases i dont know anyone likes going to the dentist i certainly dont and it makes me anxious but not as bad as some people experience for example my friend has to take a valium before going to dentist the thing is your teeth are really important and are important for your health hope i dont sound too motherish good luck angelique67 does anyone get this where you have a constant pit in your stomach and you cant bare to think into the future is this a part of depression or is it anxiety yepall of the time i dont know what it is i can be both anxiety and depression are my battles im never really sure if it starts out as anxiety and then i run my brain down to depression or if its reversed and both together  i believe in many cases they both go hand in hand i went thru a really rough period a couple months back and could not pull myself out of it  we changed my medication a bit so i could get through  the anxiety was kicking my butt that helped me  i still tackle the same challenges but i can take care of them without that dread in the pit of my stomach yes i have it all the time sometimes mornings worse than others my pdoc refers to it in my case as negative hypomania i dunnoits anxiety or depression or something caused by haywire neurochemicals and stress overload i cant remember when i didnt have that feeling mine is definitely anxiety once during an emdr session my t asked me to envision what it looked like and the first image that popped into my mind was a black rotten walnut with an evil face after that one day my t shows up for my session and gives me a black rotten walnut she found i carry it with me everywhere i go and look forward to the day when i can let go of it and smash it with a hammer my hope is that when i do that it means i dont need to feel that way anymore jennifer 1967 this thread is 3 years old anyway that dread feeling is absolutely horrible and is anxietydepressionand could also be a dysphoric hypomania as someone mentioned what difference does it make how old a thread is especially since the topic is still relevant i get this often i believe it is the assumption that something bad has to happen if you have been doing a lot of good things lately taking care of your problems making progress you have a underlying assumption that something bad has to happen my therapist said that this is a way that we attempt to control the unknown way in which bad things happen this often manifests itself as assuming something physical will happen my uncle had a cardiac arrest at 42 out of nowhere the arbitrary randomness of it was very frightening to me because he seemed to be getting his life under control there is no scientific basis for thinking that the same will happen to me when i start to get my life in order but the fear remains hi i know i am not well and think i was trying to ignore it but i can see now im withdrawing and isolating i do this when my anxiety or depression worse than normal what i do is retreat to home  only go and do what i cant avoid and limit contact with others i know im doing this because that is how i handle it less pressure from others or situations or having to explain anything  its protective however on the downside it means im internalising and thats not good but one reason why im here does any one else relate i think im going to have to try and push myself to try engaging  ha ha as if you copied my journal and well lifestyle when i relapse frankly it is already beyond exhausting to be around people when my mood is average it is much more difficult to navigate life with the funeral in my head that is how i usually spend my weekends books poetry podcasts comedy shows and healthy cooking i have to admit i have been isolating myself for almost a decade now it has consequences such as lack of social support luckily i enjoy my solitude but as i said while it is comfortable it impacted my depression in a negative way therefore i have been pushing myself to have dinner with friends once or twice a month and go to the gym every day it is really hard work to push myself to do these things but at the end it helps me handle the dark pit that i pushed myself in thank you for your reply  not glad you can relate but also glad someone relates im never that social anyway but just get worse when im worse anyway i pushed myself to drop in to a friends today i hadnt seen in awhile and had a cuppa and caught up for an hour i managed that ok but then had huge anxiety this evening so glad i was home then it was only an hour but at least it was something  falldusktrain when i am at my worst i also pull away and isolate which isnt tough to do i really only go to work and have no friends so yes i do this as well leod i do this when my anxiety and depression are really bad youre not alone i absolutely relate its common behavior when people feel they cant cope or get discouraged particularly with the combination of anxiety and depression its given the name avoidance when it becomes problematic yes you need to gently encourage yourself to reengage with people and things it helps to work your way up from smaller and easier things im glad to hear you were able to spend some time with a friend i have this as well i am constantly worried something is going to go wrong where i assume it has to go wrong just because of how my anxiety and depression make me feel this persistent feeling of worry and dread makes me superaware of my surroundings the best i can describe it is as hypervigilance this feeling is very taxing on the mind at least for me woundedgirl this might be the silliest question ever but help me seriously i might have to go to a friends birthday related party this weekend shes turning 18 and invited me and my other friend as well as other people i have never met problem is im an anxious mess i dont know if i should drink or what people do at parties do i talk to people or is it okay if i just hide in a corner what do i do help how does one with social anxiety go to a party without being scared and awkward ps 1 i could just stay home but im afraid my friend will take it badly and the other friend i promised to go with would not be happy ps 2 therell be boys there and ive literally never been in any situation where boys are present that isnt school i dont like them and they make me terrified for no reason make me not embarrass myself pls i would discuss this with the dr that prescribed you the meds if you havent already if its not working for you it may be time to adjust dosage or try a new med have you tried mindfulnessgrounding techniques they are supposed to help with anxiety ive has some success with some of them but am bad at sticking with them and recognizing when i need to start using them i get anxious at parties too but have a couple of things i have done i hope these help you one option is to tell the friend you promised to go with or the birthday friend that you get anxious at parties you would have to decide how comfortable you feel telling either one of them by letting a friend know they can help you get through the party if they are truly a good friend it gives you support and someone to be around to help make you feel more at ease they might even appreciate having you help them get through the party too another option is to decide not to go you do have the right to decide and never have to when i do that i try to make sure the person knows it doesnt have anything to do with them a third option is to go to the party and if it turns out awkward find a way to exit without much notice ive left parties by quietly telling the person that i wasnt feeling great and was leaving early i was not able to speak in school until about fourth or fifth grade i was dramatically mute in preschool i remember that i did not feel a single thing i was very detached i just existed without any feelings i got depressed in high school and didnt speak unless necessary and scripted at home or school i wonder if i was scared or detached or both i am angry that no one helped me with these things even though they could see that i was not normal and if it is actually social anxiety or a reaction to home life and terrifying parents i suppose the school environment was uniquely terrifying in its own right and i am wondering how this translates as an adult if i snap away i will forget to do everything and fail out of school etc so i cant detach but also in my social life which is almost nonexistent i dont like to have unfamiliar conversations and new people saying hi how are you is fullfilling enough everything is such a chore now when i talk it feels like sometimes the words are coming from someone else when i handle my parents i gently coach them or i am a steady controlled presence for them where do these words come from they all seem so insincere im very very unhappy somehow i have fallen into the trap of the dichotomy of either being in control or not being in control in reality im never in control its all a facade i feel like im pretending i did not speak in my first years in school i think i did not feel i should engage in conversation at school because i feared the reaction of peopleprobably from abuse experiences i was an observer i had similar anger that no one helped most of my childhood i did have a 5th grade teacher that helped and i wish i had more support like her i learned that i had to stop observing and being so passive i think it takes pushing through situations and those uncomfortable conversations over and over to get more at ease you might be over aware of your words and how artificial they sound but eventually you feel you own your words that has been my experience im coining this phrase cold socializing it means going out to a social function from a period of not being around people frinstance i can usually go to a happy hour straight from work without a fuss im up im dressed im around people theres momentum to continue but i have high anxiety going out on say a saturday night after not being around people i hate it in fact today i took the day off from work and then attended a social function for my work divisioni found it excruciating even after i left my anxious feelings lingeredso much so i wish i hadnt gone anyone relate i sort of relate i certainly get rusty over longer periods of time short term its having the time to let the anxieties rear their ugly head again  bad habits and negative thought patterns sometimes it passes rapidly if i cope well and people are nice enough sometimes it goes poorly and then ill usually feel bad about it for awhile so for me its just the social anxiety and feelings of inadequacy playing their usual head games therefore it needs to be treated that way it isnt my depression as such although the depression says oh why even bother i try to remind the depression that i dont recall asking for its opinion i totally relate im the same way cold socializing i like that thanks everyone for the responses i really appreciate them and they helped i just wanted to add 3 apps that have helped me with anxiety mindshiftvirtual toolbox and calm i hope you find solutions that work for you best wishes hi i was told by my old therapist that theres a possibility that i could have social anxiety disorder i wasnt all too sure about that because ive never had a panic attack before when i see the word anxiety i automatically think panic attacks i know that im socially inept and awkward but i was just wondering if it is possible to have sad and not have panic attacks hi yeah i dont see why that couldnt be possible and anxiety isnt just panics attacks its constant dread and worry for me with occasional panic attacks most social anxiety is people think theyre going to do something embarrassing or faint or something in front of others and just kinda dwell on that or a number of other things just my two cents but then again you could just be shy im a little awkward sometimes too and worry what people think about me  thanks for answering i know for a fact that im not just shy i worry way to much about what other people think about me and other things that go with social interaction hi agoraphobia or social anxiety disorder most often go hand in hand with panic disorder when agoraphobia is diagnosed without panic disorder severe anxiety is felt but not to the level that it propels a panic attack phoboxyl i have social anxiety and i rarely have panic attacks i have social anxiety and almost never have panic attacks instead i just avoid social situations to an extreme degree same herehavent officially been diagnosed but i believe i have always suffered from sad  ive never had a panic attack either ive had social anxiety since i was a toddler almost all my life i never had panic attacks my social anxiety was sufficient to cause me extreme sensitivity and isolation as a child i think that right there means it is a disorder for you also i would say the same thing i forced myself out into the world and i came to seem to function normal at times that doesnt mean it isnt there underneath i think that if anyone has had real social anxiety when they were young they will always have it as a factor to be contended with some years ago i developed something new i began getting pretty serious chest pain when i am extremely anxious about anything social or otherwise i had it two mornings ago worrying about my finances i think people manifest anxiety in different ways anxiety can fuel all kinds of symptoms i dont think that not having panic attacks means you dont have a serious anxiety disorder my anxiety disorder lasted for many years into adulthood before causing the chest pain i think you yourself are the best judge of whether your anxiety in social situations is a big enough bother to say itthat rises to the level of a pervasive disorder do you plan things you do sometimes based around trying to avoid getting social situations to an extent that just is not normal in cafeterias i was always afraid that if i went to join people to eat they might not want me at their table now i force myself to join others and it has gotten much easier still the anxiety just comes through in other ways i think it is fear of rejection dont let it control you try and do things that seem a bit difficult sometimes you will be hurt tell yourself thats not the end of the world when it happens good luck skyscraper there is no ifs or ands about it social anxiety has a strangle hold on you if your therapist is still mulling this over    trying to decide well  maybe your therapist needs to wake up and pay attention i hate it when people get paid to occupy a chair and there is no accountability to demonstrate in a measurable way that they are assisting you to improve still i been there and done that it seems so nice when you have fear of rejection to have someone in front of you who you dont have a big fear of rejection from that does not mean the process is doing you one dang bit of good only thing that helped me was partial hospitalization cause i was forced to interact with others i had the option of coming home for lunch in grammar school i took that option so it also got me out of recess in high school i spent lunch time in the girls room fixing and refixing my hair and makeup now and then i would go into a stall so my presence at the mirror would seem so constant but i have an ornery streak one day after a year of this i was just so dang hungry i said to myself im getting something to eat no matter what it costs my pride got my tray of food and sat at an empty table oh did that lunch taste good i think i read a magazine while eating i did that for weeks till a nice girl in my english class came and gave me a formal invitation to join her table she kept doing that every day one day she said dont make me come and get you all the time you know where we eat so just come on over she was a rare person and i trusted her and i do hope life has been very good to her she became my first high school friend and it wasnt out of pity i found out she really liked me she was a cheerleader so you cant prejudge people now tears come to my eyes not sure why unlike you i was the belle of the ball in my on home around my own family when you mentioned becoming fearful in you own home i suspected that something else was different i suspected that you had gotten some harsh treatment from a family member that really wasnt my problem then you mentioned that your mom rejects you i thought  so there we have it or a good part of it recovering from parental rejection is a whole lot harder i would think than getting a grip on uncomplicated social anxiety not that it is ever uncomplicated i wont pretend to have all the answers but i have an abusive sibling based on trying all different thinks on that front i would make this recommendation you are going to have to put up a wall between you and your mom thats unconventional advice i know i stand by it all the therapy in the world  even if your mom would go which she wont  is going to change nothing if you can still love her  thats fine your wall can have some windows in it you can watch her through the windows let her have a peak at you now and then say good morning and good night warmly to her if that seems to work okay by a wall i mean dont let her engage you on her terms since you are still young that is going to be hard  for you maybe impossible i take it you still live with her i had to do that with my father from about age 16 and i did love my father but he was a domineering controlfreak i was a very wellbehaved kid but just ornery enough that i wasnt going to be controled beyond reasonable i obeyed and respected my father but i kept kind of aloof i kept my distance if he wanted to chat with me and he did because he actually liked me he had to watch what he said if not ild let that conversation become real onesided real soon your ability to refrain from talking which like me your probably real good at can become a secret weapon  your strength learn to simply not comment on something that is said to you that is not said in good will learn that you dont have to defend your decisions to anyone unless you end up in court it might not be wise to share things with mom if she tends to screen what you say looking for something she can find fault with stay with safe subjects  like the weather and dont be overly inviting to let her use you as her captive confidant the library is not the worst place in the world to spend your time it was my second home i came to be a lover of libraries spend your time there well i think youre more brave than you know and less strange than you might think  all humans hate to be rejected with or without you skyscraper oh okay this was very helpful thanks im on ms and i have been bouts of feeling emotional and anxious there times where i could just cry however im situation i have to talk to someone and just the thought of her makes me feel anxious and sad also i dont really have anyone to talk because this situation is complex and no one knows how to help me and the make assumptions sometimes people are just mean and shame me a bit of homophobia going on with someone of these people basically tell me go to a therapist to fix my sexuality people are afraid of what they dont understand techie180 today i had a check from someone that turned to be fraud and then so my bank canceled my bank account due to that and im in pain from teeth implants which both makes me anxious highly and suicidal but no plan just thoughts and maxed out on my as needed meds need some support and tips on how to get through thisthanks jennifer 1967 ive only talked about this to people a few times but i feel like i need to talk about it now and i dont see my therapist for another week i had one of my phobias triggered majorly the other day and i still feel really freaked out by it im sure some of this will boarder on triggering so be warned before you go on i have a pretty serous phobia of semi trucks several years ago i was driving on the interstate going to an internship for school the interstate here was three lanes each way and i was maybe 12 to 1 mile from my exit id moved to the far right lane so i wouldnt have to fight traffic when i got to the exit i drove pretty close to too high over the speed limit at this time and ended up passing a semi that was in the middle lane as i passed him he moved into the right lane behind me but too soon the semi tapped the outside corner of my back bumper as he switched lanes i didnt feel it happen but within seconds i started losing control of my car i fought it hard but lost control and ended up driving across the three lanes of traffic and crashed into the median i was so panicked i remember the day in feelings and snapshots of images still especially scary was one snapshot when i was perpendicular to the lanes of traffic i remember looking out my window and seeing the front of another semi coming towards me luckily i didnt get hit by anyone else and there was a cop not far behind where i crashed who was on the scene almost as soon as my car stopped moving my car was pretty damaged but luckily i wasnt hurt just scared and in shock so fast forward to now yesterday actually i was out running some errands and got to the stoplights at an intersection i needed to turn through i was already pulling into the intersection and the light was turning yellow so i knew i needed to go before it was red i started pulling through the intersection and from the other direction a semi decided not to stop at the red light i froze up it was like a mirror of my memories of the first accident i really cant believe that i didnt just slam on the brakes and panic i was lucky that the semi was going pretty slow and was able to stop before he hit me and i got through the intersection and to the store without any damage to the car or myself i didnt realize that it affected me so much but i started panicking earlier today when i had to drive by a couple of semis this is the worst fear for me to have especially since my boyfriend doesnt have his license so i do all our driving i see a semi truck and im so afraid of them hitting me or doing something stupid that will hurt me i feel anxious just typing this up even though theres nothing to hurt me now i dont know if im looking for any answers or advice or anything i just needed to get this out to someone who might understand thanks for reading leejosepho psychnitrous i was reading a blog online where someone described a panic attack as a dramatic occurrence meaning it would be easy to spot someone in the midst of an attack i know everyone has a different experience when dealing with anxiety but i dont think its necessarily easy to tell a person is having an attack by just looking at them when im trying to deal with all my anxiety im often trying not to attract attention i think having other people notice im sweating dizzy and having a hard time breathing wpuld make it worse does anyone else suffer in silence or is it just me i suffer in silence but my loved ones especially my daughter can tell when im having one its embarrassing and i try to downplay it leejosepho unfortunately i dont disclose my mental illness symptoms as much as id like to for most of my life i would suffer in silence i was able to control my anxiety i was able to fool my therapist and psychiatrist while i was having a fullblown anxiety attack suddenly in the past two months my body wasnt able to control the silence since i gave up drinking alcohol and caffeine this summer my body has gone haywire every time i have an anxiety attack in public many people stare and ask me if im ok i had no choice but to go home i miss the days i had silent anxiety attacks  i have a problem with this too i dont want anyone to know issues been judged and its not nice so i dont do ive always been one who refrains from sharing their feelings and emotions so when my mental illnesses get worse i wind up praying that no one notices me suffering i relate with you on the suffering through panic attacks in silence if i am around others and im having a panic attack where it is not easy enough for me to leave the room i just sit there hoping nobody notices it it surely is stressful on the body to suffer in silence but i know thats all that i am used to doing i practise mindfulness i concentrate on things like where i am what i am holding what i am touching etc  and my relationship to them for instance i may be on a bus i concentrate on everything from the cold touch of the bars and rails beneath my fingers to the feel and texture of the upholstry to the rivets holding it together and so on maybe i am holding a pair of gloves  what do they look like what do they feel like i imagine how they were stitched together and on and on bad emotions are terrible i recommend mindfulness for any emotion why mindfulness is strongly method to clearly illuminate your mind act if you interested in i will more explain about it because i practice and feel about it cold air cold water or an ice pack on you forehead or neck can slow it down before it gets too bad take calming breaths when i feel faint i lie on the floor with my feet up i try to remind myself that although i am acting very frightened i am safe and that the feeling will pass i try to remember that im going through a difficult stage in life but that i will adjust and overcome every new feeling of a panic attack scared me which made the panic attack worse breathing temperature change reassuring thoughts getting in a safe position to recover are the things that help me also try to embrace something that comforts you a memory a picture a pet person pillow etc im sorry you are dealing with this in my experience they get shorter and less intense after youve worked through the thoughtsfeelings that are causing them shortly after youve experienced the worst of them notice how you can feel quite normal again although unhappy youre having panic attacks i dont have a cure for panic attacks but i found knowing the mechanics of them can help also knowing it will pass soon helps you endure you might want to read up or talk to your doc or therapist about what is happening in your body when you have an attack i hope you find relief soon techie180 i have not read through all the replies but will say this anyway i was having major flooding waves of anxiety that would get the heart racing and then i would go into a panic attack the doc prescribed me something that people use before doing public speaking generally it takes away the racing heart i found although this didnt change the anxiety feeling it meant i didnt go into a panick attack it basically stopped the cycle of panic i was in and only took it for a short time id go back to it if the panick attacks started up again its called proponal worth mentioning as a possible help but of course talk to your doctor about it techie180 hi i have bipolar disorder and also occasionally experience almost crippling anxiety as well my doctor first diagnosed it as generalized anxiety disorder and put me on an ssri i think it was zoloft but as we all know ssris can be very bad news for people with bipolar disorder so i had to stop taking it when i get anxious i get severe muscle tension which makes me feel even worse im on clonazepam 1 mg worked for a little while then stopped 2 mg worked for a little while then stopped im now trying 3 mg and it helps a little but not much im sure im developing a tolerance to this drug and i want to stop taking it my question is do any of you know of any antianxiety drugs that are not benzos and are not habit forming an internet search brought up proprolanol and vistaril as a side note i cant take gabapentin because of a severe allergic reaction has anyone tried propolanol or visteral what kind of results did you have thanks for your insight lamictal 450 mg wellbutrin 150 mg clonazepam 3 mg trazodone 100 mg you mention doctor and not psychiatrist you need a proper psychiatrist to be prescribing you your medication they have far more knowledge in such matters as a gp they also have far more experience than you you should not be choosing your own medications this is best left for a professional sorry you cant take the gabbies i took propanololmy daughter likes it but it caused insomnia and i went manic the gabapentin made me go hypomanic but that has calmed down ive started lithium which my doc says will help with the depression and anxiety and hypomania because it is a mood stabilizer i am starting to feel better i guess most people dont really react to wellbutrin but me it made me anxious and physically shaky and tense my normal anxiety does not make me shake had to stop that one vistaril made me tired not at all calm i also wish there were non addictive anxiety meds doesnt seem like anyone made an attempt to make one in a long while buspar is the newest and it is over 30 years old chuck1970 hi ive been suffering really bad anxiety for the past several months one of the symptoms im having is pushing my tongue hard against the roof of my mouth all day im pretty sure its anxiety or stress related i asked my psychiatrist about it she increased my klonopin but that hasnt helped at all i asked if it might be a lingering effect of the tardive dyskinesia i had she said no she seems puzzled by it and wants me to see a neurologist i cant get an appointment for over 2 months this is unbearable i wake up with it and have it all day and all night and nothing helps i know this is weird but has anyone else experienced tongue tension like this i hope you get some answers im literally doing this right now but i recently got a retainer i guess mine is part habit part anxiety i am also currently anxious and am waiting for my ativan to kick in it sucks ive had a nagging cough for weeks now ive seen the doctor and it has only since gotten even worse i feel 100 but i just cant stop coughing and how does this have anything to do with my mental health a great deal actually i am completely humiliated by it it is triggered primarily by talking so i have avoided doing anything where this might take place i am extremely selfconscious i have a constant running commentary in my head about how i draw attention to myself for having faults with everything naturally i am incredibly conscious then that i might make people uncomfortable laugh at me or even be angry this dang cough has caused this so much so that it has ruined the last several weeks of my life  all because i am afraid of what people might think of me i am embarrassed to speak on the phone this means i cant speak with my boyfriend and others i cant go out without feeling that all eyes are upon me i am moving in a week and am turning down offer after offer to meet friends before i do so i am even turning down lunch with my son i should be able to say the heck what others think but this is not in my nature if only i had the where with all to do so all that i can think of is that i will be the subject of scorn and ridicule i often hate things that draw attention to me or could potentially be irritating too what did the doctor say could it be phlegm or allergies hope it isnt brought on by stress you could try cough drops to tackle whatevers causing the coughing when youre out and about and talking and stuff i went through this a few months ago i know exactly how you feel i had acid burn my esophagus and coughed uncontrollably for weeks i felt embarrassed going out and about because it felt like people were staring putting multiple cough drops in my mouth at once and keeping water on hand helped a little i hope youre coughing ceases soon i had coughing fits once i went to the college doctor and they told me to take sudafed i didnt think that made sense but it helped postnasal drip they said it was several brands have been ineffective the prescription narcotic cough suppressant has done nothing but cause halucinations and space me waaaaaaaay out at least i sleep well i have been sucking on drops for weeks i have an inhaler from the doctor and am breathing free and clear yet still the tickle in the throat persists i am not answering my phone i really need groceries but am avoiding leaving the house i am that concerned about being the unwelcome centre of attention thanks for the kind words and suggestions so sorry you were told this my husband often tells me to calm down it really pisses me off like oh i didnt think of just calming down what a simple solution thanks for that i never tell anyone in my real life about my anxiety except my mum who just tells me calm down and you have nothing to be scared of obviously i already know that doesnt stop the anxiety dear justafriend306  im so sorry you are experiencing this and i completely understand even though ive not experienced it myself my son had coughvariant asthma for 7 years when he was little and had horrible coughing attacks and i know what it is like to not want to go anywhere  afraid of the stares glares and comments of people around you i used to think that everyone thought i was the worst parent in the world for taking my horribly sick child out in public and subjecting everyone else to his germs but really it was inflammation from a cold he had 3 or 4 weeks ago and he was no threat to anyone i cant offer much in terms of solutions  keep using your inhaler rest and hopefully it will improve please know you are not alone in enduring others judgement its hard and its painful thank you i cancelled my psychiatrist appointment for this coming week there is no way i can manage an hour long conversation in the meantime i have pulled out some of my cbt work things like listing off in what way my anxiety could possibly be helpful and decatastrophizing my thinking its not trivial if you feel this is really hampering your life i would think if your doctor checked you out maybe you are allergic to something or i would have a second opinion to see about the root cause of your cough try not to worry x sounds like you should go and see your doctor they will calm you down and talk you through what to do next thank you my appointment is the 30th of this month i cant wait to go lol i need something to help thanks again for reaponding okay so i have been going to school for 2 years now studying accounting i am close to graduating if all goes as planned i should graduate in may 2018 i have good grades and i am on the dean list i have struggled with depression off and on all my life from 2010 to 2015 i worked at a doctors office job that was a complete nightmare from time to time i still shudder at some of the bullying i went through there i want so much to be successful in an accounting job right now i work a parttime job in a dry cleaners it is an easy job and its like working with family i like this job but it does not pay a living wage it is not a career i want to do well i also have to be the breadwinner in my household i am so afraid to fail again i am 55 years old and i am too old to keep failing i must succeed this time but i am so scared you have done well in school so you have the education anxiety tricks us into focusing on what might go wrong imagine all the positive things that can and likely will go right you graduate on the deans list you find a better paying job and become the breadwinner accounting becomes your new career you can do this this is why you are working for it trust yourself fear of failure is a tough thing to have because it means your at the fork in the road on one side there is the goal its the side of the fork you want to take but then when there is the fear of failure it drives people to go to the other side where they give up or never even get started the funny thing is going to the side of giving up is immediately bringing to life what the person feared all along  failure the only chance to keep that fear from being a reality is to take the tough road and follow through which you already are i know how it is to not be able to shake the fear though ive been going through it myself i wasnt able to shake it so i redirected it my fiance and i are working on getting a business of the ground right now at first i didnt like the idea of it at all purely because of the potential of failure but i decided to try to make myself feel fear of not trying my very best to make this happen fear of quitting again sort of redirect my perspective of the fear now all my fear of failure is gone once we get off the ground if we fail we will be losing a lot of money but im not afraid of that anymore im actually looking forward to being the me that didnt give up and tried my best without being afraid of the end result if you can try to be excited for the end result not afraid being afraid of something in the future is assuming that your fear  in this case of failure could be part of the future but you dont know that so you can choose how to look forward to the future try to work on looking forward to the future with excitement and anticipation not fear and worry if you can congratulations on how far youve come fellow accountant here i can see where you might be anxious about the future but all indicators are that youll be successful graduating in may good grades the deans listall great news ive been in nightmare jobs before bullying and also struggle with depression on and off its tough but youll have your education in a field that offers good opportunities to fall back on best wishes and kudos that would be a bit awkward i suggest you just try to act like nothing happened unless they say something was it related to something at work though i am old to be a student but better late than never oddly i found my chance to go to school and study accounting which i had been talking about doing for ten years at a time when i was unemployed i feel like having an associate degree under my belt gives me more options in life before i always felt stuck not going anywhere i wont give up i will keep pushing on and pray to overcome anxieties thanks everybody for your support just want to say your inspiring me to go back to school i too am older but kinda stuck in a dead end career i want to be better when i have to deal with people sometimes they still do they certainly did before my diagnoses i get caught up on anxiety even online i cant stand playing a multiplayer game even a coop game my stress spikes as if im on stage i collapse into selfdoubt and terror even on say forums im afraid less so those are all conditions people do not understand my reluctance to take part in even trivial things the extent of my anxiety may be complemented by other psych issues but i think they are general enough that people who experience that should understand i often get that response from friends and family often theyre right and sometimes theyre incorrect its hard for people who dont suffer from mental illness to relate to those going through things its really frustrating and ive had to consistently deal with situations like this even to this day i am prone to anxiety and panic attacks as well lately ive developed this thing where i just have to check things let me explain im a ride operator at an amusement park and every day the rides go through several inspections as the operator i do the last inspection and open the ride there is a sheet with a bunch of boxes that we check off if its working say if the fan works we check the box that says so then we sign it and check off that the ride is ready to open lately i have this thing where every couple hours or so i need to check the inspection sheet and makes sure i checked everything off that should have been and that i signed it and filled it out properly even after checking it once i feel the need to check it again later on also when i go hiking i feel the need to stop and make sure i have something in my backpack that i need checking for my car keys are my most frequent stop ill be walking and my brain says i dont think you have your keys with you you gotta see if theyre still in your bag and ill keep on walking because logically i know the keys are in there theyre not going to jump out on their own but after a few minutes it drives me crazy because what if i forgot them in the car or dropped them last time i opened my bag so then i check and sure enough the keys or whatever i think im missing are there and then ill walk a mile and go through this again if i dont check my anxiety rapidly increases as time goes on this is new for me and i really dont like it do you experience something like this do you know of anything that helps should i check the things sooner to avoid the anxiety increase or should i hold out for as long as i can what exactly is happening if you do what your feelings tell you which is to check and check you will spiral down into the ocd swamp the right thing is to do what your reason tells you not check when it is unnecessary that might help the illness from progressing helpful article sorry im not much help but want to say yes this does sound familiar there is an aspect of my job which requires quite extensive checking and i have to fight to go back and double check sometimes i dont win and so i do but i am time limited for the task so cant too often i also check other stuff my belongings etc locking doors its difficult ive been trying hard to not continuously check everything today its driving me nuts because i want to make sure my car is locked but i am at work and its a 15 minute bus ride back to my car im also refraining from checking the inspection sheet as well basically im an anxious mess today if youre in the beginning of your ocd career it would make sense to look for some specialized therapy for that issue behavioral therapy not cbt it is much easier to stop in its initial phase than later on so this year i have been suffering from anxiety i realize that now i took a weight loss pill this year that has ssri like effects each time i would take the drug i would feel happy and nothing would really get to me while on the drug i had fuzzy thinking while off it i was clear thinking and overwhelmed with anxiety i have realized just how much of my weekends have been spent worrying about my cat i mean i cant go a weekend without thinking there is something wrong with him which always turns out to be nothing do you know what that is like to obsess all weekend that there is something wrong with him and half the week going to work makes me too busy to worry about things then i keep imagining scary things and acting accordingly in late august i became obsessed with being a prepper some of it was due to the north korean thing but once i took the drug again it all went away now of the drug it is coming back i hope this is just a side effect of getting on and off the drug but i dont know how i am going to do it im getting tired of this problem where im anxious from a dream right before waking i ended up sending dumb emails because i was anxious upon waking and not thinking clearly yet anyway its been going on so long now i cant remember when it started anyone else with this i think i sometimes do this when in high stress and im not aware of having a brain injury i cant figure out why i cant find something or do something and it will go on long enough for me to get irritable about it and even ask my mom about it and then i discover i should have found it or figured it out right away pretty sure my mom does it too during 2016 when i was dealing with some trauma in therapy i would wake up every morning for a while knowing my extreme anxiety was caused by anxious dreams but usually not remembering the details of the dreami tend to remember more details towards the end of an ordealanxious period i would wake up with a severe panic attack and sometimes it would take hours for it to settle down i dont know if this describes any of your anxious feelings in the morning or not sometimes my dreams are disturbing and i wake up quite stressed and anxiousand then to get past that i carefully and methodically sort the thoughts and feelings to cull the irrational ones and get back to dealing relatively well with reality i get night terrors sometimes where i run down the hall screaming it happens when i am dealing with stress in may i saw a very disturbing scene in the movie reserver dogs and i had a night terror less then 2 hours later i just wake up really anxious and scared it happened at 630 friday morning because i was anxious about my dentist appointment at 830 sometimes i just wake up scared out of my mind with my heart pounding without having any bad dreams i think that usually happens when i take a sleeping pill key tones key tones key tones yes i just want people to know i dont enjoy it and if i have it stop asking if i took my meds or need them tweaked or the husband losing his temper he says get over it usually when i calm down i tell him why but he still gets upset with the panic attacks i think only the therapist gets it though during this mood i am not calm im extra sensitive so any thought or physical feeling comes into my head is like a jolt of energy and its too much energy i cant handle it regardless if its a bigsmall thing or if its positivenegative doubt its fight or flight examples food from dinner still on my teeth normally this is fine but in this mood makes it worse more intense having softpremature bowel movement smells more that smell is makes my intense mood way worse wanking normally wank fine but in this mood when i orgasm yeah no way its like that jolt of energy again its too much and makes the mood worsemore intense but youd think having an orgasm would do the opposite judging people if a thought of someone pops into my head and maybe i judge them somehow even if someone i like jolt energy 86 bpm heart rate sometimes 90120 but that seems more rare need more data maybe normal condiitons food on teeth is fine wanking has always been normal judgement not saying juding people is the best thing but under normal circumstances i may be judgemental and thats the end of it 78 bpm heart rate after eating and 90120 after workout workout can be a bowel movement  mood trigger too but it was never a trigger before all of this started softpremature bowel movements are a trigger its the bowel movement feeling not the movement itself which is trigger can happen without bowel feeling but its a bit rarer perhaps its interfering with gut chemicals but thats a trigger so possible exception to the examples above if im out somewhere and people fight and i freeze once the fight stops i walk around for a bit with jelly legs so thats freeze or fight or flight all adrenaline related i do not have jelly legs with this mood i can still walk around can usually drive cant sleep with this mood even if bone tired drift off start dreams wake up in 5mins once the mood dies out or passeswhich can sometime take 6hours then i can sleep easy so it doesnt stop sleep chemicals but it does stop from falling asleep same with appetite appetite can come back once this mood passes going and seeing a friendfamily member usually stops this mood in the moment unsure why release of endorphines when i see these people that i trust and bond with am i just low on endorphines hi p  i am not a doctor  however i would classify you as mildly to moderately depressed and possibly slightly anxious are you see a therapist  do you have the means to see a therapist  if so they can be a great help your bms are normal  your heart rate is fine  you should however brush after every meal just to save your teeth if nothing else cant sleep  could be either or you seem to be concerned about your bms  dont be they are fine have you talked with a doctor  here is my advice  carry on and see if your condition get worst  you are not in a trauma state now  i can tell you that also it is normal of bowel consistency to be a bit off  and your heart can withstand beating 200 bpm for one week straight  and you would feel no pain  you would notice your heart racing  however it would not cause any permeant damage to your heart  it would feel strange yes  but painful no it would scare the pop out of you and most people  but in the end your would be just fine i think something happened in your live recently that is causing mild distress and that is leading to your symptoms my suggestion  see your doctor or stop by a minute clinic  get the word from them if you are still a bit off seek out a therapist if you can or just talk with a friend or close family member of course we are here to help as well  so glad you stopped by lighten your load  you are fine  but just get checked out  take care  keyplayer when you say you are very anxious about something do other people act like youre being ridiculous i was told by someone today to just pick up the phone and make a call instead of panicking kind of hurt having my anxiety minimized like that my mom tells me im being ridiculous when i get anxious but usually i am and i often worry for nothing things usually work out for me the way they are supposed to i almost died when i was 45 i was choking on a piece of hard butterscotch candy instead of running to my mom i ran to the living room i remember lying on the couch and i was just about to close my eyes when something told me to go get help so i ran to my mom who did the heimelic sp and got it out that was 20 years ago i didnt realize until a year or two ago that i was about to die i know i should let it go but it still scares me how should i get over this sorry if i scared anyone  people make fun of my possibly anxietyrelated health issues they tell me im just a hypochondriac but i really do feel physically very sick which causes me to be afraid to do things like have a drink or even just go out because im scared i will make the symptoms worse or just be very bad company because i feel too bad to be fully present one time my sister got mad at me about something so she started mocking me walking around being like oh i feel soooo sick that was 5 years ago and it still hurts so bad thinking about it i didnt choose any of this im crying writing this its so awful i wish i knew how to make it stop i know people dont understand it especially because it is intermittent i really mean it when im so anxious i cant shop and need help people dont understand the feeling and cannot relate you cant expect everyone to understand exactly what having anxiety is like for you they likely didnt see it as minimizing your anxiety they likely do not even know what a comment like that could do to someone with anxiety but thats the thing you do what you will with that comment once its done said and passed you found the comment to be insensitive of the difficulty you were having but you dont have to see it that way or think that far into it but anxiety can definitely make one more prone to pick at such a moment ive personally come to accept when i end up looking foolish or ridiculous to others because i know they do not live in my realm of conciousness so their reasoning can not and will not factor in correctly what they do not know or understand about the core of who i am just like my perspective of them will be flawed as well because i am unable to factor in what i dont know about them or what i do not deeply understand in regard to the things i do know about them i can only assume the true depth of what someone else is going through because of that persons experiences they likely assumed the phone call was no big deal and they expressed that if they ever lived in your shoes for a day they probably wouldnt have said that i wouldnt want to live in a word where everyone tip toed around in every conversation in fear of saying something that supports their own thoughts feelings and experiences but conflicts and upsets someone else because of their own life past feelings etc however if that person wasnt trying to be helpful and encouraging about it when telling you to make the call than they dont really have a right to tell you what to do no matter someones perspective being rude and bossy about it isnt the right way to go jennifer 1967 in general i tend to suffer alone because i dont want anyone trying to guide me out of my panic attack whenever they do i perceive just a hint of condescension from them which i translate to youre being ridiculous i still remember a breaking point from childhood i was 12 suffering from extreme anxiety sobbing because i couldnt understand this impending feeling of doom my mother otherwise a nice gentle person snapped and yelled at me stop being a baby that broke something in me and i stopped asking for help and comfort from others then and there bjornensomething similar happened to me that is awful people just dont understand how painful it is and made worse by no one understanding i really needed comfort in that moment like never before it was an incredibly unbearable to feel so alone anonymous50013 i honestly think it is very rude for a person to make such an insensitive statement when they know you have anxiety they know exactly what they are saying there are no excuses for just being flat out rude ive had this before too and its like how would they feel if they were the ones with the anxiety and someone made a nasty comment i feel i am always explaining the justification for my anxiety sometimes all i want is some validation i realise with some angst that i do this here too my husband often expresses exasperation with me too i dont blame him it cant be easy living with such a worrier my mother understands she has anxiety too i either inherited or learned it i have a few other friends who have experienced it and understand i do think its to do with personal experience so i went to los angeles this summer to visit my sister we had an amazing time she introduced me to weed and we got high togther many times one day we went and bought a 300 mg edible and i ate the whole edible me and my sister knew that these were the good times and that we would remember these good moments i was already a nostalgic person and i would cry sometimes and hug my sister so the night i ate th he edible i was already high but i wanted to get higher we went to chick fil a too and we ate i laid down in bed and i out of nowhere started to cry then after that i threw up and i became extremly confused not being able to understand anything i started saying im sorry god and my sister was telling me that im in la and i just took an edible i then just laid down and fell asleep next morning i felt weird like nothing was real no anxiety just a weird feeling we went to disneyland that day and i just felt like nothing was real it went away tho i came back to north carolina after my one month vacay at la i cried because i love my sister and it was a great vacation my sister sent me a weed vape pen because i just thought it would be nice to smoke some weed i smoked it a few times until one day i panicked for no reason but it wasnt as intense as the one in la so i brushed that off and decided to not smoke weed anymore i felt derealized again too but it went away i then said to myself okay im just gonna take one puff of my weed pen i got high but deep down i was anxious that i might get another panic attack so all that went away and i just brushed it off me and my sister listened to the jay z 444 album during my la vacation i decided to listen to it again i listened to a song and i started to panic for no reason and i knew i was panicking for no reason this happened probably 3 weeks or a month ago ever since then ive had anxiety for no reason i would have weird feelings in certain lighting mostly fluorescent lighting i started to worry that i might be going crazy aswell sometimes i look at myself and sometimes im just like wow thats me and recently like 2 days ago i started to worry and think i started to think about how i go to school everyday and how its like a loop i started to worry and i hate it because ive never thought like this before and i hate thinking like this i would at times feel better during these past 3 weeks but then it would come back its so annoying the day i listened to the jay z album i also started to think a lot about faces and how they have 2 eyes and stupid  like that that went away though i fear sometimes when i fee better if he anxiety will come back i hate this guys i just want to feel better i wish i never smoked that ing weed i wish i never smoked that stupid useless weed please guys i isnt want to feel better ive noticed that all this anxiety is stupid as  and that my life is great i have the bestest of friends who have been helping me out i cry sometimes aswell i cry because i love my family and friends and i dont want to lose them by going insane i want hope guys please please guys i dont know what to do i want to go to a psychologist aswell but i just want hope rn because i feel like ill never be myself again all this anxiety and all these thoughts are annoying it worries me when i think that this anxiety will never go away i regret smoking weed i never needed that  please guys i want hope ive never felt like this before will anybody help me all i want is hope i wish i never smoked weed and i dont want this anxiety and irrational way of thinking to stay i want to be better please what do i do try to relax breathe be easy on yourself the weed will leave your system and you will be ok i promise if it is the weed causing this it wont stay in your system for ever try to use distractions funny videos things that interest you cute guys or girls documentaries about your hobbies activities with friends that you love take your mind off of it its going to pass if its the weed is it the first time you smoked before are there stressors going on in your life right now things happening that are worrying you or bad things happening to you are you stressed or freaked out about having to leave your sister its going to be ok i promise just try to relax breathe deep and slow keep talking here i will talk to you i think you are going to be ok i have heard of that drug triggering psychosis and i have had innocuous drugs do it to me go see the doctor that is good advice i dont want to go crazy though guys thats my biggest fear and no i havent smoked in a month i guess when i listened to the jay z album i remembered la and remembered the panic attack i had there and i panicked i knew very well i was panicking for no reason so i immediately laid down and calmed myself ever since that which was 3 weeks ago my anxiety goes and comes i get a little anxious in certain lighting i dont know if i have a little bit of ptsd since it was the first panic attack ive had and i was high during it i dont want to go crazy guys thats my biggest fear because if i lose my mind i lose my friends and family and i love them so much theres no reason any of that should happen x but its impossible for us to know whats going on with you medically definitely see a doctor or drugs counsellor as soon as you can i think it would help you to see a doctor to reassure you that you will be ok your anxiety seems to be centered around loosing your mind if you did in fact loose your mind as in psychosis there is successful treatment for that it does not mean you would loose your family and friends hi x and welcome to psych central i agree with the rest of the folks see your doc and tell what happened i dont think youll go crazy but weed doesnt sound like its for you hi xxarauz  i remember back in the day  we used to get some 1hitwonder and go sailing  but sometimes it would be a bad deal  and psychosis would hit  but if i just took it easy it would wear off i have no idea what it is like today  i have had people tell me that todays stuff  is like the very best gold back in the the day it all clears  bad trips  it all clears in a few days just drink plenty of water and fruit juice and u will be a ok i mean it wasntt tystick right  i dont even think you can get that anymore ok what is tystick  weed soaked in opium  that will mess u up ing time  kind of the same as chasing the dragon  not a good idea be safe  i herd about the gummies  i am not sure i would try then or not  even amazon sells then  ok  take care be well keyplayer im sorry you had and are having a tough time its good youre seeing a psychiatrist have you considered a therapist to process some of the things you are and are not feeling i agree that those 2 things might put you back on the path to feeling better sending big hugs i had a similar experience when i used to smoke weed it did some wild things to me i cant smoke it at all sometimes i have a good experience but mostly im paranoid anxious and it lasts for a long time afterward im super sensitive to all things whether its prescription drugs weed harder drugs what have you all i can say is id maybe consider staying away from the weed it might not be worth it if theres a chance it could aggravate what you are experiencing its also true what you said that it couldve triggered something to do with your ptsd anything is possible if it helps though i dont think you are going crazy im still here many years later and i still live anxiety and i have learned how to recognize it and that it doesnt mean im going crazy and if you need help ask for it dont be afraid to do whatever you need to do to keep yourself safe hi s  thanks  yes even with weed sometimes you never know what ur smoken  token  i have not done any illegal drugs for a long  time  and dont plan to start either  take care kp ive gone to the psychologist and she said im not going crazy im gonna do emdr therapy soon too i still worry about my mental health all i want is to feel better i regret smoking weed i hope i can move on thats all i want i know somethings wrong with me and i hope i can move on maybe i need to go back to visit my sister again but without using ing drugs i just want to feel like i did before smoking weed i know i keep saying that but its truly all i want what happened was that i just got too high and had a panic attack i had a memory flashback of the day after my panic attack when we went to disneyland when i listened to jay z im sorry this happened to you and hope it resolves itself its good youre getting help for it best wishes that did scare mei have had fears about choking to death and even developed a swallowing disorder but it is under control now with paxil but still i dont eat hard chewy things do you have that problem the only i can think is for you to go to therapy and talk it out sorry no i dont have a swallowing disorder ive had dreams about choking but it was only once or twice i dont eat hard butterscotch candy anymore i like the chewy ones though especially the ones with green apple in the middle so i started playing guitar for this church group there are other americans here yes but 25 of the people here arepastors other musicians here are from outside of the us they are from kenya now dont get me wrong they are all very nice but that part scares me i dont know if they travel outside the us ofteni am terrified of getting ebola and i heard people who travel outside of the us can get it i hope this doesnt sound messed up but my anxiety is high everytime i have to play at this church and hang around them for free of catching a diseaseebola since they are originally from outside the us is this normal to have anxiety from this caelix3 i have always had social anxiety since childhood very severe had selective mutism in my 20s i had panic attacks and anxiety so bad i got to point i felt like i was going to die around the clock i have been on and off sertraline since then and now in my 40s i have been taking sertraline for 10 years at about 100mg the last 2 years i have been breaking end off so i probably get about 8090mg three months ago i decided i had had enough and wanted to try and go off of them i felt the withdrawal so i stayed at 50mg so for at least two months i have been taking 50mg and have been perfectly fine then last week i started feeling crazy i felt like i had to get out of my skin and was crying and didnt know what to do it started because i was having trouble sleeping because of a sore leg if i was inside the house i felt the need to be outside i couldnt stand the feel of tight pants around my ankles everything bothered me if my nose was blocked i had to get out of bad and keep walking around to clear it i also could not even look at a computer screen or my phone because it drove me crazy and it was too much to take i even had to leave house at 2 am to drive around with my windows open going who knows where i felt like i wanted to die i now know why people kill themselves and why people are addicted to drugs a few days later i asked to have a blood test wasnt sure if it was menopause or what and i found out my iron level was low hemoglobin 102 i have been low before but never felt this crazy low iron can cause anxiety and depression and i am already prone to it so now i know why i felt crazy i felt as if i was having a breakdown randomly crying at work etc i have been trying to take my iron pills now but sometimes forget and i know it is still low is feeling like i do a phobia or anxiety even right now i feel like crying and want to be let out of the house i live with other people right now and feel like i cant be near them i feel they are causing me to feel like this i feel like i always need to be doing something somewhere other than so called home i have been using so much gas on my car because i feel the need to keep getting away i was told by dr to go back up to the 100mg sertraline so i did for a few days i got better now im back to 50mg i am writing this now and i dont feel good i feel like i will not be able to sleep with my leg pain and i feel like i am going stir crazy has anyone experienced this feeling of having to get out of where you are almost like a claustrophobic feeling help is there a reason you dont want to be on 100 mg if it helps you feel better i was on sertraline years ago and withdrew and told myself i would never take again withdrawal is sooo bad i dont want to take it because i feel it makes me make bad decisions and makes me stay in situations i shouldnt be in it makes you take things you should not take i have issues in my life that i just put up with and should not put up with i had a somewhat abusive husband that i stayed with until i withdrew off sertraline years ago my life has been stuck in the same position for ten years i need to move on and the drugs make you just sit there and take it i have also read all about the horror stories of withdrawal and have lived through withdrawal before tonight i took 100mg because of how i am feeling but when my iron level goes back up i will try to withdraw again i stopped for sex drive reasons also the numbness does go away somewhat after years of taking it it also makes you tired and it may be why i eat so much also i am convinced these drugs are poison for your brain yes some people do need it i was a huge huge huge caffeine drinker drinking lots of tea and soda and suddenly one day i couldnt drink it anymore i thought it was so weird i started taking paxil and took one little and i mean one sip of drpepper my heart felt weird but i thought that was weird i took my paxil last night why would caffeine all of sudden give me anxiety suddenly i didnt start paxil until last wednesday and i started having caffeine sensitivity maybe a month ago sorry you are feeling so awful i just wanted to say as i read your post that it reminded me of trying to get off of effexoryou are quite right when you say withdrawal is nasty with these meds i did it correctlywith doctors approval slow withdrawal over time and yet it apparently wasnt slow enough because i was absolutely miserable for example id normally have the radio or tv on in the morning while getting ready for work but suddenly even music was too much being around people set me right on edge couldnt concentrate jittery etc i thought i was going crazy almost everything was just too much stimuli and so i called the psychiatrist and got it adjusted even more slowly it took quite awhile to get off it  and like you i vowed never again but that was years ago and guess what i am on now yup you guessed it  effexor i absolutely dread the withdrawal but it is coming because i am not feeling its doing much for me this time and i am doing okay these days i am not a doctor and as you said you have low iron so maybe it is solely that but you might want to ask your doctor if medication withdrawal could be contributing to any of these symptoms danceengine7 wowi understand i hope you have a better transition this time going from 100 to 50 mg if 50 mg doesnt work for you could you try another medication hugs today i am worrying and getting anxious more so than in a long time no triggers i am immediately aware of just lots happening no one to really talk to went to the docs today but screwed up speaking to him so he probably thinks i am lying now or just being silly should have written down what i wanted to say then i wouldnt forget things and get confused lack of sleep probably not helping scared i cant cope scared i wont cope and i will lose everything why is it coming back i thought i was over it thought i had beat it all the anxiety the depression the self harm but slowly it creeps back in taking up a familiar place in my mind questioning every thought action conversation sorry i needed to put it down try to reverse it get more sleep if you can and remember what helped you in the past i hope it all moves out there is no vacancy in that familiar place in your mind for them yep having a tbi can do that my brother has tbi and he imagines entire scenarios he is in disability and lives with my other brother he asked my mother the other day do you remember last week when i took you with me and bought that red car then i took you riding around in it we explained no mike that didnt happen you cant drive either its just your brain injury he just shrugged and said oh he was ok with it thank god it doesnt seem to bother him when he finds out that he imagined something falldusktrain i suppose a migraine aura would not explain it  you would know if you were having one of those it happens know that no good streak lasts forever but neither does a bad one you dont beat it forever at least not negativity but perhaps perhaps you can learn to simply be at peace with it how do you do that take a step back see the bigger picture and know that it isnt always that bad when youre so anxious and depressed everything seems so bleak these are just thoughts that feed on your negativity when youre feeling positive positive thoughts will occur im saying this to remind myself too i know it isnt always easy sometimes the  just doesnt seem fair i know you try so hard but still and that counts for everybody everybody just tries their very best according to what they know and belief still there is so much suffering in the world it seems so demotivating but theres hope i look at mentors and gurus who seem happy or even blissful they show me that there is still light they show me certain waypoints along the path the path itself they can not show thats for me to figure out but they show a possibility i also look at my own experience certainly ive had moments of happiness or relative happiness but i dont look at that so much its good to remind yourself that this too will change that life moves in cycles but to me that is not vital ive given up on trying to be happy although my behaviour certainly doesnt always reflect that statement no my goal in this life is to become peaceful what is peace that happiness is not peace is ease distance being peaceful you are not so concerned with your highs and lows but you watch it as if you have in fact nothing to do with these highs and lows altogether as if youre not part of it can you remember moments like that you were unhappy but you just didnt really care about it you looked at it but it didnt feel as if it were you those moments i desire so much more than ordinary happiness because i know happiness is so fleeting but peace perhaps one day it would not be fleeting anymore i want to experience that but i want you and everybody to experience that too i dont know if that helps you its a perspective but you dont have to accept it if you dont want you said you had nobody to talk to if you want you can talk with me im trying to be a more openhearted person id like to help im not online here too often nor do i check the inbox here often so if you want just contact me on my phone number 31627544818 not sure if posting phone numbers is against forum rules or not but ill leave it here for now i dont mind dont be shy to contact me id like to be of service for that matter it is okay for anyone reading this to contact me if they want to talk ill try my best to listen more than to put out theories unless you ask of course cepheidvariable hugs koolz09 i can understand this kind of anxiety one time at a business conference a man sneezed directly into my right eye i worried for months the probability of getting ebola is very very low and like another poster said it comes from being in contact with infected body fluids i think you are ok i apologize in advance if this post is too long  but please bear with me  thank you for taking the time to read back in june of this year i seemed to experience some sort of breakdown i was so paralyzed in stress and anxiety that i completely couldnt function at work or home i ended up quitting my job and had to rest at home during this time i also had this feeling that i could lash out at anyone  like my manager but mostly my parents who i live with i felt boiling anger and resentment which ill explain more below to give some context  i am 24 years old and have lived at home since graduating college 2 years ago ive overall had a happy upbringing but did feel a bit directionless and depressed during college some things happened that affected me i felt pretty low and depressed about moving back home upon graduating but didnt know what else to do i ended up taking a job in my hometown which was a good opportunity even though i dont feel like i fit in my town and always wanted to be in the city i dont really have many friends around here in terms of my parents theyre immigrants from europe and have always put some pressure on my sister and me to succeed in life so ive never told them about my struggles with depression  fast forward to june this year i had this breakdown and continue to be at home as i mentioned above i felt an intense feeling of resentment and anger directed mostly towards my parents i felt like i was sick of everyone in my life and tired of pretending i was ok and happy i always felt this pressure to be the good child in my parents eyes i specifically felt resentment towards my mom for the emotional invalidation ive gotten from her over the years to go along with these feelings i felt crippling anxiety and had intense panic attacks and this urge to escape and like i was going to absolutely lose it i kept telling myself just burst out and express your painanger stop holding back from your parents but the anxiety was so bad i couldnt do it no matter how much i tried it felt like i was going to go out of control which scared me  over the following months since then i feel pretty numbed out depressed i guess like i feel very isolated from the world and nothing interests me at all im seeing a psychiatrist so hopefully that will help my concerns looking back on all this is why do i feel numb now and is it because of those intense feelings i sensed how do i get back to feeling like myself and normal and a part of the world sometimes i feel like im on the verge of breaking down emotionally or having a meltdown like theres something deep within me that needs to come out or fall apart  has anyone ever experienced this or what do you make of it dear jenna 61997  im so sorry you are going through this i completely understand when you say you cant express yourself or be your true self with your parents i was never able to eitheri always felt like i needed to pretend to be who they wanted me to beand still do im now 42 i never really speak my mind with my family i dont have a lot of experience in this but what i can tell you from my own experience is that sometime we feel numb because it is easierbetter than feeling so much pain and suffering it is a defense mechanism and its normal youre protecting yourself right now from additional pain so that you can get through this try not to stress over it your body and mind just need a break  anxiety can be exhausting both mentally and physically i slept almost all day for 12 weeks after starting anxiety meds  my anxiety had been so high for so long that i was completely exhausted from it im glad you are seeing a psychiatrist and i hope that you have or will talk to them about how you are feeling ive been doing therapy for 6 months and it has helped a lot as well as some anxiety meds  which have made a huge difference please dont be afraid to open up to your doc and ask for help  it is hard and i had to tell my doc things i had never told anyone before and it was scary but its worth it  they really do want to help you sometimes just being able to tell someone how you feel can give you some relief even if its not your parents who you wish you could tell sometimes our parents dont have the skills to teach us all of the things we need to know once were grownups perhaps theyre emotionally shutdown themselves or dont know how to talk about difficult things maybe no one did that for them but right now you need to take care of yourself and if youre not comfortable talking to them please talk to your doctor thank you so much for taking the time to read my long message and also for providing genuine feedback it really means a lot and puts things in perspective part of me is frustrated that i never expressed my emotions but perhaps in time i will thanks again and i hope you feel better too 3 i dont know if this is mental health or not but i need to see if anyone else experiences this say youre looking at the sidewalk corner of an intersection where you know theres always been a 4way stop you know there should be a stop sign there i mean youve seen everyday when youre coming home but theres no stop sign nor is there any sign there has ever been one still it should be there so you stare at this spot determined to see the pole and the red sign attached but no dice its not there you blink change your line of sight but its still missing then your friend next to you asks whats going on and you look at them to ask where is the stop sign you look back pointing at the location and theres the sign there just like always i wanted to chalk this up to some sort of brain fart but it was so intense this isnt the only time this has happened to me and it happens with almost any object in fact its fairly common its even happened with an entire building once like theres the plot of land but the building has been replaced with a small grass field when i do this its always on one of my bad days which means a laundry list of symptoms from my disorders are at the top of their game so basically when my stress is through the roof can anyone else relate or have any idea what this is ive never experienced this do you thinking your doctor would recognize this pattern i know ill bring it up with him today i just was looking to see if anyone else understood it too i forgot the name for it but apparently its a condition caused by traumatic brain injury which makes sense so i guess this isnt technically a mh condition  i had a massive pa at work and was too bad to stay afterwards now im dreading going back monday i just keep playing scenarios in my head over and over about what is going to be said it was in front of my manager boss and office staff i have been put on valium to help me get through but im so sick to my stomach i have recently been diagnosed with a slew of things the one i struggle with the most is anxiety coupled with ptsd i had some really bad things happen recently and my therapist suggested that if it gets worse to go to the er not because im suicidal im not but because im not fuctioning at all im not on meds yet bc im waiting for my appointment so im curious when you guys think its best to go get help and maybe get started on meds quicker when is your appointment you need the meds sooner rather then later i feel for you i have anxiety and depression and would much rather deal with the depression if it gets too bad and you do go to the hospital i doubt they would put you ip since youre not suicidal theyll probably give you a sedative like valium and maybe a prescription for some more im sorry you are struggling sending big hugs i once was so anxious i found a walk in psyche type clinic same day and told counselor i need something to calm me short term they gave me ativan it worked but i am scared of drugs but only took it on extremely bad days rarely 2 days in a row i am afraid of addiction personally but it helps to know it is there in case things are really bad i forgot how i found it but i would suggest calling any psyche place and ask them if there is any such thing in your town ask for a same day clinic just be honest with them i consistently have higher anxiety on monday and even sunday night it is most likely because i have to work on monday and all the stresses and anticipation hits me i feel like i go through this cycle almost every week my anxiety is high on monday and i spend the rest of the days bringing it down to a level i can more easily cope with is there a way to break this pattern other than quitting my job of course ive been putting off getting a therapist for a long time because i lost my job and cant afford it i decided a few days ago just to go and put it on credit cards for the time being because my anxiety has gotten really bad and i just have no idea what else to do anymore every waking minute feels like pure torture and i have the thought that i want to just die many times per day so anyway i started trying to call up therapists in my insurance network and it seems like no one ever answers their phone i mean it makes sense that they would often be away from their phones if theyre in sessions with clients but how in the heck does anyone ever manage to schedule an appointment with a therapist if they never answer their phones  of course the few that do answer are completely booked for the rest of the year this is stressing me out and making my anxiety even worse i have no friends and no supportive family members to turn to for support either i feel like i have no options and nowhere to go i dont have any advice right off so hopefully others will something tells me you are not alone in this just wanted to show my support and send big hugs i was taking some mucinex so that may of increased my heart rate which is quite possible i paxil mentions serotonin syndrome when you drink caffeine which is quite rare but if i drink a bottle of pop or have one cup of coffee will it hurt me id ask my psychiatrist but knowing my psychiatrist id be shot down since my psychiatrist tells me sugar is bad which i guess i kinda agree on some levels sorry you are having a hard time finding help i have a few ideas that might work have you ever checked out the psychology today website they have a therapist finder section that lists the therapists their credentials treatment orientation etc in each citystate often they have a photo with the listing and they also indicate whether a sliding scale fee is available its very well done in my opinion the other possible option is online therapy via email computer phone etc i was pleasantly surprised at how helpful my experience was check out presto experts website or better counseling and i am sure there are other reputable sites also just thought of this and you may have already tried it but many cities have mental health clinics that offer low cost therapy groups etc the big drawback with this one is they often have a waiting list but if you tell them its rather urgent perhaps they can get you in sooner rather than later good luck i get this too i cant seem to cure the lowlevel dread i feel but if i have a particularly hard sunday i will identify and write down everything about the next dayweek that is worrying me i will try to come up with an action plan for everything im worried about sometimes this is enough to reduce the dread back to manageable levels sometimes its not though im sorry youre having such a tough time i can relate have you called every provider in your network and left a message then followed up i know its frustrating my therapist retired and it was difficult finding another therapist i had to be persistent it was difficult enough to find somebody in network that i considered doctor on demand i hope you find somebody in network soon the above poster has some excellent ideas if you cant sending big hugs so sorry you are having a hard time finding someone it is really hard it took 3 months for me to get in for my first appointment and the day of that appt the doctor was out sick and i had to reschedule for a month later 4 months it took to get in its really tough waiting for so long when you feel like you need help now hope you can find someone i havent been diagnosed for sure as to whether its anxiety or not but assuming it is how do you treat it lemon water with or without a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar ginger root sliced or in capsule cinnamon green tea i drinktake all these on a daily basis i usually have a lot of bloating from ibs and the pill but these methods have kept me fitting in my jeans lol hope i helped ive tried to explain this to many people but all fail to come to a conclusion on why it is i feel the way i do when i have my anxiety attacks so i question whether or not anyone shares this experience or if it is extremely irregular when i have my anxiety attacks which are fairly common id say i have multiple a month they build up for days and days then i finally outburst when i express them outwardly i become completely detached from everything and seems as if i lose all control over my body emotions brain etc but i also simultaneously feel the most control ive ever experienced i feel like i have nothing to worry about in the world it starts with anger i commonly flip my bed over completely slam my fists into my walldoorfloor until they bloody then i break down and cry for a very short period then i have what as i describe as an addiction i look forward to this part of my attacks i have intense hysteria and laugh uncontrollably for a while and i clean up everything i just did tidy everything up then have a hot shower and im completely fine ive never spoken to anyone with anxiety as well so i dont know if this is normal feedback would be appreciated im fairly concerned hello welcome to pc have you been evaluated by a professional you may find it beneficial no i havent im waiting until im legally an adult my parents and i share the fear of going to see a professional about mental health because my little brother was diagnosed with bipolar personality disorder and they had him on lithium and turned him into a zombie im not a dr but that sounds like bipolar disorder rather than anxiety i strongly suggest you see a dr and start your healing process xx ive become increasingly isolated over the years and i barely talk to people anymore i live with my mother and my cousin but we dont have a good relationship so i dont talk to them much either yesterday an acquaintance that i hadnt spoken with in a few months texted me so i started getting anxious and overthinking things to a ridiculous extreme like i cant think of a thing to say i dont have anything interesting to say i dont want to say something weird or dumb or annoying she knows vaguely of some of my issues so she probably pities me i doubt shes texting me because she likes me as a person im not likeable im not even a very nice person and then it always takes me way too long to respond a text and this is just with texting or talking online in person i can barely look at someones face i feel lonely most of the time and i wish i had someone to talk to but when the opportunity presents i just wanna go hide somewhere ive been meaning to go to a therapist ive searched in my area and ive found one that i want to go see but i havent called yet i dont even know what to say tbh like what is someone even supposed to say in this situation in the meantime if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this type of issue id appreciate it yes call the therapist so you can start getting the help and support you need for your social anxiety also dont beat yourself up you are being too harsh with yourself kindness will get you much further and youll feel better i empathize i have social anxiety and isolate as well good luck sending big hugs one sip seems like such a small amount that is weird if you stopped caffeine for a long period of time and then started back you could feel the effects more strongly because your body is not used to it anymore also i know certain medicines can intensify it and some overthecounter drugs contain it such as headache cold and allergy medicines i have sensitivity to caffeine but can drink a small amount if i have too much i get jittery and restless ive started experiencing intense anxiety with a woman in work she is nice but can be intimidating and has been quite harsh with me before which i think has made me feel anxious around her at the end of the day in work we have to read out a handover of the days events and with everyone else its fine but with her when i start reading i go red and my voice trembles and i just cant do it ive started saying im sorry im so tired i cant read this which is a terrible excuse and will not keep working i will be doing a handover with her in a few days and im already dreading it almost going as far as to think i will need to get off work early to avoid it the whole thing takes less than 5 minutes and when i talk to her im absolutely fine its just reading out this handover i dont know what to do it feels impossible to overcome right now definitly see a therapist some people might not get good ones but mine is really nice and sweet most therapists are actually really good once u get 2 know them good maybe you try to talk to her about this issue in private i had a boss who intimidated me and could get quite harsh when i screwed up i actually brought it up to him in a performance review so we were alone i ended up crying and felt really embarrassed but i got it out in the open he was understanding about it and after that he didnt criticize me in front of others he still got on me when i screwed up but he did it in private i was grateful for that and appreciated the tips on how to improve my performance this is the reason well and my bp that i cannot work because of my ptsd i have an intense fear of women and if theyre of authority even worse ive gotten panic attacks at every job because of this sometimes id spend 30 min in the bathroom having a panic attack or id just be told to go home one asshole boss said dont come back until you get on xanax those exact words and he meant it i totally get how you feel but does it maybe come from a deeper issue i had a step monster that ruined my life growing up and now i cant trust or feel comfortable around women i agree with shazerac if you can talk to her privately do so sending big hugs this happened to my friends aunt we didnt think anything of it really she got checked out medically and they didnt find anything just think if it happened to someone else would you think much about it probably not people think about themselves mostly not so much about other people im sorry this happened to you i agree with travelinglady act as if nothing happened you may be uncomfortable at first but it will pass sending big hugs hugs oh that must be scary i wouldnt bring up unless they ask if they do just tell them youve gone to the doctor and are looking into it im so afraid how did you do today gadnic great im so glad they were so understanding its not easy to deal with i want through the same thing however my supervisor wasnt as understanding i caught a bunch of stuff over it so much for a understandind bunch of coworkers i no longer work there that is good news glad to hear it i know just what you mean last week i picked up a prescription which cost me equivalent of 2wks groceries i have always gotten my medication free because of my benefits so this was a big shock everyone says i should have refused it but i am not the type for confrontation so i reluctantly paid for it now i am kicking myself for taking it i am sure my doctor could have represcribed some alternative yzen hello im not sure if anyones ever experienced this but for some time now ive been experiencing hyperawareness of life particularly in the emotional sense of things relations with other people and the fluidity of life its hard to explain but for example if im in a fight with someone in my head i become aware of each moment and feeling in the process like i anticipate what is going to happen next or what im going to be feeling next emotionally this doesnt allow me to experience my feelingsthe moment smoothly because its like this hijacking mechanism that tells me oh youre going to be feeling this next its like overanalyzing my and others progression of feelings does anyone know what im talking about this may be coming from feeling extremely jaded ive been depressed for a long time now and i really feel hopeless and at the end of my rope like nothing is going to help its really hard for me to get my emotions and pain out  i almost feel crazy and like im making this all up because of how empty i feel i dont remember what normal life feels like hello welcome to pc ive never experienced this but i hear what youre saying personally i tend towards hypervigilance in many social situations which is always thinking ahead and being extremely wary of what might go wrong next and trying to think of various outcomes and responses before they happen so i overanalyze things and people this sounds like it might be similar yes its very tiring and unhelpful i doubt youre jaded or just making it up it sounds like you might not only be anxious but anxious about being anxious and your mind is racing ahead in a futile effort to cut it off  by worrying about it all maybe you relate to that this is supposedly common for people with certain forms of anxiety you say youve been depressed for some time now im sorry to hear youre struggling so much have you sought out any help yet maybe someone else here can share some more relevant experiences welcome to pc and take care i am currently have anxiety about getting anxiety i fear that by becoming anxious i will ruin a special moment the combination of mucinex and caffeine makes me jittery if you get enough magnesium and potassium that can help if you are having heart palpitations i used to drink a lot of caffeine and it never bothered me until i switched to water for awhile once i went back to caffeinemajor anxiety i strictly limit caffeine now i would just keep an eye on it and be cognizant of what causes what hi cepheidvariable this sounds very accurate actually something a previous counsellor mentioned to me having anxiety about anxiety it sometimes feels like an uncontrollable pattern but im glad someone else can relate thank you for your help and advice i actually sometimes get anxiety when i do not have enough caffeine i probably drink too many coffees so it is pretty wierd hope u feel better i recently paid what i think was too much for a repair at the time i had to get the repair done and i didnt want to wait to find someone else i dont know if what i paid was normal for the job but i continue to feel anxiety and regret around the loss of money even a week after i paid i probably should have waited and found someone that did charge so much putting it behind me is difficult i cant do anything about it now so i am not sure why i still have anxiety around it im new to this support site i remember being part of one when i was pregnant with my daughter and it really seemed to help mostly because i was the one offering my help and doing what i could to help other new moms today i find myself in a group and its because i need help i have struggled with obsessive thoughts and anxiety since i was 10 years old now im 36 and my world seems to be spiraling out of control i quit my job and moved to a new city with my daughter and boyfriend my boyfriend started a new business that i am helping him to grow starting a new business is scary my daughter was diagnosed with autism about 8 years ago and i work with other children who have been diagnosed with autism my life really seems great on paper but in my mind im destined to fail and i cant seem to do anything right i get chest pains nightly and i cry for no reason i cant sleep and i fidget constantly lately i fight with my boyfriend all of the time mostly because he moves things out of their designated place in the house ive begun to obsess over where things are placed and if theyre not then it sets me off on my own i decided to go to the doctor yesterday it didnt take them long to suggest a medication to go on and after 15 hours and some questionnaires later i was released back into the wild this is what brings me here today i have a prescription sitting in my nightstand and i am terrified to take it it promises me a world i havent known since i was a small child but i am so scared it will change me i dont know what to do im here because i hope somebody can help me work through this or share their experience taking a prescription for the first time causes a new wave of fear in me im lost and i feel more broken than i ever have felt hello first of all welcome to pc i was scared of medication changing me too im not going to tell you to just jump in and everything will be roses but i will tell you my experience you probably know this already but everyone responds differently to different medications so dont expect any one outcome based on what others say still there are some things that are more common than others is your prescription an antidepressant i started with one a few years ago and it had some unpleasant but manageable side effects still it didnt do a whole lot for me and i stopped after a few months i started up a second round with a different type two years later and it seems to be the right one for me im on my fourth month of this new med has it changed me a little but not in a bad way i dont think im not an emotional zombie which was a fear of mine has it given me my life back as some claim these medications do yes and no i can tell you that i am not magically cured and i am not out of the woods with depression and anxiety butthese things have lessened noticeably and when i do have good days they are usually better than ive known in a long time so for the time being i am glad i took the plunge im glad i came back and tried again after the first round didnt do anything for me take this experience with a grain of salt as you wrestle with your decision though i just wanted to offer one perspective there are others on here who might give more caution than me and others still who will be much more insistent on you taking them now this instant sorry for the wall of text i wish you luck in managing your anxiety hello welcome to pc im sorry youre struggling with whether or not you should take the medication it could really help you just wanted to lend my support and wish you a smooth transition if you decide to go with taking it sending big hugs to give you a brief history i had a stroke about six months ago and although im recovering have all of my mental faculties and speech hasnt been affected i still have weakness in my left leg which causes me to limp which im going to physical therapy for and it seems to be getting a little better slowly im counting my blessings that my stroke wasnt worse about 2 months ago i would start getting these anxiety atacks that came out of nowhere what i mean i wasnt thinking about anything specific or worried about anything specific it affects me physically as sometimes i cantt sleep when im having one of these episodes ive been doing some guided meditations and exercising which seems to help a little what ive been reading is that trying to push away the anxiety can make it worse and that i should just accept it its a really hard thing to do as i know how  i will feel after one of these anxiety attacks its like trying to not be anxious when you know you are getting sick because you know how bad you will fee anyone have any experience with this i get anxiety when im having physical problems having a stroke is a pretty major event in your life its a lot to cope with and the fear that it might happen again this could be what is causing your anxiety maybe you could try indentifying the source of your anxiety in meditation just a thought i struggle with a lot of freefloating anxiety not related to anything in particular i always have im almost 70 years old now and after so many years i think my body just simply doesnt know how to act any other way and as i get older it seems like my anxiety is getting gradually worse i also experience periodic bouts of paranoia i have done sitting meditation in the past but ive never found it to be particularly beneficial although i still do a bit of it i do a mindfulnessbased exercise routine that is a combination of yoga some physical therapy exercises i learned to strengthen my low back  some plain old calisthenics i also do some walking meditation particularly late at night when i cant sleep ill walk aroundaround our dark  quiet home focusing light attention on each foot as it touches the floor thoughts come  go i simply watch them  allow them to arise  fade at their own pace none of this is a cure by any means but it all helps two books that have been particularly beneficial to me have been jon kabatzinns book full catastrophe living and pema chdrns book start where you are a guide to compassionate living best wishes im sorry youre experiencing this im glad you came through the stroke okay can you ask your doctor if this free floating anxiety is a result of the stroke and if he has anything he can suggest sending big hugs  hi yzen  man  i hate it when that happens  i hear you i own a 14  a 12 year old honda civic ex  dead mint  with less than 60k  plus a 35 year old mobile home  i mean geez  i am always getting taken to the cleaners  i feel for yeh  really but the best thing to do  is try to but it behind you  sure it hard  real hard there have been times i would go food shopping and think did i over pay   i would stop on the side of the road and check my wallet to make sure  i could not even wait to get home so i know where you are coming from  it sux  but everything cost so much  i mean geez heres what i would do  grab a snack and chat  get your mind off of it  you really cant do anything about it anyway i hope u feel better and u r not alone  me  i am real clean  lol later kp thanks keyplayer that is good advice to get my mind off it and move on and stay clean lol i tend to let regrets and losses trigger my anxiety i have to remind myself that nothing really belongs to anyone forever and we can only move forward why let what i lost in the past bother me now i need to let go of it im sorry this happened to you and that you are feeling anxiety about it you cant go back and change it now but youve gained valuable knowledge for the future try to focus on moving forward and not spending time or energy on what you cant change sending big hugs i have felt i had made huge progress in overcoming my anxiety mainly social anxiety i went through therapy take anti depressantsanti anxiety medication and today it was put to the test and i failed miserably i was invited to a support group for abuse survivors and i felt lost and sick almost the entire 2 hours i didnt speak a word and i felt that i was about to burst into tears for the whole session i felt so prepared and ready for it that it shocked me at how horrible i felt throughout i just do not know how i can improve and feel okay socializing my goal was to go to college this year and after tonight i feel so horribly defeated and hopeless i feel i just wont be able to do this anymore i dont know what to do anymore i dont know what to say only that i am sorry and that i understand how you feel unfortunately remember how brave you were hoping this was just a minor set back in the process and you keep doing better the progress youve made hasnt been lost  its still there you went to the group  big step in itself yes it was rough but wow pat yourself on the back for going and a group for survivors is already going to be rough emotionally and not surprising it knocked you over can you try something else and see how you go with that something without so many emotional tanglements today i went to the movies with my parents to watch jumanji i have already posted here about how my parents are overprotective and make me wear a crazy amount of winter clothes so i was wearing my giant parka with a winter coat under it and my snow pants and big winter boots when we got to the movies i took my coats off but kept my snow pants and boots on while waiting to go into the theater some kid goes to his mom why is she wearing snow pants shes not skiing when he said that literally like 15 people all turned and looked at me i could feel myself getting so red from the embarrassment then after the movie while we were still in the theater lobby my mom helped me get my coats back on in full view of everyone then just like i was a little kid she pulled the hoods up and wrapped me up in my scarf i could feel all the people staring at me probably wondering why i was wearing so much winter clothes this is why i just wanna stay home and not go out in public xoannie4 nah they were probably jealous that you were so warm and chose smarter clothing than them lol did you like the movie for a few months ive really struggled partially i think its been related to a visit to the dentist half a year ago which revealed quite suddenly that i have many problems and not nearly enough funds to solve them so ive been saving since then and trying to recover mentally and today i had enough courage for a consultation now im afraid that it was too soon because of the effect the interaction with the people has had on me although maybe there is no good time from the inability to formulate responses to speak clearly to sweating all the time not being able to follow what the other person is saying then fighting with myself about it on the way home plus the fear of pain and them clearly knowing that im feeling it whats worse i cant in good conscience treat myself to a sweet as a rewardcomfort i just hate myself not in life not in the disease what i have goes beyond labels i am writing here this time because i feel i need to share and i feel i need to hide i am embarassed of myself of my fear of my behaviours and my decisions if i ever had a true friend in my life i would turn their lifes in to a mess because that is what i am i can putt anyone off i push people away from me as i am i could write anywhere else but i feel embarassed about what people who had see my posts and already know a bit of my story will think i feel embarassed of who i am i can read criticism and disaproval in peoples words and faces all the time i cant trust anyone its beyond me and i feel alone people think i dont like them and that i am weird but if i explained this to them they would find me even more weird and i wouldnt be able to look at them again in shame there was this person that wanted to hang out with me just the two but i have to complicate every thing in my mind i wanted and i didnt because is always awful i made up a lot of scenarios in my mind for such a small simple thing because of my vague and sparse answears online messages he deduced i didnt want to go out that probably i was trying to avoid him whatever nothing is going to happen now and it makes me feel safe but at the same time i made such a fool of myself he is a nice person not threatening but even so i was stressed so he must think i dont like him as a person or that i am very weird or both and i am mad at me you have my sympathies i hate going to the dentist or doctor especially as i struggle to explain myself clearly and worry about being misunderstood whenever i go i try to proud of myself reminding myself that by taking care of myself or at least trying to that im doing a really good thing i know youre scared but you should stick with going back for another consultationtreatment you may have enough money to have some of your problems fixed there are online support forums for people with dental phobia they offer good advice to each other on what to expect and offer tips on how to cope maybe it would be useful to you please take care and good luck let us know how you get on also be proud of yourself for finding the courage to go back oh i forgot about this thread well since last time i got a root canal done and a filling at that time but also a filling just yesterday that sounds kind of crappy well hopefully my new sugarfree diet improves the situation i mean the situation is supposed to deteriorate with age but hopefully at a slower rate social anxiety doesnt particularly haunt me at that clinic well the last visit was kind of awkward but i dont let myself dwell on it nowadays by almost always listening to things on the headphones outside in particular hi mulan i can see you posted this months ago but just wanted to say i can relate to every word as if i was the one saying them thank you theres a certain comfort in knowing im not alone but as you know you still have to face each day andthe people oh dear i blew it with my last real life friend as well  its been a real learning curve a very very long learning curve thats still curving up and up and around  i cant see the end of it im not the full quid just feeling really empty today disillusioned but i know the hope will return once my emotions settle a bit more just want you to know youre not alone as well over the years ive become really compulsive about my teeth i go to the dentist every six months to have them cleaned  checked as a result theyre in pretty good shape now although i had a lot of problems many years ago as a young adult since my parents didnt take care of my teeth growing up but i still always dread going to the dentist i start ruminating over it about a week before every appointment im glad to hear youre getting your dental problems taken care of\n",
