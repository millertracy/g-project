      "doc: im sorry youre dealing with this i dont know if youre going through something stressful in life right now but often our body responds in odd ways to stress when you start feeling the dread try breathing deeply listening to soothing music and drinking water it seems simple but it really helps thanks for sharing its nice being a part of a support group and knowing that youre not alone anxiety is a difficult beast many days you can feel fine and then other days its overwhelming keep pressing on keeping reaching out thanks for being so brave and sharing youre not alone many people deal with the fear of associating with others i dealt with social anxiety for years someone told me that whenever im in a crowd to remember that most people are worried that when they meet new people they will be rejected think of everyone as scared and you dont feel so alone people are always going to try and push you to fit into a mold that they believe is best if you feel happy and confident in your life direction then hold your ground you dont need to fight simply stand yes you will face adversity but it seems to me that youre set in your goals im sorry that youre going through all of this thank you for being so brave and sharing i grew up in a home where my parents fought like crazy finally my mom and dad got divorced it took me a really long time to realize that it was not my responsibility to fix my parents marriage i know you want to help but the best thing you can do is speak to a counselor about your feelings in all of this i dont know why your mom is staying in the marriage if she is so unhappy but you cant carry the burden for everyone give yourself some rest you deserve it keep hope thanks for sharing this time of year cause anxiety and depression for many folks youre not alone the overcommericalized rush that our society has created has really taken away from the peace and joy this season is supposed to be about in the past i got overwhelmed trying to create that feeling when i realized that instead of focusing on what i dont have or dont like about the season focusing on the good really helps try volunteering at a childrens hospital or maybe at a homeless shelter giving not material possessions really takes you out of the rush and puts what youre blessed with in perspective what youre describing is not so uncommon many of us deal with weird anxieties regarding how other people view us the important thing to remember is that your happiness cannot be in another persons head overthinking about what other people are thinking about will drive you insane i know i did it for years finally i decided one day to not let other peoples expectations hinder me i hope you find the same freedom\n",

      "doc: hello and   i agree with bee  youre struggling with something thats one of the most stressful and distressing things people can go through  dont beat yourself up for suffering  please be kind to yourself right now  gad will obviously make things harder for you because the anxiety and dejection that comes from a break up is enough to knock most relatively stable people on their arse  youre not weak you have within you the strength to cut ties find that sense of closure you need and move on  you owe it to yourself and itll only take you properly realising that to turn the corner  i hope you can find that sense of closure soon    do whatever you need to do to get it as well  if you need to talk to your ex and say whats on your mind before you can let go then do that  equally if you need to cut himher out of your life and even people associated with himher do that  do whats best for you  it should all be about you right now oh god thats raw  things will get better form here promise never listen to acquaintances about this kind of thing  they are by their very definition people who dont know you very well  who cares what they think really  you were engaged and it hasnt even been a month  you have every right to be in pieces right now  youre not weak this is just understandably very painful for you right now but youll see your strength again once you move further and further on from this  processing your pain doesnt make you weak im so sorry youre having to face all of this shit from people who dont know what the bloody hell theyre talking about  people are very quick to judge depression but anyone whos actually suffered from it would never treat anyone like that  please remember its not your fault that you cant work and that youre doing a lot of good in your community by being there for other people  im currently working and im glad my tax money is spent supporting the people who really need it hello and welcome to the forum  im so sorry your neighbours are making you feel like this  no wonder youre sick with anxiety  is there any way you could get out of the situation    have you told the council or the police about what theyve been doing  the best advice ive ever heard about stuff like this is document everything  keep a journal video them make a video diary record the noise on your phone take pictures   that way if you have to prove what theyve done at a moments notice you can  also have you been in touch with your gp  they might be able to help you in the short term in terms of eating and sleeping while you sort yourself an escape plan  really hope you can get out of this awful situation soon and that your anxiety can be lessened ps   is there anywhere you can go during the day just to get away from them there are antidepressants you can take that have an antianxiety effect too  im on fluoxetine and i cant remember which kicks in first the antidepressant element or the antianxiety element but that might be something to consider with your gp  id go in and ask for some valium too dont know if they prescribe that but still maybe talk to the police  its antisocial behaviour   im so outraged for you that youre having to put up with this situation aww im so sorry  maybe some counselling alongside this will help  hope you can feel some relief soon ive found something that helps me is having an alarm clock with a light on it which increases in intensity in the time building up to your set alarm time the idea is that it mimics the rising of the sun and gives you a more natural waking up    heres an example sunlight  they can be quite expensive but theyre worth it in the long run hello and    just tell the doctors what youve told us you might even want to print out what youve written here if you struggle to get it out into words  that way the doctor will know how youre feeling and how much youre struggling and hopefully theyll be able to give you the treatment you need right now   wish you all the best  university can be a very difficult time   i think going to the uni counsellor is a very good idea  theyre easy to access and you dont get that at any other time in your life im so sorry to hear youre struggling with this  i hate feeling that anxious  its like torture     im glad your boyfriends so supportive  hes right  the job isnt worth making yourself absolutely sick and miserable for  youll find the rent in some other way   clearly freelance work is too distressing and detrimental to your health at the moment  dont feel guilty about that im so sorry youre struggling like this and im really glad youre finding some help for your issues   im going to speak frankly in the hope that i wont upset you and if i do make you feel bad im genuinely sorry  im saying this from the perspective of someone whos also dealt with serious anger issues and has hurt others in the past  i know  from experience that the sooner you take responsibility for it the quicker you can both heal  with that said  your reaction to her not having sex with you could be having untold damage especially if she is bipolar  if someone had that reaction to me not having sex with them i probably wouldnt ever have sex with them again id feel as though i was having sex with them under threat  its really good that shes understanding about this  but you seriously need to sort that out you cant pressure a woman into having sex with you that way  its really damaging  i know you dont mean to hurt her because your reaction is the result of feelings of rejection that are too much for you to handle right now and your reaction does not make you a bad person  but you need to think about what this is doing to her  also not allowing her to have friends constitutes abuse  again this doesnt make you a bad person  id suggest taking a break from the relationship so that you can focus on your anger issues and start again by relaying the foundations of a relationship and building trust again with her slowly  unfortunately your anger is meaning that youre breaking a few unspoken rules of relationships because youre not on a solid foundation of selflove and selfawareness  these unspoken rules basically dictate that you must treat the other person with respect if you follow that feeling youll find yourself not treating your wife in the ways you describe  your judgement about this has been skewed by your anger issues but you need to find this sense of clarity before you can rebuild your relationship with your wife and i do sincerely think it needs rebuilding from what youve said  a break might not be necessary though  i hope you can get over these issues fast because you do love each other and everyone makes mistakes  were all struggling and please dont ever feel that you are in any way a bad person youre just dealing with too much right now and you need to take time to heal     you should go and see your gp immediately  i dont know what combination of therapy will work for you but i would suggest going down the route of medication and talking therapy that seems to be a good combination for most people  id definitely look into anger management asap  i hope everything goes really really well for you and i sincerely hope i havent made you feel like shit  youre doing the right thing everythings looking up from here hello and   im so sorry youre experiencing this  it sounds very distressing  ive been through a period of having agonising panic attacks daily so i really feel for you  my suggestion would be to see a gp about your mental health rather than physical health  i think perhaps focusing on the physical side of it might make you more scared that theres something physically wrong with you whereas if you get counselling for example you might be able to cope with your panic attacks better and that might lessen the effect or the occurrences of these attacks  for dealing with the attacks when they happen what i found helped was to not panic  i know that sounds impossible but what i mean is that when your bodys panicking try to remain calm and be aware that this is only a panic attack  tell yourself that and be firm about it  if your thoughts start to wander and you think youre experiencing something physically catastrophic just remember what the doctors said to you  physically youre fine    i know it doesnt make sense at the time cause it feels like youre dying but you can get to a stage where you can keep calm while your body is in panic mode  it takes practice but eventually youll come up with an action plan as to what to do when youre experiencing this  youll get better and better at it until it becomes second nature  remember as well that it will pass    your action plan might be different to other peoples  just find what works for you  keep breathing rhythmically as deeply and for as long as you can  even if it hurts  that will help  consistent breathing is really good because its freeing  try not to move around too much because that might throw your thoughts off balance and make you panic more  you might want to sit forward or lie down  i chose to lie down because theyd last for so long and id end up getting tired  so find a comfortable position perhaps put some music on  you could maybe make an emergency playlist on your phone and id suggest soothing classical music  you might choose to breathe into a bag although i know that doesnt work for me  i become concerned that im only breathing in carbon dioxide which brings about fears of physical catastrophe  that might not be the same for you  but try to avoid anything that feels wrong or knocks your thoughts off balance  you could perhaps light some incense regularly at a time when youre feeling calm perhaps when meditating  get used to the smell of this incense and use it for meditation a good few times and use the same one when youre having a panic attack  your sense of smell is really good for associating with memories and emotions so this might help put you in a calmer mode  and meditating regularly might help ease some of the inner panic youre feeling which might be leading to these panic attacks  check out the headspace app for this  also id suggest white sage incense  hope this eases for you soon really basic but i find this really effective breathe in for two seconds breathe out for 7 repeat  makes you feel a bit lightheaded but its quick and easy works for me sometimes the unknown can make us feel like that  it might just be that you havent started your job yet  i think exercise is a good idea i hope this goes well for you  do you do anything to take your mind off things  maybe reading would be good should be fine i think  if youre worried about this kind of stuff you can store your files on dropbox or something i get that feeling if ive been off work for a little bit  youll be okay i would suggest trying to acclimatising yourself to being around people a little bit each day so it doesnt strike you as too alien and it doesnt stop you from going seeing your friends  going seeing your friends would be really good for you youll get through this  youve made so many positive steps recently  i know its hard to come across a set back but your attitude is so so good right now im sure youll be able to overcome this  just dont let it get too long between trips out and you should be able to beat this im glad youre seeing a specialist about this because itll dispel any fears you may have about it being a physical thing  i think youll feel a hell of a lot better once youre sure what this is and you have some more strategies to deal with it when it happens  its understandable that youd be scared about it because its like a problem you feel youve already solved  but dont worry   i suffer from panic attacks too and i find they come and go  i used to get them almost daily in uni then none at all then a little bit when i was training to be a teacher and then the other morning i woke up having a panic attack and i was like really  im quite good at dealing with them when they happen because they used to happen so so much just dont give into it  dont panic  as hard as that is to do and as easy as it is to say  it hurts like fuck but dont panic and keep breathing and youll find that you can handle them fairly quickly  hope everything goes well for you  in the meantime between now and your appointment is there anyone close to you you could talk to about how anxious youre feeling  that might help i dont think theres any weight to this argument  its like saying love isnt real because its just chemicals in your brain  of course its just chemicals  it doesnt make it feel any less real though  theres no such thing as a selfless act but of course there isnt  doesnt stop you from feeling that you care hello and    im sorry youre struggling with this phobia   in answer to your question im not sure to be honest  im not sure if something like mindfulness would help because that encourages you to be in the now   what about being in the now scares you  is it like an existential crisis im sorry youre going through this  workplace sexual harassment works both ways  youre not there to be gawked at and these women should respect that  im sorry this is making your working life harder than it needs to be hello and    i suggest have him come to a meeting with your gp or therapist so he can hear from them how serious what youre experiencing is  might work if he hears it from someone whos a professional  sometimes people struggle to understand whats going on beneath the surface   might be good for him to see those questionnaires they make you fill out to gauge how depressed you feel eg how often in the past week have you felt worthless etc     hope you find this forum useful and supportive  i know its difficult when your partner doesnt really see what youre going through but hopefully with a bit of education on the subject he can learn to support you in the ways that you need right now i think you need to start thinking about whether this person is the right person for you  if youre talking about your innermost feelings and the pain youre feeling and he had no interest  thats bloody awful i think youre right actually michael  my last post was going a bit far and probably not quite fair to the guy  maybe hes processing it in another way  i sometimes forget how different men are  my apologies  caught me at a bad time i guess i know that feeling  its horrible  its like youre scared of upsetting anyone and you overthink absolutely everything you say   you cant live like that  my advice would be to try to act as authentically as possible with the understanding that youre not going to please everyone and nor should you be expected to because youd never find what you want  do whats right for you and dont feel too bad about not pleasing everyone  thats what im working on  its a long hard process but its so so worth it yeah it really is harder said than done  i dont know how to achieve it really  i think its different for everyone  please dont focus on the negatives about yourself though  im sure there are lots and lots and lots of positives some people just dont know what its like to have mental health issues but those people are often toxic to us  so its not a huge loss  youll find people wholl understand where youre coming from  please dont worry  i know that mustve been quite a saddening experience for you  try to distract yourself by doing something you enjoy its understandable that youd be a debbie downer youre struggling  some people cant really cope with a lot of this stuff  this forum is really good though  im sure your mother isnt exhausted with you  shell just be unsure what to do to help  the best thing you could do right now would be to focus on yourself and try to make yourself feel better i think writing things down is a great idea  its hard to try to summarise all your personal feelings to someone who doesnt know you  maybe your therapist having that background information will mean she will be able to ask more questions that are relevant to you and bring you out of your shell a bit more  dont worry i imagine this is very common in therapy  i think you should also ask yourself if theres anything about your therapist thats making you feel less open sometimes that just happens and it wouldnt be a bad thing if you had to change therapists i have social anxiety too although im coping with it a lot better nowadays and ive had this urge so many times  i think youve got your head screwed on about this though when you say it probably wont solve all of your problems it just seems that way at the time  sometimes you just need a break from your world and thats even harder to do when youre socially anxious maybe what youre feeling is a build up of missed opportunities to breathe away from your normal situation  why dont you go for a hike or something with someone you trust  might make you feel better   wish you all the best hello and welcome to the forum  please dont worry youre just in a transition stage between drugs and that can make you feel temporarily worse  this will pass  im on fluoxetine and it made me worse at the beginning but its really good for me now actually  it just lessens all the really intense feelings of sadness and lets you focus more on things  its quite mellow and comforting  this will pass just keep in close contact with your gppsychiatrist so they can monitor any new developments and decide on the best course of treatment for you  there are better times ahead hello and   i havent had therapy specifically for panic attacks but i used to suffer with them really badly i still do suffer from them still from time to time and ive found that therapy does really help generally  its good to have strategies to know how to deal with it when it happens which lessens your anxiety about it in itself  hope you find something that helps you i know panic attacks are a fucking nightmare but you can get better hello dan and    im so sorry youre struggling with anxiety at the moment  please remember that  although there are a lot of horror stories out there  the appointment should be a good thing for you  i know anxiety can make things seem like everythings doom and gloom and i know its easier said than done but maybe you could try to look forward to it  not to the appointment itself as it sounds like thats a real stressor for you but instead look forward to the feeling of accomplishment and hopefully calm after the appointment if it goes well and makes you feel a bit more in control     i know thats hard to do and i really hope the appointment goes well for you  ive found that if you tell the people there that youre a bit nervous theyre usually quite accommodating for that and will make you feel a bit more at ease  remember its their job to do that   remember youll be feeling a bit nervous about it too because youve been out of the cycle of going outside and things and it can be really hard to get back into all of that but its all in your head   i hope you can find a lovely perfume to wear  just to put your mind at rest  and maybe a hat if itll make you feel better  not that you have to  just might give you a bit of a boost that might make the whole experience a bit more smooth for you   hope it all goes well and thank you for joining the forum  i hope you find it useful  it can be really hard when youre dealing with the anxieties of getting mental health treatment on your own  a lot of conversations here are centred around anxiety in terms of going to appointments so i hope you can share with us how youre feeling as it might show you that youre really not alone when it comes to all of this  also you should never ever suffer in silence aw thats great  my mums like that too  shes like so you owe someone money  what are they gonna do come round here and break your legs  i think not  well just not answer the door  well not answer the fucking door  they can fuck off  hahaha  shes not chavy or anything  im making her sound chavy  shes really sweet and just really on my side   well done for going through that bloody assessment  its done now you should feel so proud of yourself for going and putting yourself through it and by the sounds of it theyll be able to visibly see how much you are suffering which is surely a good thing i love a good swear hey guys  my chest has been in really bad pain all day  its like a constant panic attack but im able to remain calm  but it doesnt take the pain away  its fucking nearly unbearable  i do not know what to do  i know i cant go into work tomorrow  im gonna get a sick note tomorrow  maybe thatll lessen my anxiety  i feel like im broken  every noise is literally painful  trying to breathe  god i dont want to feel like this anymore shit man i wish i had some valium its like a tightening in my chest that is really painful and makes me feel dizzy  im noticing im forgetting to breathe  i had a nap before today and i woke up feeling worse  i will go to bed soon though  thank you im not sure what it is but its just really painful and so long lasting hello and    im so sorry youre experiencing this it must be very difficult to be afraid to sleep  i hope you are getting enough sleep   are you in touch with a gp about this  also you mention you have exams maybe you could talk to the counsellor at your place of study   you might want to consider measures to make yourself feel safer when you go to sleep  maybe look into dreamcatchers  i mean this is the very reason they were created in the first place to protect people from harmful spirits in dreams and certainly its stood the test of time maybe theres something in that you know aw im not sure what this is referring to but it sounds like its really stressful for you and i sincerely hope the torture is over soon  its appalling how these organisations can keep you waiting for far longer than you ever should    wednesday isnt that far away now in the grand scheme of things  try to be kind to yourself in the meantime i dont think you should ring the police  i think you need to take a step back breathe for a while then call a mental health professional  i think youre really struggling right now thats good  maybe you could call someone today while youre feeling so anxious about this theres also stuff on the internet about how the worlds economy is ran by lizard people  and lots of urban legends  doesnt mean its true  im sure if it were true wed know a lot more about it   it sounds like maybe youre having night terrors and are harming yourself in your sleep as a result i dont think theres much in the way of evidence to support this  i dont think youre in any immediate danger  i do think you should get in touch with a mh professional asap if you can  im not sure where to direct you to so i feel a bit useless in this area but maybe nhs direct is a good place to start  they might be able to put you in touch with someone you could speak to in your area this page might be of some use to you  hope you can get some help soon  please dont suffer in silence and try to distract yourself as much as possible hello and    im not sure what to suggest really  i think the best thing is to always keep in touch with your gp and see what they suggest  id also suggest having a change in routine every so often to give your mind a break if you can  also have you tried practising mindfulness  that can sometimes help a lot   hope you find this forum useful and supportive maybe speak to someone else about it who might put in some more direct effective help  you need to take in fluids  could you maybe use a straw  please drink something soon if art therapys helping you maybe continue with that and then get on the waiting list straight away  in the meantime is there any way you could speak to another gp about your fear  maybe nhs direct glad youre giving them a call im so sorry youre going through this right now  i recently went through a break up and i know what you mean  its so intensely painful and can make you feel so bad about yourself but please remember that it wont be like this forever i know emotionally you probably cant look into the future right now though  youre making such a positive step to see your psychiatrist  please be really really kind to yourself right now and focus on you  now is a brilliant time to do that  you can find yourself again you know   wish you all the best i really do ive talked about this in a describe how you feel in a sentence thread but i dont want to hijack it so i thought id make my own  this is what ive already said  having a really bad day im in work tomorrow i havent gotten everything finished and ive had a run in with my ex whos made me feel like shit again really dont need this right now i dont know if work will be understanding about the work i havent done because i made out like the easter holidays would be a cutoff point where i could make my life better but ive been so depressed and stressed out ive barely done anything dont know if i can handle my nqt year  im having really bad anxiety   thanks everyone for your support and letting me vent thanks so much everyone  my first days at work were okay  havent had the energy to post yet  its always worse in your head i guess  im feeling okay about my ex  i guess his words and actions just go to show i really dont need him in my life as sad and as disappointing as that is    thank you for your concern and support it really means a lot hello    it is a natural feeling  sounds like youre suffering from social anxiety  sometimes our minds play havoc and stop us from enjoying certain situations  youve probably just got into a couple of bad mental habits  there are things you can do to improve this  this website might help ive found it quite useful in the past how to overcome social anxiety with pictures  wikihow  wish you all the best i used to and still do have like a running monologue in my head that takes any opportunity to call me a shit haha  id do things as well like tense up when i was going to be around people my breathing became erratic  mostly it was that  id think too much about where to put my hands too  id grind my teeth a little too  i think if youre more relaxed those things tend to lessen quite a lot anyway so relaxation techniques really help hello and    we accept the love we think we deserve   it sounds like things are going really well in your relationship at the moment and your brains a bastard and is trying to find any way to make you feel like shit or sabotage a good thing  i have a mind like that i know where youre coming from   i would get in touch with your uni counsellor straight away cause shell be able to talk you through these worries and also give you strategies of how to feel more secure within yourself which will cripple the basis of these worries   hope you can push these thoughts out of your mind soon and i wish you and your partner lots of wonderfully happy times together im so sorry youre feeling this way valleygirl  hopefully today will be good for you when you wake up     have you told your gp about your sudden and extreme changes in mood hello and    im sorry youve been experiencing such a rough time  unfortunately i dont think ill be able to answer the question you had about why it happened its probably a multitude of factors that built up and caused a physical reaction in your body  sounds like you were experiencing panic attacks   the best way to avoid those feelings is to take good care of your mental health you should be feeling more secure in that now youre on medication  i would suggest you have some kind of talking therapy in order to identify what triggers these feelings in you and to help you come up with some strategies of how to deal with it when it does happen  once you have that solid basis your anxiety about your anxiety should lessen anyway as a result as youll feel more secure and ready to tackle the thing   this forum is really good as a means of talking or typing ha therapy  its helped me a lot  another good thing is to practice mindfulness and breathing techniques its about focusing your mind on your breathing or the world around you so your mind doesnt become bombarded with other things that can cause you to become anxious or depressed or be feeling out of control   these are things you should practise daily as the idea is to reprogramme your mind with healthier mental habits so you can better prevent any breakdowns   hope that helps  wish you all the best i suffer from anxiety and i was really worried when i had driving lessons i havent passed my test but thats because i never took it other things got in the way so haha   i found that once youre behind the wheel its a different experience  if you have a good driving instructor who is clear and supportive your anxiety will lessen as a result  once you get used to the controls you realise that in actually controlling the car its quite simple once you get your head around it  then when youre learning to drive on different kinds of roads youll have someone talking you through what to do and when  and they wont just make you go on a road youre not comfortable with straight away theyll build you up   when youre learning to drive its not uncommon to have these feelings of anxiety most people who ive talked to who have learned to drive have had dreams where they crash the car   it just shows youre concerned about not getting it wrong which will probably help you when you start learning   hope you can overcome this   god i wish i had a car youll have someone there to prevent you from doing that  and they have a brake on their side so its all good  i know the thing with anxiety is that sometimes its just not logical  hope you feel differently once youre in the car though i think you will i agree i think you should tell a mental health professional how youre feeling and theyll be able to help you make the call  im so sorry this episode is lasting so long for you  sounds like you need help yeah ive been there  abused sexually and then selfmedicating     ridethelightning i didnt struggle with selfmedicating as much as you seem to be right now but it was sometimes quite bad  if you ever need someone to talk to  someone whos been in a similar situation and has mostly come out the other side please pm me hello and welcome to the forum  i know what you mean about anxiety and paranoia at work  i think everyone experiences it to some extent its because its quite a false situation really where youre playing a role and so is everyone else and if you think about it too much it seems like a minefield   but it sounds like youre doing great  also theres things you can do to help you lessen the anxiety if its becoming too much of an issue for you  are you in touch with a therapist  does your work itself have any sort of counselling    are there any colleagues you feel comfortable enough to talk to about how youre feeling  hope you feel better soon wish you the best  remember try not to focus on how youre being perceived if you focus on being mint at your job everyone will love you anyway oh i know that  yeah its really good its about how your amygdela your emotional brain and how when thats activated you cant access your rational thinking  we were looking at it at school for those kids who come from difficult backgrounds   am i right thats really great to hear  being a perfectionist can be an amazing thing but its not a healthy mindset look up growth mindset versus fixed mindset  growth mindset is the idea that progress is always better than perfection it gives you the positivity to always be moving forward  whereas fixed mindset can go one of two ways as i understand it you believe youre really bad at something and therefore you dont try or you believe you should must have to be really good at something and the worry of not being perfect 100 of the time stops you in your tracks  you must learn to recognise that a little bit of failure is often part of the learning process and if youre willing to fail sometimes youll get way further than you ever would by being a perfectionist in the long run i know what you mean  when ive been for teaching interviews ive wanted to throw up  everyone feels the same on them they last all day and youre constantly being watched and scrutinised even though they tell you youre not which is ridiculous and then its almost worse afterwards because youre waiting for a bloody phone call  in teaching they try to ring you the same day  ive had colleagues who for whatever reason where rang a few days afterwards and they were visibly struggling with the anxiety  i dont know how youre coping with it its very stressful  i hope you get your answer soon and ive got my fingers crossed for you god im so sorry they havent called you yet  still wishing you the best im so sorry  drug addiction is a common result of being abused as a child especially sexually  please remember that you are worth it and you can get through this  please talk to a mental health professional asap 88  my worrying worries me  ha im sorry youre having a hard time accepting help right now  i remember feeling like that at your age  it was almost like ive got this far without any of your fucking help so i dont need it now either and then finding myself struggling even more and blaming myself because i was the person i was meant to be relying on  i dont know if you feel the same way its different for everyone but it doesnt have to be that you have to deal with this alone  you shouldnt  of course you had trouble telling anyone what happened you had enough trouble dealing with it let alone being the one to bring it out into the open and tell your loved ones  especially because that throws their perceptions of their loved ones in the dirt  its horrible that you should have to be the one to do that especially after everything youve been through  please do not blame yourself  none of this is your fault  and you do deserve help it seems like you need help right now and theres nothing wrong with that  i hope you can start to accept help soon you need to go to the dentist  purely to lessen your anxiety about the whole thing  youll be fine  ive had this before i was scared to go because i didnt take care of them as well as i should and when i went they were understanding and just told me what i needed to have done  you might have to have some treatment but its better than waiting and losing a tooth  you do not want to have root canal treatment  it is a bastard   when i get like that i often have dreams about breaking or losing my teeth   best thing to do is just bite the bullet ha and go  if youre worried about their reaction just open up a bit and apologise for not coming sooner and tell them how worried you are your teeth might not be in the best state theyll probably be very understanding ahh i see what you mean  hopefully once your dentist tells you youre all clear youll feel better  if not then are you in touch with any therapists  if you cant lessen the anxiety fully through physical measures then id go down that road  hope this doesnt trouble you for much longer i know its hard when it feels like nothings helping but youve got to keep going with that kind of stuff you cant as you say just deal with it on your own  as hard as it is you should keep pursuing different kinds of therapy until something works  people dont understand this shit ive had friends who are like get over it  frankly ive cut them out of my life  they werent helpful at all  im not saying you should do that  its not anyones fault they dont understand because they havent been through this  but dont expect yourself to be able to just shake it off and be okay  its too much to handle  im really glad you feel better today and i hope it continues i know that feeling  you can learn to manage this  dont worry  youre only young this will get better  youre right about the fact you shouldnt bottle it up because thats half the problem you need to deal with it rather than push it away because it creates tension that you cant control  i feel for you    also dont be too hard on yourself  youre not a burden youre struggling and its understandable as to why  i can understand the frustration of not being able to tell anyone but being really in a low place  it comes out  but it doesnt mean youre not worth it hey im sorry youre going through this  you dont sound nuts it sounds like youre suffering right now  panic attacks are awful especially when youre not getting the support you need from a loved one which makes you panic more  i hope youre feeling better now and have managed to get some sleep   i know it seems bad right now and you dont want this sort of thing to be happening all the time for both of your sakes  but you and your partner can move from this forward together  this can be sorted out       i think she needs to understand a bit more how her actions are affecting you and modify her behaviour accordingly and you need strategies to deal with the panic attacks when they come a bit of a compromise really   i suffer from panic attacks and my key piece of advice would be dont give into them dont panic  i try to ignore the pain in my chest and try to breathe and they tend to be over fairly quickly     thats really hard to do when youre anxious over a partner though  in that respect i would try to remind yourself that your partner loves you and that everything is okay in that department your partner should help you with this recognise that youre having a panic attack and therefore your thoughts should be taken with a pinch of salt and also you should try to distract yourself with something positive maybe a comedy show   its all much easier said than done though i know    have you seen a doctor about this    wish you all the best im not on the drugs youre on but i get that kind of stuff sometimes i find myself whispering help me when i feel really agitated or saying it over and over again in a whisper and i think what the actual fuck  i wouldnt worry  it sounds as though youre just feeling very agitated at the moment and youre having some unfamiliar sideeffects from the new drugs youre on  try to keep a log of when you feel particularly agitated so then maybe you can recognise whats triggering you and keep in close contact with your gp ohhh i see what you mean now  sorry  yeah i can understand why that would be confusing and disorientating  im sorry your doctor is not being as understanding as he could be  whatever the diagnosis it does sound as though hes taking your symptoms seriously by agreeing to reduce your medication i doubt a medical professional would be motivated by wanting to humour someone when it comes to giving them medication  hope it starts getting better for you soon youre not stupid they should have rang you by now  id say something like i understood that your decision was going to be made a few days ago and im just checking in on the progress of that decision as i have not yet been contacted  you deserve to know true that im sorry to ask you mustve said but i missed it what is sues job to you  youll be okay  may isnt for a while yet and well be here to support you  plus youll know about this job very soon and youll feel better about everything then if you havent received a response its perfectly okay to enquire again you could be having offers from other jobs by now so they need to let you know that sounds like a really positive step itll lessen your anxiety purely because you have a plan which gives you some level of autonomy with the situation  dont be scared about tapering your meds whatever you work towards together will be something thats good for you with an element of trial and error  its hard when your therapist isnt around but let her know youre worried and hopefully shell give you some strategies of how to deal with it  plus you have the forum im so sorry youre going through this anxiety is horrible  could you not go to the doctors for a checkup  that way its completely out of your mind and your doctor will hopefully give you something for the anxiety youre feeling too  they might be able to prescribe something or put you in touch with some support groups what id suggest for now is to try to have food thats very high in calories but fairly simple in terms of flavour  maybe a meal replacement drink is that what they said to do to take it as and when you need to to combat the anxiety  if so definitely yeah take the pill  hopefully things will get better  try to eat something as well  itll help you focus on stuff you wont  you sound like good people who are terrified of hurting anyone ive done this a lot  i suffered abuse as a child  i think its fairly normal and you shouldnt feel guilty about it  i know its hard but try not to look for love in this way for your own sake  because the more you affirm the idea that youre childlike and need to be looked after particularly with manipulation the further you are away from a full recovery  thats easier said than done though its hard to flick a switch and say i will now endeavour to be emotionally selfreliant because incredibly hard when you have low selfesteem and you probably feel very guilty for not being completely selfreliant already anyway i do almost constantly    there is a happy middle ground in the future though  where you feel like you can act authentically and independently where it matters but you can also count on other people because thats not a bad thing and everyone needs that  sorry to hear youre struggling like this  if you want someone to show you that they care its probably best to just be open about it i dont think people like to be deceived  hopefully you have people around you around whom you feel as though you can be properly honest ahh i know how you feel  its horrible when youre anxious because it feels as though thats all there is  especially if you suffer from longterm anxiety  you can learn to manage it though and it doesnt have to be forever  thats what i keep telling myself  how often do you feel anxious   sorry youre going through this  hope you have some relief soon im so sorry to hear you had a breakdown  dont worry it happens to a lot of people  i had to leave a job last year because i had a breakdown and ive had pretty rough childhood with abuse and stuff  i was off for a few months and then got a job again  youll get back on your feet    it sounds like you need to deal with whats hurting you from your childhood before you can move on  if i were you id just focus on your wellbeing then everything else will follow  has the therapy been helping  are there people you can spend time with dont suffer in silence  i know its hard to admit youre struggling but oh my days its so much harder to maintain the im fine persona when youre not fine  its fine to admit youre not okay  if you dont feel as though you can tell anyone in your life  which i totally understand  tell me  pm me if you like  it sounds as if we have a fair bit in common    i tend to moan like a bastard though  to be fair only in certain circumstances  i had to tell the people at work ive been going through a rough time recently and they were horrified i was suffering in silence for so long so i guess im a bit like you in a way  let it out when you feel able youll feel better  theres no reason to be ashamed of how youre feeling or what happened  thats just insult to injury youd do the same yes have a lovely sleep and remember theres always someone you can talk to hope that relieves the pressure even a little bit remember youre doing well because youre on the road to recovery and thats damn bloody hard peaceful dreams im so sorry jimmy  breakups are a terrible shock to the system   theres no other situation like it in most peoples lives  one day you have a loving partner whose life you share and the next everything changes theyre not there anymore and you have to weigh up everything in your life differently  and that person is different towards you  its like a death in that respect  and like the grounds been pulled from underneath you  i bet youre not eating sleeping cant concentrate always tearful and your body is like why is this happening  my colleagues going through this at the moment she drives me into work and shes in fucking pieces every minute of the day  it hurts so so so much for a while but it will get better  you will get through this  people do  i know that thought is totally alien to you at the moment and the last thing you want to happen but i hope you can find some solace in the fact that this pain is not forever  please surround yourself with understanding people dont allow yourself to focus on it too much  obviously let yourself feel the pain because you need to process it and get over it  but you must be kind to yourself  your body and your mind are going through a terrible trauma    the best thing you can do to allow yourself to heal is break it off you must think i cant do this to myself anymore i have to draw a line in the sand and then do it  you cannot be constantly going back and forth in your mind wanting to work things out because youll never allow yourself to heal  it doesnt sound like youre ready to do that yet and that is okay  its completely understandable  but one day you will and thats when youll start to get better because youll take some level of ownership over whats happening  until then be very very kind to yourself  do whatever you need to do to help yourself get to that break off point for yourself  if you need to talk to her again to finalise this and get a sense of closure do it  maybe it wont be the end  but at least youll know and you can move on from this no matter what the outcome  you cant live in this state for very long  i hope i havent upset you and i hope you feel better very very soon  focus on making new memories thats a great idea  you might want to invest in a dream catcher  this might be the very reason why they exist  might help i think its important to focus on the positives and the fact that youre dealing with your anxiety a lot better than you have done in the past  youre also at uni doing sports and have a parttime job  thats really difficult for someone who suffers with anxiety and you should give yourself real credit for that  i used to have similar thoughts when i was in uni i remember doing to a counselor and saying to him something like i dont know how to walk down the street  where do i look  where do i put my arms  everything i do seems wrong  i think uni is a really difficult time for anyone because youre basically forging your adult self and thats bloody hard to do  but the best piece of advice or comment really that someone gave me was that i was so scared of being the wrong thing that i wasnt letting myself be anything  i know its piss easy for me to say and its not like you can wave a magic wand and make it happen but i think your end goal should be to get into a mindset where youre not bothered about being a certain way  you might look like a dick to some people  some people wont like you  but you cant please everyone and trying to please everyone or not offend anyone or trying to stay unnoticed is just making you ill  it would make anyone ill  plus youll attract the right kind of company for you if you feel like you can be yourself  id suggest seeking counselling in uni youre so lucky in that respect  its free and really quick to access  then id try to build some deeper relationships by asking people to hang out with you when you feel a bit more comfortable doing that not easy i know because hopefully thatll give you a deeper sense of meaning and enjoyment in your life  im trying not to give advice which is as useless as basically hey  dont be anxious and i dont know if im succeeding but i really hope you start feeling more comfortable in yourself soon  ps dont judge your looks too harshly when you know youre feeling shitty anyway itll be affecting your judgement my anxiety is going through the roof im sorry you have such bad anxiety but im glad youre not having to put yourself through a life of stress at work  thanks for your kind words thanks so much for your kind words everyone  in moments like that i wonder whether i can cope  it went okay in the end though sounds like youre having a bit of an existential crisis which is perfectly normal when youre studying philosophy  i took philosophy for a level and it also comprised half of my degree i took philosophy  linguistics  my mum always said those courses fucked me up mentally and i do know what you mean  i remember coming out of as classes thinking that the whole world had changed forever  ive always been fascinated the limits of perception and the meaning of it all  your heads full of questions about the world and it always will be  you might find some answers to these questions but theyll be your answers and youll have no real way of knowing whether youre right because there seems to be a massive problem with being able to ever view things objectively  but thats fine  thats life i disagree with that  it has limitations because as soon as a question is properly answered them its no longer considered philosophy in many ways  but its hardly a dead end in the sense that we have questions about the world that we are not able to answer and these questions only lead to further questions  its a giant web that keeps growing the more we know thats true sorry i dont have time to view your video at the moment but i will have a peruse when i get a chance as i say once a question is answered its no longer philosophy  that doesnt mean that philosophy is a dead end though because its the birthplace of enquiry and it deals with probably the most important stuff there is  its where the important questions are first formed i know the definition of philosophy    well  the dictionary definition anyway  the actual meaning of it is often contested  but yes its a really common symptom of anxiety sometimes i dont even realise im breathing shallowly and then i realise all of a sudden and i feel breathless and even more panicked  have you tried breathing in for 2 seconds and breathing out for 7 or as long as you can  it apparently slows your heart rate really effectively  hope youre feeling okay today hi maw10  welcome to the forum   its a difficult question to answer because i dont know the answer myself i suffer from depression and anxiety and it has really put a strain on relationships in the past  im sorry to hear youre struggling at the moment   by incident with her ex do you mean that she cheated on you with her ex  because if so thats a completely understandable basis for your feelings of anxiety and thats something she should be helping you get over by actively rebuilding your trust in her   my advice generally with depression and anxiety is keep on with the medication its great youre on something  i hope its working for you keep in close contact with your gp to monitor any changes in your mood and maybe get some kind of talking therapy  im sure you know this already   its hard to do so when youre depressed but you should also find a way to focus on the positives in your life and take some time out to work on you  be it reading exercising or whatever it is that relieves your stress   hope you can get to sleep soon are you having any sort of therapy for your anxiety  you cant be doing with being so cautious about things that are only extremely slightly likely  youll end up wasting so much of your time and being so scared while doing it  please try to address your anxiety rather than the triggers because the triggers sound like theyre really nothing to worry about in reality  hope you feel better soon sometimes when i think of something really cringeworthy i basically twitch  i do a sharp intake of breath and my jaw clenches its really quick and involuntary  its so fucking embarrassing  i usually do it when im tired mostly at the end of the day when i routinely run through all the stupid shit ive said and done  there have been times though where ive been really tired and have nearly done it at work  i really need to be so conscious of it   i only started doing it a few years ago after quite a long stint of drug abuse about a year on unresearched untested technically legal drugs  wondering if anyones experienced a similar thing and whether theres anything i can do it alleviateprevent it   ill bring it up with my cbt therapist when i finally get an appointment  this is the first time ive really opened up a conversation about it outside my relationship because its so embarrassing i like to think its not so bad but its pretty noticeable my boyfriend and housemates have been a bit confused by it asked if im okay and stuff  its more when i think of something cringeworthy so it usually happens without any sort of external stimulus  im just sort of hoping noone notices  thanks for your kind words i struggle with this too  they say that people who suffer from anxiety often have problems being assertive  remember you dont have to yell youre probably going to make yourself feel worse by doing so as well haha and you can be assertive by just stating what it is you want in a positive way  ive made a bit of headway in this area ive found that being able to say no to things helps me to feel more in control and therefore more assertive  im sorry that people are talking down to you thats horrible and its difficult for anyone to deal with  remember that you can be assertive by just removing yourself from the situation  it shows that youre putting yourself first  and no you absolutely should not feel bad about standing up for yourself im sorry to hear youre going through this right now   it sounds like it is passing though which is good  you have reached out to us which is even better  i think you need to be with someone right now or at least talk to someone  is there anyone you know who you can be with at the moment  can you ring a suicide charity number    also please go to ae if youre still feeling wobbly   dont worry you can get through this i agree bluegrass  mami5 it is better not to hide this  the more they know the better they can help you  hope you are feeling better i think you should definitely talk to a professional so that you can identify what it is you are feeling as not knowing may be causing more anxiety about it  remember that panic attack or not there are things you can do to prevent these feelings from happening and it sounds like you have the support to help you achieve this thats understandable  the world will probably seem a hell of a lot more dangerous to you now especially since you dont have the answers yet about what happened  please talk to someone about this it might be best to talk to a professional about these fears because you dont want those fears to fester and to stop you from enjoying your life  good luck at the funeral  i hope it gives you a sense of closure  ask people for support if necessary im sure youll be able to sort something out  it sounds like you need some time out of work if possible to focus on yourself  are you currently receiving any therapy    it may be hard for you but i think it would be really good if you opened up to your friends at work and just explain that what happened was a culmination of many things that were out of your control and that you are now going to take steps to fix these  even if youre not sure what they are yet  just remember youre not a bad person and you can get through this  best of luck i can really empathise with your feeling of being out of control and wanting to erase the past  i guess the standard advice would be to identify what it is that makes you feel like this first of all  do you feel youve made any headway in this area from past therapycounselling i cant imagine what youre going through  one of my housemates has recently lost his mum and i feel equally unable to give advice   i know that people often feel the need to know answers when someone has been untimely taken from them because it gives them a sense of closure  unfortunately this truth may take a long time to come to light  what i would suggest is to find some sense of personal closure for your loss   my housemate wrote a letter to his mum and then burned it he said it helped him because it helped him get all of his feelings out and because his mother was cremated he perceived a connection between the letter and his mum  it doesnt even have to make sense to anyone else it can just be personal to you and your friend and still be powerful and significant  my advice would be try and do something cleansing if you can while you wait for answers   i assume the funeral is soon this can be your starting point for closure also   im sorry you have to go through so much pain  take the support of the people around you give support  pm me any time hi   this sounds like a mental health issue to me although obviously im not a professional  have you spoken to your gp about this  they might be able to define this and give you some help   i really hope you can find some help and resist the urge to become homeless  it might seem better than what you have now due to your anxiety about your life at the moment but it cant truly be better than what you have now  youll be cold lonely hungry ignored and in serious danger  dont let it get to that point  httpwwwchannel4comnewsleehalinvestigation   thinking of you do you mean the kind of meeting situations where everyone has to introduce themselves onebyone  if so i find this very anxietyinducing too in fact i hate it  i think its the act of waiting for your turn listening to what other people are saying and not wanting to be the one to mess it up  if im on the right lines just try to remember that everyone there is in the same boat thats understandable  your evaluation of the situation sounds right when youre doing your own presentation you feel in control whereas when youre asked out of the blue to introduce yourself youre suddenly out of control and on the spot    i dont know how helpful this is because i find this situation very stressful too  i tend to practise what im going to say in my head beforehand  this is only really possible if youre not one of the first people to be put on the spot  usually its about three things you need to say isnt it  im name  im here because thing and perhaps even the dreaded something unique about me is  i try to get those things together say them as clearly as possible and then turn to the next person to indicate my turn is finished haha  you might want to build on something someone else has said as well to make yourself feel more at ease  like such a person im also or something\n",

      "doc: im not familiar with drugs or whether they can have lasting effects like youre having but it does sound like youre experiencing anxiety   i would talk to a doctor if i were you 7080 of your day is a lot of time to be feeling this way and they might be able to help you   i dont know how youd feel about taking medication but there are meds that can help and there might also be talking therapies on offer some areas also do short courses in cbt or other therapy skills so it gives you a tool to use against the anxiety restless legs are something i deal with and i know its because of my social anxiety having all that flight or fight energy with no real outlet just leads to legs spontaneously moving to release it  its odd i have a very clicky neck too  but my posture is awful from where ive walked around with my head down avoiding eye contact and having to deal with facing people its left me with a slight curve around my shoulders im wondering if perhaps it could the the same thing with you   dont underestimate what mental health can do to your physical wellbeing its amazing how it can effect you hello i see this post is from several weeks ago so im not sure if youre still checking in on the forum  im sorry you didnt get a reply sooner    i think youre being too hard on yourself about this situation   its understandable that you might feel guilty to some degree but you mustnt torment yourself with it   you are looking back on a situation with hindsight and at the time you didnt know better you didnt have the information about marriage after 30 back then    you probably dont keep in contact with this woman but you dont know her circumstances now she might be very happy and here you are feeling really awful for no good reason   i know it must be difficult but its essential that you forgive yourself hiya i see this post is from a few days ago sorry youve not had a response yet   i can understand why youd be feeling anxious at an increase in medication  its always trial and error to get to the right dosage and you have to weigh up the pros and cons in your mind as to whether its advantageous to increase a dose    do you think that having seen how much 10mg has helped increasing the dose might help you more  or are you happy to continue with where youre at  also im wondering if youve been offered any kind of therapy alongside your medication its all very well taking meds but usually it takes more to really start making progress   im sorry to hear of your selfesteem issues unfortunately most medication of mental health has weight gain as a side effect   again you have to take into consideration the benefits that the medication brings you   personally im classed as severely obese but without the medication im on id be suicidal if its literally saving my life then sod it my weight can just be as it is    do you know what size you are at the moment i had a phase where i just had to accept what i was it may just be a number but the implications can make you feel pretty crappy  what helped me is really valuing myself and thinking actually i deserve to wear clothes that are comfortable and if that means buying a certain size then so be it    if high street shops dont stock your size they dont stock mine then online shopping can be good if you dont have a big budget ebay is pretty good for getting a bargain  you really are doing the best you can and fighting through some difficult issues and as i said you deserve to be comfortable    i think that when you dont feel good about yourself its easy to stop caring about yourself but feeling low is all the more reason to make the most of yourself misskitty has given you some great advice which i cant really add too  so really i just wanted to say that i hear you and know exactly how you feel when i was 16 i was so awful and like you i got my mum to basically speak for me but im 23 next week and can tell you that ive definitely got much better i live on my own now so i have to be able to answer the phone and be the responsible one who does the shopping etc restaurants are a whole different ball game though i know eating and ordering food is a big issue for me and a lot of people who have social anxiety  one thing i have found helpful is to always have a bottle of water on me when im really nervous i sip at it its good because its obviously a healthy habit but it also keeps you present in your body you obviously cant breathe really fast and drink at the same time so it helps calm my breathing and finally if youve got a mouthful of water the silences dont feel so bad because nobody expects you to speak while youve got your mouth full hey lu havent spoken to you here on the forum for a while    i know its really difficult not to worry especially when you have the association in your mind of what happened with your mum in my opinion its probably natural that this might make you feel scared   please dont blame yourself just because youve had it if anything try to take reassurance from the fact that you had it but youre better now   if its any consolation ive been struggling with this to i do have irritable bowel syndrome and for some reason really cold or really hot weather can trigger it also even if you enjoy christmas its still stressful and our bodies can react to that by eliminating waste quicker than normal sounds like what youre experiencing is having quite a big effect on your life at the moment    medication is a double edged sword because it can help but it seems with all medication theres a trade of sorts where one thing gets better but at a cost  the weird side effects  i suppose you have to try and evaluate whether or not any positive effects the medication is having outweighs the negatives  i do think that the effectiveness of medication depends on the length of time youve taken it and at what dose among many other things  it really is your decision what you do  i cant really tell you what to do because only you know whats best    that dream state sounds like derealisation to me its something ive dealt with for a long time and it can be really horrible and at times frightening unfortunately its one of those things that gets worse the more anxious you are and theres no treatment for it other than to be less anxious    as for the driving lessons is the anxiety about driving itself or more of a social anxiety related to being in a car with an instructor  i found driving lessons hard due to social anxiety and not wanting to be in a confined space like a car with a stranger   do you practice with someone you know in the car with you at all   i think you have to do these things when the time is right for you if you give it a rest for a while until things improve dont be too hard on yourself about it   on the other hand you dont want the anxiety to win and stop you from achieving something  even if it is scary you can be successful has maddie got any underlying illness  its not cheap to go to a vet but that might be an option if youre really worried  i think animals are very intuitive and it may be that shes picking up on your anxiety and so is behaving weird because she can tell youre worried if its bad you can feed her on plain rice for a few days but itll clear itself up im sure she might have eaten or licked something outside that wasnt very good for her while i agree it wont address the root of the problem i think meditation could be beneficial if you practise it regularly it might reduce your overall stress levels  also depending on the type of meditation it could help you when things are bad say if you do a breathing meditation breath in to the count of four hold to the count of four exhale to the count of four the next time you feel overwhelmed it may help to do that also mindfulness meditation is good if you practise mindfulness you will be more aware of your thoughts and your thought patterns and so have better insight into what leads up to you feeling anxious oh and as for emdr i really dont know enough about it to say if it would be helpful or if you could do it yourself definitely agree with what others are saying about how people can pick up on our own uneasiness and then start to feel awkward around us as a result centurion when you asked how do i make it go away what did you mean the anxiety itself or the thoughts you have around the anxiety i can tell by your post youre thinking a lot which is what anxious people do so well in my experience and id like to see if i could give some advice  but im a bit confused sorry it does sound like youve got social anxiety as opposed to general anxiety but im not an expert and sometimes general can lead to social and vice versa  i totally get what you mean about fightingworrying about the anxiety i think if youre putting yourself under pressure to be talkative and sociable youre more likely to freeze up  are you getting any medicalpsych treatment for your social anxiety at the moment   personally i have found an ssri to be useful ive not suddenly started wanting to give lectures to hundreds of people but its silenced the innercritic enough for me to have some breathing space  do you find there are situations that youre better in than others   for me im most comfortable in a group of about 5 people anything bigger makes me anxious but i hate oneonones with someone im not familiar with also i prefer it when im doing something practical with others watching a film craft bowling etc because if the conversation stops its not awkward  find the situations you feel more relaxed in and do more of whatever that is  the more positive experiences you have of not being so anxious or making a fool of yourselfupsetting peoplewhatever you fear doing the better it can be helpful to have a bank of good evidence that you can draw upon whenever the anxiety kicks in i know this thread is a few days old but just thought id say that something ive found very helpful is the reassurance that its unlikely ill faint when i get lightheaded too my psychiatrist explained to me that when youre anxious your body is doing the opposite of what it would if it was about to faint fainting is caused by a drop in blood pressure whereas anxiety causes a raise in blood pressure and heart rate its been good for me to remind myself of that maybe it might be useful for you too its a positive affirmation you can make to yourself like melonheadgirl said also i agree that while ive been shy for as long as i can remember my anxiety was definitely learned i hope things get a bit easier for you anxiety is so unpleasant and can have such a big effect on your life thats a really good question which to be honest i didnt think to ask  i could speculate about how perhaps hyperventilating disturbs oxygencarbon dioxide balance but seeing as i dont even have a gcse in science id probably be making a fool of myself personally i find it can only really help with a specific anxiety that you can do something about  say for instance im worried that someone in my family may be hurt i can phone them and talk to them which reassures me   that generalised sense of anxiety where theres nothing you can put a finger on i havent found cbt to be that helpful because for me cbt boils down to distracting yourself which is hard to do if youve got physical symptoms of anxiety all the time   this is only my opinion however if you have the opportunity to do it and its not going to cost a fortune it might be worth exploring   if not a cbt based selfhelp book might be good just for you to get a sense of what its about  ive got the cbt workbook for dummies ive not read it covertocover but its good to dip in and out of   i hope you manage to get some sort of relief soon whether thats through therapy or medication or whatever i agree with weeman  it would be a good idea to speak to a professional   in answer to your question about whether or not your too anxious it all depends on the amount of impact the anxiety youre experiencing is having on your life and general wellbeing   it sounds to me like its bad enough that youre daytoday living is being affected would you agree   there are lots of different types of anxiety that come within the anxiety umbrella and they can and often do crossover  im waffling a bit now but basically i would suggest you speak to someone  ideally a doctor who would be able to decide where you can go for some support i agree with parayana please try to resist hurting yourself if you can    insomnia is awful but its even worse when you know youve got an early start    i know its so difficult when youre so frustrated but try to relax yourself because they say the more you get wound up the less likely you are to sleep   hope you manage to get some rest soon do you feel like the medication is working well enough for you besides from the issues you are getting with foods  i have had similar experiences with foods for some reason apples can have that effect on me too  i think when your blood sugar gets low you can get very shaky and nauseous it mimics an anxiety attack very well i think it feels so similar that the brain gets confused and so you become more panicky  have you kept a food diary to see what is triggering this response do you eat enough and at regular intervals   it might be worth seeing a doctor just to rule out a physical cause for what youre experiencing it may be a food intolerance or your blood sugars might not be stable hey cottoncandy  just out of interest are you based in the uk   i think a lot of mental health professionals here will basically say youre fine just to get you off of their caseload    im not sure if its part of their training to be told to be provocative and antagonising   i dont know if they think that by being useless youll freak out and thatll be some kind of break through   even if its not the case i do think they play mind games which i cant deal with id much rather complete honesty   ive come across one therapist who i dont think should be practising at all she was absolutely atrocious luckily i had enough selfesteem to see it for the rubbish that it was and stopped attending the sessions   another therapist completely ignored and undermined me when i was telling her about the abuse i was experiencing at home  for the first time in my life i tried to talk about being raped and what the person did to me her response was that some people enjoy that   please do not question your own judgement if your therapist is making you feel undermined and not listened to its not you  its them this probably isnt very helpful but i did experience something similar taking citalopram i carried on taking it and still do now because slowed cognitive type thinking is preferable to crippling anxiety and feeling suicidal  i think there are side effects with all medications sometimes the pros outweigh the cons and life is more tolerable on medication welcome to the forum   i understand where youre coming from im very anxious and very lonely    this forum does help me a lot because i dont  have much if any social contact offline   if youre feeling up to it do post here on the forum because there are plenty of people who understand how you feel   the chillout section is great for general chat hi gingercat and welcome to the forum    im wondering  when youre going about your daytoday life do you really feel your anxiety or would you say you are on more of an autopilot kind of mode   the only reason i ask is that some people are so anxious that their brain zones out to the point of dissociationderealisation and that defence mechanism is a protective thing  and it allows people to seem quite functioning when actually theyre really suffering   if that does fit its ok i just wanted to check in and see   as you say its not easy to really get much benefit from cbt if you dont really have any clear thought patterns that are leading you to be anxious   have you had an overall health check it might be an idea to rule out anything physical that can cause people to feel like this i know having an underoveractive thyroid can affect peoples mental health   also have you talked to a doctor about this at all  if its something youd consider and it felt right for you there are medications that might help too hi runaway welcome to the forum    just want to say i can relate to the tormenting and obsessive kind of thoughts  ive experienced that too and also with a guy that was totally unsuited in fact id say he was toxic to me   as painful and frustrating as it is im pretty sure youre going to get answers from this guy  i know its upsetting and you feel like you need help in order to process whats happened but i think that any further attempts at communicating with him will only leave you more confused and hurt   for whatever reason he is unable to communicate and is stuck in his patterns   you know this  youve said yourself he seemed incapable of empathy or selfexpression   i think now is the time to draw a line in the sand and accept that he has a huge amount of issues that hes not looking at  dont take any of his negativity on board or punish yourself for whats happened   we all do things against our intuition because were not ready to learn a lesson   i know that when i was fixated on toxic guy i let him get away with abusing me   there was something inside of me that knew what was happening all along but wasnt prepared to accept it   i spent time looking inward at what it was i was wanting from him and how i could give that to myself   i also understood that id met him at a time when i was vulnerable and he was a really convenient distraction from all of the shit going on in my family dynamic  i was desperate to break free from the family stuff that was weighing me down and on some level i think i was counting on him as being my ticket away from all the pain and grief that i was feeling about my family   so   im also wondering if its possible for you to look for a job elsewhere   i know you shouldnt have to change your job for the sake of one asshole but its going to be hard to move on if hes there   he sounds very clever at manipulation  hell give you enough affection to keep you hanging on when he senses youre done but will ignore you the rest of the time  its controlling and not easy to ignore   i also wonder if youve got access to any counselling or therapy  the things in your past are probably influencing you really strongly and not for the right reasons with a bit of support you could start to untangle the mess and start to feel more empowered ah i apologise  i wasnt sure where youre from  being from the uk i assumed you might be able to get counselling on the nhs   have you read up on the idea of selfcare  theres a lot of material out there and it can be really nice to explore little daytoday rituals that you can do just to honour yourself  even if its just a fancy bubble bath or a really nice hot drink   not sure if journalling is something youve tried either  one book that helped me is the creative journal the art of finding yourself its not a traditional dear diary type of book its a lot more than that and some days it encourages you to draw how you feel rather than write theres other activities like mapping your time drawing your ideal self writing down your positive traits etc that can be really helpful   basically i recommend doing anything that encourages selfesteem and treasuring yourself even if it feels really alien at first   it can have a knockon effect and help you in putting up boundaries so people like him cant get in hiya welcome to the forum  im really sorry to hear youre in this dilemma    depression and anxiety can go hand in hand and it can create a vicious cycle just like youre experiencing  its clear that this is really affecting your life   im not a doctor but ive been diagnosed with having gad it is basically that feeling you describe of having panic and anxiety for no obvious reason   for me i get anxiety about everything and nothing    i dont want to pressure you at all but i have to say that citalopram has been one thing thats helped me massively   its prescribed for both depression and anxiety so it can reduce both   it can make you feel a bit weird for the first week or two i noticed my eyesight felt a bit wonky nothing that wearing my glasses more often couldnt fix though but it does settle down   is there any particular thing youre worried about when it comes to taking it its tricky when you know you are prone to paranoid thoughts because it can mean its hard to fully trust your own judgement   you sound like you are an intuitive person though and so id say that if youre picking up on a bad vibe from someone theres usually something in it   sometimes people pick up on when someones an empath and will try to hook you in and drain you  have you heard of the term psychic vampire   how are your boundaries in general do you feel youre able to assert yourself and say no when needed  it can feel very weird not to get drawn into something when its so natural to you to be caring but its important not to take on board other peoples stuff   do you do much in terms of visualising a protective bubble or light around you  having the intention set that you are protected can be quite powerful as can visualising any unhealthy attachments and cords falling away   im someone that doesnt go out a lot really i dont have a social life yet i find myself  confronted by people who seem out to get me a lot  i know its because they think they can take advantage of me because im really empathic  but its important not to let those experiences completely cloud my vision  there are other people out there who are similar to me and are kind compassionate people   also try not to take things too personally  people will pick on anybody who they see as being vulnerable if you werent there theyd find someone else  i used to thing something was wrong with me if so many people were picking on me but i have come to realise theyre barely seeing me for who i am at all they just see a target ergh sorry youve having to deal with their ignorance as well as your own mental health issues    some people find it very difficult to accept that mental health problems are real   if youre talking about inlaws im guessing theyre of an older generation where these things werent talked about    having said that its not just older people ive had younger people not accept mental health issues and its incredibly frustrating   it can feel like theyre basically saying they know better than you do about your own mind    have you printed out any fact sheets on your mental health conditions i think websites for mind or rethink have them and suggested they read it do you think thats something theyd be open to doing it would be really nice to be offered some of these treatments but because i pay for a private counsellor because i cant talk to anybody at the cmht im not allowed  maybe ill have to dig out my old cbt for dummies workbook thats if i havent already chucked it out when ive been suicidal in the past depends on what type of tablets there are several different types that they use for anxiety  at the moment i take an ssri antidepressant  citalopram while medication can only do so much personally citalopram has been one of the best things for me to help with anxiety i do still get anxious thoughts around what ifs but in terms of social anxiety and physical symptoms it helps me a lot and i know id be very different without it  im also prescribed lorazepam a benzodiazepineto take only when things are very bad and im not coping to be honest it makes me very drowsy and sends me to sleep and im aware that the day after taking it my mood can get low and i become more tearful its good in the sense that it can give you some rest but its worth noting that it can sometimes make you feel worse in other ways  i know there are other meds like betablockers and pregablin but i dont have experience of taking those not sure if youve come across a symptom of panic attack being an impending sense of doom but it sounds similar to what you are describing   i do think panic attacks can have a scale but in my opinion and experience there are also different sorts  some attacks are very physical think nhs website while others can be more mental and thoughtbased with fewer physical symptoms   for me ive got several sorts ranging from something bad is going to happen and i want to frantically phone everybody to check theyre ok hands are shaking i feel sick i want to cry right through to ive got to get out of here now i want to scream really loud and shove people hard in the face run outside to get some fresh air because i cant fucking breathe   the joy of anxiety i cant really add much else to what sarahd has said really   but i do just want to reply and send some hugs because it sounds like your anxiety is really putting you through the wringer at the moment    if the betablockers are making things worse i would suggest going back to your doctor because there might be something else that you can try that might be better suited to you they might try a benzodiazepine or something like that   i really hope things start to improve for you soon anyway i suppose what theyre saying about totting up a score for one particular year isnt really the main thing i take from this article  i think just seeing potential stressors written out is helpful reminder for me to understand why my anxiety has varied over time   i am surprised to see christmas so low down in the list though im already anxious about it hi beth and welcome to the forum  nobody here is a professional so we cant diagnose you with anything but i did wonder if perhaps you may be showing signs that are like ocd though of course sometimes a label is just a label  it sounds like anxiety is really causing you problems  im sure you might know that a lot of physical health issues can be caused by anxiety so its easy to get into a vicious circle  anyway i think that because its really starting to affect your life badly you should make an appointment to see your gp and discuss whats going on for you  they should be able to recommend a way forward for you it does sound like youre suffering with anxiety and possibly social anxiety   whilst i still get anxiety i think ive come on a long way with my social anxiety and so i suppose i just want to encourage you to get all of the help you can because it is possible for things to get better   ultimately the best thing you can do is expose yourself to your fear by going out and trying new activities that would involve meeting people  i found that there were less scary things to do than others   for instance going to a meditation group where the aim is relaxation closing your eyes and not talking to people was a really good place for me to start if youd have asked me to go shopping in a busy town centre at the weekend theres no way i would have done it  so maybe try to think about what activities you could do  when youre ready to push yourself in the future thats interesting to note i think ensuring that our levels of all vitamins and minerals is something that can affect physical and mental health positively i do wonder if its possible that too much copper could causes issues the only reason i ask is if somebody does suspect a deficiency could it be a bad idea to take supplements without a doctor recommending it hey catnut welcome to the forum  have you heard anything since writing your letter  i was going to suggest that you write a letter to put your version of events forward but im glad thats something youve already done i really hope the councilstrata are understanding   do you have a contact number for anybody there not sure how you would feel about making a phone call to ask if your letter has been received and if there are any updates to the case   it might be nerveracking to call them but would it be worse than waiting and fearing every day   also have you tried asking the children to be quiet or speaking to their mother i can understand if thats a bit of a nono since she complained about you but its just a thought  i dont think its unreasonable to ask for children not to scream or be too noisy but im guessing if the mother hasnt taught her children manners yet its unlikely she will   i think what your doing with earphones is a good idea by the way any little thing you can do that helps is good   im sorry to hear there doesnt seem to be much support for anxiety in your area  do you have access to transport i wonder if there is something a bit further that you might be able go to i really hope the professional help comes along sooner rather than later  it sounds like youre really struggling and are suffering with some quite severe symptoms  are you ukbased spooks the reason i ask is that i think it would be a really good idea to have regular contact with a gp whilst youre waiting for the professional help to be arranged  it may be that you need medication  not just for mental health but there are certain medications that can help physically such as betablockers if youre having bad symptoms with the anxiety   i know that medication isnt really a cure and is more something to help manage symptoms than it is to address the root of it all but it might be something to consider you can come here to rant  dont apologise or anything like that  youre free to come and go and post as you please   im glad that meds and counselling seem to be going well for you are you discussing the child abuse at counselling just wondering if thats whats bringing all of this back up for you or are there other things going on that you are finding triggering i guess its very difficult given the fact that these sorts of subjects seem to be in the news a lot of the time   its really difficult when youve experienced trauma to get it out of your head  i know that one  aside from the counselling are you seeing a doctor at all it might be a good idea to make them aware of whats going on  whilst you say that youre not at that point of wanting to take your own life yet if that ever changes you must talk to your doctor right away it would be tragic for you to have come so far only for things to end  all i can really suggest is the usual stuff of practising relaxation and distraction have you explored or found anything that works for you sorry i didnt reply earlier i definitely relate to what youre saying   you mustnt feel stupid ridiculous or embarassed though the thing is anxiety is irrational and can make you automatically assume the worst  i suppose if what you were worried about was rational it wouldnt be considered anxiety at all the whole point is that its not always based on reality  so dont be too hard on yourself  to be honest id have been anxious too if i needed to contact someone and my phone was nearly out of battery so what you felt wasnt silly at all  you know you said you would have been able to get home anyway did you have that thought after all of this or were you able to reassure yourself at the time that you could have got home i think we live and learn and so next time anything like this happens you can draw on these experiences and hopefully reassure yourself whilst your panicking that there is a solution to whatevers going on hmm thats an interesting question   its hard to say if ive got more or less anxiety than i did 5 years ago  the intensity feels the same  however the nature of the things that give me anxiety has changed quite significantly  i think the anxiety i get now feels far more serious and based on reality welcome to the forum titus   its really difficult when your body seems to be constantly aching and not working as youd like it to be but dont underestimate the effect that stress and anxiety can have physically  personally ive found it difficult to accept that mental health can cause me to feel so physically unwell but it really does   anyway i think relaxation techniques like amathus has suggested is a really good place to start if its not something youve already tried welcome to the forum   waverunner is right it does take a while for medication to work however sometimes antidepressants can actually make things worse the risk is higher if youre 25 or under but it can happen to anyone  if you think this is the case then i would go straight back to your gp and explain whats going on there is a risk that if youre one of those people who find that antidepressants make you worse it could lead to suicidal ideation which you obviously dont want to be going through welcome to the forum hedgewitch    are you a hedgewitch by the way i do like a bit of hedgewitchery    youre definitely not dumping by posting here oh and im sorry to hear your husband doesnt always listen to you must get a bit frustrating sometimes   ive noticed youve said youre applying for a new job good luck with that  it sounds like your current boss is a bit of a nightmare fingers crossed youll find a less stressful working environment i dont like eating in public or being in crowded places so i understand that anxiety  you shouldnt let that stop you from celebrating though  that is if you want to celebrate chances are most people arent even looking at you  if theyre not talking to someone theyre probably on their mobile phone  its hard to get past that spotlight effect that anxiety has  that feeling everyone is looking at you and judging you  but it couldnt be further from the truth     oh and i know this is a bit of an aside but do i sound like a cow if i say that even if i had a boyfriend id still find the whole valentines day thing extremely embarrassing whilst im not diagnosed with gad i can definitely relate to what youre experiencing  tense achy body and hypervigilance i get startled to easily   i find a hot water bottle can help with the aching as for being so easily scared i tend to wear headphones and listen to music a lot so im not so sensitive to loud noises thats what sets me off more than anything an unexpected loud noise oh no youve really been through the wars havent you    get well soon mm and i hope youre not suffering too much  cracked ribs sound very painful do you really think shed react like that or is it your anxiety thats making you believe shell take what you say badly   i dont think you sound pathetic at all it sounds like youre struggling with anxiety anyway but this situation with your friend is a particular trigger and is making you feel a bit insecure   im sure that deep down your friend will always value your friendship more as youve known each other for longer and it sounds like youre really close   do you think you could be reassured by talking to your friend about your worries or do you feel that your worries are deeper than that  what i mean is sometimes in spite of assurance anxiety can continue regardless because thats just how anxiety is    i have to say that theres a situation similar to this in my own life except im the other friend  one of my friends has a best friend theyve known each other since they were small children and my friend describes her as a sister  the thing is i know that theyre really close and i respect that i wouldnt seek to change their friendship in any way id hate to think id caused friction between them  but its very hard because my friends friend doesnt seem to like me very much at all i think she feels insecure and as though im trying to take her friend away but thats far from the case  so yeah speaking from someone who understands this kind of dynamic from the others perspective you dont know what this new couple are feeling im sure that if they are mature kind people theyll completely understand that youve got a strong bond with your friend and nothing will change that i think youve come up with a pretty good way forward yourself yes counselling might help you its possible that you might need to see a psychiatrist for medication too but how much medication can make you feel better is pretty limited in order to help you move forward it takes a good combination of talking it through and finding better coping mechanisms it may be that you should see if there are any anger management courses in your area too it could well be due to adhd issues robo adhd is not something ive had and ill be honest and say i know very little about it and how it affects people in adulthood but its very possible it could be contributing  or maybe even causing  these outbursts i think this is all the more reason to talk to a professional who knows more about these things than i do its been a very long time that ive had sleeping problems   i can relate to what youre saying about a feeling of being unsafe around sleep  except im the opposite in which id rather be alone in my flat and cant sleep when im around other people even though on one level i trust people a part of me still has doubts  youre very vulnerable when you sleep   something that has helped me is putting a mosquitonet type thing around my bed you can get some that are actually really pretty mine has bunting around the hoop  i think having that layer of fabric around me helps me feel more protected  i also check all of my locks before i sleep that sounds like a really frightening and humiliating experience    it may be a side effect of medication i know its not always a wise move but have you read the patient information leaflet that came with your medication to see what the side effects were  sometimes it can help to take a look so that you know whether what youre experiencing is down to the medication or not  out of curiosity what medicine is it   i was also going to ask if youve ever heard of or have been diagnosed with dissociation at all  it sounds as though this may also be quite likely to explain what happened   its made far worse when youre feeling stressed and people do have that kind of amnesia that you describe   read up on dissociation if you havent already also see whether anything like what youve experienced has been listed as a potential side effect  and either way i really think you need to make your doctor aware of what happened welcome to the forum    i think that perhaps you should make an appointment with a different doctor and then ask them for a referral to a mental health team or any other specialist services in your area  the thing is you dont have to disclose precisely what your thoughts are about if you dont want to  if i were you id say something like i am having intrusive thoughts that are of a sexual nature and they are causing me a huge amount of distress  if they ask you to be more specific tell them that you are uncomfortable with describing them   am sorry to hear that youre struggling with this  i dont know if what i experience is classed as an intrusive thought or is more of a ptsd kind of thing  but often i get horrible images of things happening to my loved ones its really horrible and upsetting  i generally try to distract myself and if it gets too much take a nap so that i dont have to be awake or conscious probably not the best coping mechanism but it works for now have you been seen by a mental health specialist  a gp is only good to a certain extent it would probably be better if you could be seen by a psychiatrist or psychologist  it may also be that medication isnt the answer and you need an approach thats more focused on therapy and talking   would you feel able to ask your gp to be referred to the mental health team i really think you might be able to get more suitable help that way yes i have the same experience i cant keep my legs still at night and im a very longterm insomniac had trouble with sleep for at least the past 12 years when it started in my early teens thoth is right in that some benzodiazepines can help but these arent drugs that are prescribed willingly by doctors and if they did theyd only let you have a short course of them because theyre highly addictive  there are alternative things ive found helped  a hot water bottle putting a pillow under my knees drinking chamomile tea  i do think though that its an overall sign of being anxious though some medications can actually give you restless legs antidepressants antipsychotics hi welcome to the forum i noticed youre new   the trouble with most if not all medication is that there are side effects i do think that the first month or so on a new medication does leave you feeling a bit weird it takes a good couple of weeks to fully adjust  i bet if you look at the patient information leaflet that comes in the box with your medication youll find a lot of what youre experiencing is considered a common side effect  so while its not nice to experience it in some odd way it should be reassuring to know youre not alone with it and i do think these things will get better i had all kinds of symptoms starting my medication i can remember feeling very nauseous doing the jaw clenching feeling very spaced out i would say the dry mouth is the only symptom that has persisted and low sex drive but that doesnt matter to me  but yes similar to you ive found the benefits of my medication outweigh the unpleasant side effects they would have told you if your test had come back positive with the hiv  theres absolutely no way they wouldnt have told you  i suspect that the stress youre feeling may be making your herpes symptoms worse  stress and anxiety puts your body under more pressure than you might believe  it really can make you feel absolutely awful are you getting any help for your anxiety welcome to the forum i think its worth discussing this with a professional nobody here can really diagnose you and theyll be able to point you in the right direction are you on any medication for anxiety at all sometimes medication can cause this sort of thing though its very rare a friend of mine used to have a nervous tic but she got help and within 6 months it was gone am telling you that because i want you to know that its very possible to overcome this welcome to the forum i know its not always something people are willing to try but am wondering if youve been on any medication like an antidepressant for your anxiety the biggest thing that ive found makes a difference to my social anxiety is taking my citalopram i think its a really good idea to try and take supplements   have you ever tried a light box sometimes that can help too though im unsure as to when you should use it if youre working night shifts because it might just make your body clock worse   when you say youre worried about the sleep do you mean just not getting enough of it the childhood labels we pick up eh  theyre really bloody useless and totally outdated but its really hard to just peel them off   just try to remind yourself whenever you find yourself thinking along these lines that indeed those ideas arent relevant now and they never were   also anger isnt the enemy it can be a very good guide and help us to really get in touch with whats good for us and what isnt im pleased to hear that things are getting a bit better for you   i can recall seeing some of your posts in the past and know youve not been in a good place with your anxiety  have you read up on though distortions at all its by no means a cure by ive always found it helpful to identify how my thinking is wrongdistorted which in turn helps me come up with a more balanced thought welcome to the forum   occasionally i will get thoughts that im seriously ill usually i think i have a brain tumour or that im going to have a heart attack  but as you said its the anxiety itself which causes these symptoms and so its very easy to end up stuck in a vicious circle   i cant work out from your screenname if youre male or female sorry but am wondering if this feeling hot and feverish ties in with your menstrual or hormonal cycle at all  i know that i used to really sweat buckets and feel very hot before my period even though my temperature was actually fine there are websites out there where you can track your period and make a note of how you are feeling i used to use mymoodtracker   i wonder if its worth doing so that if you are experiencing a lot of anxiety about how youre feeling you might find it reassuring to see its part of a cycle and that youll feel better ooh this is a bit of an old thread but i want to recommend bach flower rescue remedy too  its really helped me in both every day and more acute anxiety x hey parissa   i think obviously only you can know whats best for you but just wanted to say that if you are really not coping the lorazepam is there to help  its still early days from when you came out of hospital and you should take as long as you need to feel better  i understand that perhaps youre eager to get back to work in january even though its making you anxious but remember that theres only one you and your wellbeing is the most important thing x panic attacks can be really horrible  im sorry that youre experiencing them and it seems youre experiencing them a lot too    its difficult enough to deal with anyway but it must be superdifficult in your line of work i know you already know this but i am sure if your colleagues knew what you were going through theyd be supportive its definitely not a sign that youre in any way incapable    in my experience when i get low blood sugar it can mimic the symptoms of a panic attack i get the shakes and really out of breath  so make sure you try to keep on top of that carry a banana or a cereal bar with you in your handbag so you know youve got something there water is really helpful for me too   its not so easy to just go to sleep if youre experiencing anxiety and youve got physical health issues but if you are having a sleepless night its still beneficial to be resting your body by lying down   also just want to say that if you did have a panic when your students are all there i can guarantee that someone in that class will be struggling with anxiety too and in an odd way would feel less alone if they knew that its actually not an uncommon thing   i really hope your appointment with the gp goes well and they can offer you support  ideally with any underlying physical issues and with your panic attacks glad to hear youve slept a little bit better last night hope that your sleeping keeps improving i get insomnia a lot and understand how being sleep deprived can make your mental health so much worse x i think its really difficult to find a balance  sometimes people genuinely cant face work and trying to have a job causes more problems than it solves  others do find it a distraction and gives them a sense of selfworth  how have you felt about working in the past  i suppose the worst than can happen is that you wont cope and youll have to go back to not working and in that sense you have nothing to lose by trying  however i can completely understand youre dread and anxiety about the situation i cannot cope with working at all and admire you for entertaining the thought  at the end of the day in spite of what the psychiatrist said i think only you know whats best for yourself x hoping it all goes well for you mm and wishing you the best of luck  also hope you have a quick recovery too x im sorry to hear about what happened with your dad  youre right your mothers reaction was understandable because of what had happened but in the nicest possible way it was an overreaction because surgery is pretty safe and the chances of something going wrong are very very small i mean i presume your previous procedure went ok there werent any complications  of course youre nervous i dont think youre a big baby at all its unsettling and the fact that they struggle with the iv means its going to be uncomfortable i relate to this by the way my veins impossible to find blood tests are a nightmare  im sure that those around you will understand you wont be up for cooking and all the preparation with thanksgiving could you delegate and ask for familyfriends to help out i bet theyll be only too pleased to be able to do something for you x thanks for sharing your experiences it can be difficult for people to acknowledge that theres a difference between being shy and suffering with anxiety i have found citalopram helpful for my anxiety too i noticed when i first started taking it that i was more natural and felt more at ease when talking to people i hope things continue to get better for you i can relate too   i think i am naturally an introvert and find too much stimulation stressful even without the mental health issues but its absolutely no fun being lonely and having no friends to call upon on the rare occasion when you do want to go out  i have such a big fear of groups  i hate being in a large group of people because i will inevitably be left out or isolate myself first so that itll seem like its my choice im alone    i think hamletcat is right though it can make a big difference where you socialise and the type of people you spend time with  ive found the most supportive environments to be at places like meditation workshops or art groups hello and welcome to the forum im sorry youve not had any replies yet   ive not been in your position myself but i do know that student services at least in the uk can actually be really good  dont be out off by having to fill out forms  i think these things are just there to please the penpusher types who need to have every box ticked   it may be that they are able to offer you the support you need to complete your degree  whether thats some kind of replacement for the proctor who is leaving or finding an alternative way for you to get what you need without having to go into a busy environment thats going to cause you anxiety hello not sure how long youve been a member here but i havent seen your posts before so welcome    i can really relate to some of what youve said  im 26 and ive never had a job i have a lot of anxiety and i think i do have issues around commitmentfeeling trappedbeing a real adult   but yeah i get all that negative selftalk about being a let down and not being like other people my age    its all crap by the way  you cant possibly compare yourself to anyone  everybody has their own unique mind and each face different obstacles   also success means different things to different people  one person might want a career and a fancy car another might want a loving family and somebody else still will want to travel the world and find inner peace    you are only 18 and i dont mean that in a patronising way i mean how wonderful to be so young   there are people twice your age living with their parents because things arent easy out there in the big wide world at the moment   you must stop putting pressure on yourself to follow this script that everybody else is following because youre not everybody else    i would say that volunteering is a great thing to do even if its only a few hours  i volunteer for 2 hours a week and it really does help shut up that voice that says i am a failure and i get a lot out of it   i suppose the next step would be perhaps to look at a parttime job or maybe a temporary job  that way you arent having to do a full on 95 job   i feel like im waffling a bit so ill leave it here for now im really glad to hear that the anxiety has got better for you though ill be completely honest  i havent found anything to help me bridge the gap between volunteering and paid employment   for me theres a lot more to lose if i try to get a job and fail also with my health it just isnt realistic for me to work at the moment    what has helped me a lot is going out to events and places where i know im going to meet safe people  for instance my volunteering is at an animal rescue centre i know that the people who work and volunteer there are going to be nice and caring people    when i was younger i went to a poetry cafe again people who go to something like that are going to be intelligent and in touch with their feelings also the venue was small the lighting was dim nobody was chitchatting because the main focus was on the person reading their poems    another trick i use is to say to myself that im allowed to leave a place at any time  i think the idea of having to be somewhere for x amount of time used to bother me because just the thought of spending 5 minutes out there in the world was scary enough  so even if you only get as far as walking through the door only to turn around and go back out again that in itself is still a really big achievement   knowing you dont have to be somewhere can help take the pressure off and you might find that you actually want to be there   it really is all about little steps and celebrating those small victories im not on a lot which is unusual for me i did have an appointment with the psychiatrist today but he said he didnt really want to change anything while im having therapy and that i should really give therapy my all not really what i wanted to hear because the therapy is crap but anyway im on citalopram and a low dose of quetiapine i dont think im on enough quetiapine to even have a therapeutic effect but it helps me sleep and just takes the edge off of things x no eventually you will wear yourself out and get some rest  however that can be a long and painful process  my psychiatrist once said to me when i was getting anxiety attacks that they will naturally burn themselves out   you were probably given something like lorazepam possibly even haloperidol in hospital   have you explained to any professional about your anxiety and insomnia it would be good if they could give you some prn meds or something to use when things get really bad x welcome to the forums  i think bullying can have a big impact on people more so than i think is acknowledged   i had a really hard time with being bullied and i think it triggered serious mental health problems in me  whilst youre no longer in that environment i think that the anxiety can continue on into adulthood im 24 and i know that im still in some way affected by the bullying still   just to clarify  have you only been selfharming since taking the citalopram sometimes antidepressants can make people worse and actually give them suicidal thoughts when they didnt have any previously if youre under 25 youre more at risk of these side effects  so its probably worth discussing this with your doctor   im pleased to hear that your compulsions have calmed somewhat though can understand your apprehension about things getting worse again in the winter   hopefully though youll still have the psychologist and doctor to support you if things did get worse x i know precisely what you mean and i agree that i think overthinking plays a huge role in anxiety  with my social anxiety for instance i find that when im in a group of people i dont know that well i am so in my head i feel like theres a part of me that desperately wants to let go and relax but this stupid overthinking part prefers to think what if i make an ass of myself what if what if   sometimes i overthink my body language too that has to be one of the worst situations have you ever done that oh my god its awful i just seem to fixate on where to put my hands does it look weird is it obvious im not comfortable etc   ive heard that changing up your body language in these situations can make a difference to how you feel  a fake it until you make it type thing if you sit or stand with confidence then apparently it helps    overthinking  the number one enemy of the anxious x err well ive seen all kinds of body language analysis having a good posture and not crumpling over apparently having your feet underneath you when sitting on a chair or stool is a sign of nervousness or submission with standing i think its a matter of keeping your head high and maintaining good eye contact  also apparently the more space you take up with your arms and legs the more confident you appear  i always make myself smaller which probably isnt a good thing x is your place carpeted  i dont know what your finances are like but with two dogs my mum insisted on laminate flooring  its much easier to keep the living space feeling cleaner with laminate rather than carpet   as for the sofas my mum often washes the covers too   im sorry encouraging you to clean more is not what i intend to be saying at all x hey  everyone has already given you such good advice that theres not much more i can say  i do wonder if what you are describing is a mild dissociation or depersonalisation  i remember feeling very much as you describe in the past i was a bit of a zombie had a bad headache which seemed to effect my eyesight and i genuinely felt insane as though my concept of reality had gone out of the window  now i know when i feel like that its just me having an episode of derealisation whilst its very scary and unnerving remember that anxiety makes these kind of symptoms much worse  if you are really worried about your health im sure that if you make an appointment to see a doctor they will help you to understand that your physical health is probably not the issue  i mean there are physical things that could be making you feel this way maybe an ear infection or sinus issues  it would be good to rule these things out x believe me the more stressed out you get about this the less likely your period will come to cut the long story short i had an incident where my period didnt come for 10 weeks and worried that i could be pregnant i blacked out and think i had my drink spiked the more i fretted it seemed the longer things took  eventually my period came after i read up on some herbal remedies i would seriously not recommend any herbs unless pregnancy is very very unlikely in my situation not only was i not sure that i was assaulted the forensic nurse made me take the morning after pill and so i was pretty sure that it was just the stress that delayed things anyway certain medications can also affect how effective the pill can be even the progesterone only pill i wonder if perhaps that coming off you meds has essentially made the pill more effective and stopped your bleeding  the reason i say this is because i no longer have periods since taking the progesterone only pill it seems to have stopped things altogether  the main thing i want to say is relax if you still dont start your period in a few days time it may be a good idea to see a nurse or a doctor most overthecounter pregnancy tests are only something like 98 accurate the doctors will be able to give you a blood test  im sorry that this causing you so much stress just try to chill and think of flowing thoughts x i am wondering if its worth your mum going to her own gp and explaining the situation saying that your dad needs a level of care that she is unable to give and to ask for there advice alternatively you could go to citizens advice it may be that social services could have some involvement or that they may be able to suggest some kind of home help particularly if hes had physical issues recently like the strokeheart problems it sounds like a very stressful situation for you and your mum hopefully theres something out there that can help take some of the weight off of you two x it can take a long time to find the right medication sometimes its a combination of more than one medicine that helps i am on citalopram i would not say i am anxietyfree however i do find that in some situations i am more confident when taking my medication i am unsure why a psychiatrist would say that an antidepressant could leave you anxiety free because i think thats a bit unrealistic particularly if the problem lies in your thought pattern because then its your thoughts you need to work on in therapy im glad youve found a more suitable psychiatrist for you and i hope that you dont have to keep trying all kinds of medication and feel better soon x welcome to the forum  yes i have experienced the same sort of thing im glad you went to the hospital and they didnt find anything physically wrong  are you on any medication at all at the moment i have experienced heart palpitations due to mental health medications x welcome to the forums   i think its quite common amongst people who suffer from anxiety to get anxious over health matters its something i know that i do a lot  i am pleased that you went to your doctors and had various checks and that they have confirmed you are in good health   unfortunately i dont have much advice with the sleep thing because you are very much describing the situation im in its been going on for years  i totally relate to your frustration with it all similar to you ive tried many things not allowing myself to over sleep allowing myself to sleep when i need and it seems that no matter what i do i always get tired  personally i think i suffer with chronic fatigue or possibly fibromyalgia but i think its very difficult to get a gp to diagnose that anyway but probably even harder if mental health issues are there   one thing i would say though is that its definitely worth seeing your doctor and asking them to run blood tests if thats not something they have already done there may be an issue with anaemia lack of vitamins thyroid problems etc and that needs to be ruled out  do you drink enough water i know that i sometimes feel better when i make an effort to up my water intake   this is just my own opinion not scientifically proven but i think that when i sleep a lot im obviously not having any fluid intake and so i wake up with a dry mouth and a bad headache the headache leads to lethargy and so the cycle continues  its definitely not a cure but it might help with energy levels   there are meds that you could be prescribed for sleep some are short term only but there are things that can help in the longer term   im really sorry youre struggling with this anyway i know how it feels and its bloody miserable  it really does stop you from living a normal life and engaging in meaningful activities  x i had a bit of a crash course in this type of thing as a child i was really scared of dogs if i saw one in the distance id freak out and cry  then through lots of persuasion our family got a puppy i could just about tolerate a pup theyre not that scary anywho through exposure to our dog and subsequently other dogs when i went for walkies i am now a dog lover   it does work just dont ask me to do the same with spiders  x because im on the first floor i can keep my windows open and not worry about anybody looking in so really my windows never get closed  the downside to that is i dont have a clue who or what people are talking about when i hear them outside  ive often heard phrases or names ie bitch  shes taking the piss etc and got worried that i was being talked about  i think youve just got to think logically and assure yourself that its highly unlikely that you are being talked about xx have you spoke to the doctorsdentist about this  i grind my teeth sometimes at night but if someone has heard you from downstairs  then its obviously quite a severe problem for you   which shield did you try the diy ones you get over the counter or a proper fitted one from the dentist   it sounds a bit daft but i wonder if chewing gum might help at least then youll have something between your teeth and it wont be as damaging x i really dont think there is a right or wrong way of dealing with this  i agree that i think youre doing the best you can  you could always ask your mum it sounds as if you and her can talk openly about what shes going through what approach she would find most helpful   i dont think theres a risk of enabling her   to be honest some people would find a tough approach very unhelpful and may even find it hurtful  also as shes been willing to go to the cbt and understands that she has issues i dont think you run the risk of enabling her because shes aware of her situation x welcome to the forums are you getting any professional input at the moment or is this something youre dealing with on your own i understand what you mean about being overwhelmed by anxiety and feeling that its completely taking over you mention it happens whenever you dont feel in control of a situation  are there particular examples you can think of the only reason i ask is that it can be helpful to try and find the root of anxiety x can you send an email or a text instead  i can really relate to this i despise phone calls it seems illogical doesnt it because with a phone call you have the advantage that you can just hang up if you dont like whats going on  you cant do that facetoface  for me i think the lack of visual cues like body language and facial expression is what makes me really anxious i dont like not being able to read people and i dont like people being unable to read me x this is just a random suggestion but you can get those wristbands that use acupressure to relieve nausea theyre sold for morning or travel sickness but it has helped me a bit with the nausea i get from anxiety x oh bums i wish you luck just remember if it all goes pear shaped you can just hang up and try again  x aww im really sorry youre feeling so bad has something in particular happened or are you just feeling a bit crap   please try and stay away from thoughts of ending it all    are you due to see any professional some time soon i know meds arent always the answer but im just wondering if something can be tweaked to help you feel calmer   sorry if ive misinterpreted what youve said but are you not sleeping well at the moment that can have a really bad effect on the way you feel i know that when im tired i get far more startled by noises than normal sometimes just the door buzzer is enough to give me a panic attack   sleeping with ear plugs really helps me in that sense   have you tried mediation or just listening to calming sounds ive read somewhere that listening to nature noises really helps lower stress its something that ive found useful in unwinding x as annoying as mums can be with putting a damper on things they are only thinking of the practicalities because they have your best interest at heart  it can be annoying and im sure that wanting to go ahead to prove her wrong is a response people can relate to however it is an emotional reaction and i think you need to think about this rationally   how long is it until you are due to go i am wondering if seeing a doctor before you go and explaining about your panicanxiety attacks is worth a go  they may be able to give you some advice or even medication to help   if it were me i would stay and cancel the trip australia is a long way from home having said that im not you and so am only answering from what i would do if i were in your position   you havent mentioned how old you are but im guessing your young enough that you could always do the aupairing in the future   having said all of that it may be something you can break through  i remember having a bit of an episode when i went on holiday with a friend i was so pissed offanxiousdepressed that i just wanted to come home  eventually i got over my wobble and made it through to the end of the holiday it was difficult but i did it   im sorry this is all conflicting and is probably not giving you much of a clear answer either way but then it ultimately is your choice x sorry to hear the anxietys almost through the roof  sending some steady calming vibes   hopefully with the diagnosis you might get some better help  i feel my anxiety is always overlooked because its not my main diagnosis hopefully you wont have that problem now x can you access psychotherapy with a trained psychotherapist  its not easy to try techniques out yourself sometimes you need the help of another person to guide you through the tough times has your psychiatrist prescribed you medication for depression you must talk to them if you think the medication isnt helping in some cases antidepressants can cause people to feel worse and have suicidal thoughts if thats whats happening for you then you need to try another medication x wait for your blood results it could indeed be a blood sugar issue but because your body remembers what the anxiety feels like your brain is getting tricked  if there is no physical explanation for it then it does sound like you could be having some kind of panic attacks especially if they are so out of the blue is there anything going on in the bigger picture of your life thats causing you stress  for your own sake it might be an idea to keep a diary too sometimes i feel really awful for what seems like no reason at all and its not until i reflect upon things that i realise something really subtle happened that actually could have served as a trigger it would be good to identify a trigger for whats going on wouldnt it that way youre better equipped to understand whats going on and to do something about it x it could be possible my understanding is that anxiety attacks come on when there is an identifiable reason say for instance youve got a fear of public speaking and youre about to give a presentation panic attacks are very out of the blue you can be sitting down minding your own business and all of a sudden a wave comes crashing over you  apologies if this is something you already know  its just something thats helped me better understand my own issues better  x oh god really free floating anxiety sounds as fun as it probably is to experience  x have you told your therapist about this  it sounds like you need to sort out the feelings that are causing you to feel upsetunhappy the eating to calm down is just a coping mechanism for something else going on underneath i dont think your problem with eating will get better until you feel better  obviously its your decision about medication and if you can cope without them then thats really positive but personally ive found them very helpful i know there are side effects but for me the side effects are better than feeling unwell  im sure daily yoga would help if you can bring yourself to do it  do you drink much water sometimes i find that when ive had enough fluids then im not as hungry   anyway as ive said i do think you should mention this to your therapist if you havent already and explain how much its affecting you  i would also say that having therapy isnt always easy and can bring up painful memories and so this might be another thing causing you to feel sad x blueflames is right you probably would benefit from some counselling   though i see from your post that youre not doing so well financially as you said you didnt have money from being treated for allergies i presume youre somewhere where healthcare isnt free   im sorry life is being so challenging for you at the moment    do you have anybody around who can help you on a more practical level   not sure what your allergies are but if you can sort out your living environment so that triggers are eliminated that would be great am wondering if anybody is there to help you do that x dont really know what advice to give but just want to say i can really relate to what youre saying i suppose it depends on what the opinion is actually about for me there are things that i can let go of eg if someones slagged of a film i like but i must admit ive got myself really distressed and angry at some things ive read online particularly when theres a generalisation going on  if i wanted to i could probably destroy my faith in humanity within 2 minutes by reading certain things you have to remember though that its only really one individual expressing a view even if lots of people agree with them there will always be other people who dont agree and may well be as outraged as you are about certain things being said  i could go off on a bit of a rant but i dont want to bore you and also youve not really given much information on what sorts of things are upsetting you and so i may be getting the wrong end of the stick  but i suppose the only thing thats helped me is to avoid looking at things that i know are going to trigger me in some way fair enough things pop up where you dont expect them sometimes but usually you can see a title of a threadarticepost that you just know is going to piss you off its good to avoid those x you must ask your doctor this  in the nicest possible way i have no idea what all these words mean   plus as nobody here is a professional i dont think anybody can say for sure whether its safe or not so yeah better be safe than sorry and ask your doctor  welcome to the forum by the way x i dont know if its possible to necessarily reverse that overanalytical voice but from my own personal experience there are times when i find its not allconsuming i can very much relate to what you say about overanalysing to the point where you no longer know what to say i think for me nothing really seems important enough to say out loud  but then a lot of whats said is not really important people talk a lot of rubbish to be honest but taking part in some chitchat at least is a part of life though of course people naturally are introverts  i think maybe getting an awareness of thinking distortions you can google the term and find explanations and examples is one thing thats helped me i know when im catastrophising and assuming the worst is happening or when im mind reading and thinking that i know what people think of me to just be aware that thats distorted thinking sometimes is enough  it sounds like you spent a long time just not being able to relax or to be you i dont know what the army is like an so i dont want to make a judgement and present it as a fact but i get the impression that youre name personality and life story arent seen as important my impression is that they dont really care who you are as an individual and that you are taught to be both cut off and on alert simultaneously i could be very wrong though  one thing that has helped me is antidepressant medication i do find then numbing but in some ways it can be helpful for that anxiety because i find it loosens the grip that it has on me and enables me to be more of an observer  of course ultimately what is going to help is gently reintroducing yourself to the world getting out there start small it might only be a onceaweek class or something but its a vicious circle when youre a bit trapped inside i know from experience  x i know this is a bit of a cliche but you have to remember that everybody is nervous when they take their driving test the examiner will appreciate that fact have you tried bach flower rescue remedy for me its quite effective take the pastels rather than the drops to be on the safe side the drops have a very tiny amount of alcohol in but just to be on the safe side what i mean is it wont affect your driving but it does have a slight smell of brandy probably not good if someone smells it on you   also as ng said get in as much practise as you can   another thing is even if you make a mistake and think thats it ive failed dont get disheartened youre allowed 15 minor faults i stalled at the traffic lights on the way back to my local test centre and got really disheartened thinking id messed up almost started crying there and then turns out because i checked my mirrors and handled the situation in a safe manner i passed  good luck with it positive thinking eh x i dont know what mentally healthy people do though i think youre on to something  im convinced that they dont spend much time selfreflecting or analysing themselves  though im not sure how easy it is to practise looking outwards if it doesnt come naturally to you dont know if it is something you can just do permanently and make everything go away i know that distraction helps a lot so in that sense looking outward is a good thing to do sorry im being a bit vague and not being much help just wanted to say that i agree with your observation and what youve said is food for thought x i would say its some kind of dissociative state  though cant diagnose you obviously   i agree with the suggestion of speaking to a doctor if this is bothering you theyll know the right questions to as you and might be able to help get to the bottom of whats wrong and whats causing you to feel that way x yeah dont go on a bender    seriously though im glad the doctor was a decent person and treated you with respect  wishing you the best of luck with your trial hopefully it can finally be over you dont need to feel bad about only posting on here when youre feeling upset    thats really frustrating about your work hours i can completely understand how disappointed and let down you must be feeling sometimes it only takes one thing to have a domino effect and eventually you can get really down i cant see why they werent able to give you the extra hours you wanted but there   im not trying to pry but how does losing out on housing benefit and having your council tax affect you financially will you be able to cope im wondering if there is any more support that might be available to you though i dont really know how the situation is for people who dont have full time hours   anyway as your title says youve never felt this bad before im wondering if youre having a depressive period are you getting any help for mental health issues xx unfortunately theres not much else that you can do as youve said because you already apologised to the girl and shes accepted that its a tricky situation in that you dont know how she really felt about it all id imagine that youll probably not find out how she felt either the thing is it sounds like you didnt go too far with things and stopped before anything got out of hand alcohol is really not good in terms of how it can make you less aware of the consequences of your actions so keep that in mind there is a risk that by focusing on it too much you may end up making it a bigger deal than it is and youll only be torturing yourself in the process my feeling is that perhaps youve over analysing things way too much and youre taking this one incident very badly  to the point where youre questioning yourself you said youve always cared about other peoples feelings nobody is perfect youve misjudged a situation and apologised for what happened  dont beat yourself up over this youre still a caring person this doesnt change who you are  everybody makes mistakes especially after drinking  unless you hear anything else try not to fret too much about it x i dont think its too much to ask and im sorry youve not had a reply yet  im in a similar situation myself really  im very isolated and have no friends that i can really spend time with i also have weight issues probably due to lack of exercise but i mainly comfort eat because i feel so alone  have you got any support in terms of mental health services are there any places that run activities for people with mh issues in your area like mind or rethink i think that is something thats really lacking in society  peer support  also im not sure if youve checked to see on the local forums section whether or not there are services in your area mentioned that might be worth exploring  i would say its all about little steps and if you find yourself feeling particularly good one day make yourself go out even if its for a short walk down the road   other than that ive found certain activities like meditation classes or artcraft courses tend to draw in people who are generally quite supportive and the environment has been really safe for an anxious person like me im sorry youve not had a response yet  have things got any better  it does sound to me like you might have a problem with agoraphobia i say agoraphobia but obviously i dont know if you fear open spaces or if its generally more of a sense of being scared of people or something bad happening   if youre housebound and this has been going on for months i think you should contact your gp and have a telephone conversation with them because it doesnt seem likely that you would be able to attend an appointment  its one thing to be content to be indoors but its different if you find yourself wanting to go out but not being able to how did things go for you today ive never been diagnosed with agoraphobia but have had and still have to some extent social phobia which prevented me from going out big time  id say to you to start small little steps literally do you have a garden where you live maybe spending time in the garden would help  am wondering also if you live alone and if you or whoever you live with has a car do you still have issues with being out even if youre in a vehicle i think perhaps aiming to go to your grandmothers is a good idea how will you get to her house  i can see how youre in between a rock and a hard place to stay in will drive you potty but going out is obviously a huge challenge for you  i would encourage you to try to go to quiet places first as a means of getting more confident with going out perhaps going for a walk in nature  i dont know if you like animals or if theres a dog rescue centre near you but places like that are always looking for volunteer dog walkers whats nice about that is you have some form of company in the way of a dog but its nothing too overwhelming perhaps thats there to think about in the future  does your gp know you have these issues by the way thats fair enough conventional psychiatric help doesnt always help people live more fulfilling lives   i can see how you want to chuck yourself in at the deep end because youre feeling desperate as i said this trip to see your grandmother sounds like a good place to start is the train journey long do you have anything you can take with you like a book or crossword to hopefully keep you occupied yeah there is a stereotype of an agoraphobic isnt there  i think in reality the condition varies  as with other mental health issues no two sufferers are exactly the same   im not sure what to suggest really i struggle with anxiety when im out and about dont like meeting new people hate crowds dont like being in groups i fear im in the way etc   so yeah while i know what its like to have certain struggles im not quite sure if i have any words of wisdom  just wanted to say im sorry that youre having these issues   it really does have a huge impact on your quality of life i do think its a good suggestion to perhaps try to seek out friendships where you can do the things you enjoy without putting any pressure on your relationship   has your partner ever sought any professional help  it must be difficult anyway but perhaps even more so if hes not currently working through his issues with the right support   also im wondering if there are places that he feels safe to go to not sure if you or him drives but do you think somewhere quiet and peaceful like a local woodland would be somewhere hed be willing to go to  i think with any kind of mental health issue its about taking little steps towards recovery and so even if 5 minutes in a peaceful place is all he can manage then thats a good start want to welcome you to the forum whilst this is no substitute for real life this forum has helped me a great deal were a very friendly bunch so do stick around if you feel like it welcome to the forums    i dont have much else to add really to what gajolenes already said  its worth trying the sertraline but go back to the gp straight away if you find that you feel worse when taking them  ssri antidepressants and some other medications can actually make people feel more suicidal and under 25s are at a higher risk of this happening  am not trying to say this to alarm you by the way just think its good to know just in case you do find yourself feeling lower   i really hope that you find they work for you anxiety and panic attacks are really horrible to deal with welcome to the forum   im really sorry to hear that your dad was unsupportive some people just dont understand mental health very well at all im sure youd much rather a normal life  its not like youre having this anxiety because its fun   im glad that you had a friends place to stay at though i think taking bagpuss advice and contacting your local council would be wise   how long have you been on the sertraline it can take a while to kick in or it may be that other meds are more suited or that youre more a candidate for therapy  its early days either way so please dont lose faith just wanted to post a get well soon message here wishing you a quick recovery thinking of you ive only just seen this  i hope youre ok hunny and im sorry that youve had to deal with yet more shit from him i really hope you refrained from any si because you dont deserve to be punished at all   im really sorry to hear about your experience i think id have been really upset and frightened too  i think a lot of people are so quick to lose their temper but as you said it was an honest mistake on your part its not as if you got your car stuck for the fun of it   i know its easier said than done but please dont take what the guy said on board   his outburst wasnt personal because he doesnt know you   anybody could have been in your position and i expect he would have had a temper tantrum at them oh it says in the first post march anyway that really sucks what a complete farce eh and im not too bad thanks for asking i dont have a panic attack disorder but do get panic attacks occasionally when things are bad   how do i deal with them here are my tips   put your hands on a flat surface if there is a table or counter you can lean on thats good sometimes putting your hands flat on a wall can help too its good to feel physically stable  if you are scared you might pass out sit down they recommend putting your head between your legs in a sitting position im a bit too fleshy and not flexible enough for that personally so cant say if it helps or not because ive not tried it   affirmations its ok usually i cant cope with any longwinded affirmation when im in the thick of it but just telling yourself its ok its alright can be quite comforting remind yourself that it will pass   breathing proper big breaths like imagine youre blowing up a balloon i find puckering my lips like im blowing up a balloon helps too you might look a pillock but it is helpful    when you start to feel a bit less wobbly just take some small steps to get back in your body take it easy   go and get a glass of water  if youre prescribed prn meds take one of those if they help and youre allowed to do that   have a bloody good cry about it too its ok  x presuming youre in the uk your first port of call for this would be a gp i dont know if youd be too anxious to make an appointment but it could be worth it if it means you get some support  do you think the reason youre so anxious about work related stuff is because of the unemployment id say its natural to some extent to be anxious about searching for work its an emotionally draining process i think but if the anxiety and low mood are preventing you from taking opportunities andor affecting your quality of life id say its definitely worth you speaking to your gp this is basically what i was getting at in my reply to another thread of yours i dont know how open minded you are to alternative therapies but i do think theres more help out there in the holistic healing field than on the nhs having said that there are people who have mentioned they are having some kind of trauma therapy so it may just depend on the area you live in  my understanding of the way forward with this is to take a body  mind approach to healing in lots of different ideasphilosophies emotional pain and trauma stores itself in the physical body basically you have to access where its stored inside of you to enable you to explore and release the anxiety and trauma it is a long process but im sure you understand that things wont change overnight  ive had different soul healings shamanic that have helped me far more than any medications reiki is also good also ive heard good things emdr eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing from what i know of it they make you move your eyes around until you find that you are looking in a direction which makes whatever youre trying to work on feel the most accessible the therapist then talks you through and helps you desensitise to the triggermemory  i think its trial and error but you can eventually find something that helps  x i suppose the brain hasnt really evolved much i dont know i think the brain can get to the point where any stimulus stimuli is seen as a threat  im sure ive read somewhere that physiologically excitement and fear are not that different its just the accompanying thoughts that make one more pleasurable than the other so i think being happyactive can be interpreted as unhelpful nervous energy hence the shutting down x ohh ive just discovered this thread  im not an agoraphobic and luckily my panic attacks are very scarce but nonetheless i do get quite high anxiety  my balance is shite    also ive read that oestrogen levels affect balance and coordination i take the pill so dont get periods any more but when i used to i used to get so clumsy and was even more poor at parking than usual ahem when i was premenstrual i also used to feel even more stressed and anxious than usual at the thought of being out anywhere even if it was to the local shop  wonder if its linked   sorry i cant really add anything or give any helpful links just wanted to say thanks to you and monkee for the posts its an interesting idea x  wishing you the best possible outcome sometimes medication can cause blurred eyesight im on citalopram and i find thats made my vision worse  also as im sure you know crying will cause swelling in your eyes and blood vessels and so that will also make your vision cloudy  as youve been to the doctorsopticians etc i do think that your eyesight problems are maybe more anxiety related   oh and the floating specs are called sometimes known as floaters and theyre basically dead cells floating around the surface of your eyes  not nice but not harmful either welcome to the forum   really sorry to hear youve had a bad time of it were here if you want to talk more about it attacks are different every time sometimes you dont always get the same symptoms and it can be more subtle but obviously noticeable ive been told the difference between an anxiety attack and a panic attack is that an anxiety attack happens for a good reason eg youve got social anxiety and youre asked to read something out in front of other people whereas a panic attack is out of the blue and for no logical reason at all so it does sound like youre getting panic attacks even if sometimes theyre not totally debilitating its hard whether someones dealing with anxiety or panic but panic is more difficult in the sense that if you dont know whats triggering you its not so easy to help yourself avoid getting an attack  i understand youre apprehensive but its great that youre seeing your doctor to be honest they might not just write out a prescription usually they make more suggestions on selfhelp whether its relaxation techniques or a cbt type course or ive even had my doctor suggest a good book to read let us know how it goes and yes it can lessen and become controllable its just early days for you at the moment youll get there i also experience this it might be worth seeing your doctor especially if youre particularly at risk of sleep apnoea  i would say though that its more than likely mental health related being particularly anxious or stressed out can make this gasp thing happen  if its really bothering you try to do what you can to make your sleeping environment better make sure the space is calm and free of clutter and electricals i know its winter but also ive found having a fan next to my bed helps me breathe better no but only because i didnt need to most places are pretty good with customer services and wont even ask for an explanation i mean this in the nicest possible way but i think you might be overthinking i know i do it myself  its easy to get caught up thinking what if they ask why im returning this item and trying to get an excuse prepared but ive never had anybody at customer services ask why im returning an item theyre more than likely just wanting to help the customers always right so they say bumping this thread in hopes that someone may be able to give a more detailed answer its not something i know much about have you asked her what you could do to help make her feel better im sure regular contact with help obviously but it may be that shell have some ideas of how you can help once shes a bit calmer and more accepting of your decision to go are you on any meds for anxiety quite a lot of psych medication can cause the thicksticky salivia or a really dry mouth also are you drinking enough  and youve come to the right place if you need a friend ok so what is it about public transport that you dont like im assuming its the social side rather than the fear of getting in an accident or whatever just remind yourself of what you have achieved in the past it sounds like you managed to get yourself feeling better off your own back without anybodys help do you know what the root cause of this anxiety is were you bullied or anything or just a shy kid if you can identify some of the reasons behind your feelings it would give you something to work on yeah i really relate to what everybodys saying here  my avoidance behaviour is really bad   i used to only get petrol at the 24hour garage early in the morning about 2am after some chavs in a car shouted fatty really loud over the forecourt and totally humiliated me it wasnt until i got the same guy serving me every time i went and he kept wanting to have a proper conversation with me that i went back to going to the garage at a more sensible time  i go to the supermarket at night too and sometimes go to the one in the next town over i remember driving 15 minutes to a coop in the next town to avoid having to go to the one on my high street  its crazy really   oh and who else waits til theres no sign of any neighbours around before leaving the house bet its not just me x welcome to the forum  dont really know about the thing with the blankets do people who sleep walk have awareness of what theyre doing ive never really understood sleepwalking  sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between dreams and reality i find even more so if youre generally quite stressed  sorry to hear about your panic attacks theyre really unpleasant anyway but much more difficult to calm yourself when youre in public x i think its natural for you to want to cry  leaving school and moving out are two both very significant events in life and both very bittersweet  its bound to give you anxiety i mean have you ever lived away from home before  are you living alone in your new place   go easy on yourself being emotional in your circumstances are quite a common experience    sorry if ive missed anything but do you have a mental health diagnosis if i were you id keep an eye on yourself particularly if these feelings dont ease off after a while   jonwal is right also in that this is potentially a great opportunity its a testing time when youre first independent but it can be very rewarding too x i dont have kids so dont really know the ins and outs of this sort of thing but it definitely sounds like asking the community nurse for some guidance would be a good thing im surprised you havent already been offered some help with it how are people meant to know what to write hope you can tackle this soon and get it out of the way so its one less thing to stress about x welcome to the forum  it sounds like your sister is in a lot of distress and has been for a while now i can understand how that must be having an impact on the whole family particularly your older parents who are finding themselves in a position of having to care for her  as toastedcrumpet said its still very early days  the fact that she is engaging with mental health services is a really good sign and hopefully staff will make note of her behaviour and hopefully she will get some help   are you in the uk i know that whenever ive been in a mental health unit there has been an opportunity for a meeting with family along with professionals  i think it would be really good if you could have the chance to talk to somebody perhaps at the unit shes staying in and express your concerns   it sounds like she needs some support to live an independent life and shes not getting it    i really hope that this is the start of her recovery x ah thats a really great thing to do  unfortunately i dont have a garden and so dont really have a safe space for a fire  but ive done it at different ceremonies outside sometimes ive even been extra careful and burned a piece of paper with things i want to let go of written on with a candle x there has been research to show that facebook actually makes people feel more depressed  you have to understand that what you see posted is only a carefully chosen segment of someones life people dont generally tend to share the details of how boringsadunfulfilling their lives are on there it is an illusion and you have to be clever about these things and see past it all   when you use facebook how do you access it is it on your laptop or a phone or both  one thing that has helped me is no longer having it set as a favourite website i also log out after browsing which means that i have to sign in every time i want to use it  this all helps me use it more consciously   i think doing something like that could help i can imagine having no account at all would be too difficult and in this day and age it seems that there is a feeling that youre missing out if you dont have it  but if you can use it more mindfully  perhaps limit accessing it through your laptop only doing what i do by signing out after every session and interrupting that part that is fooled by how wonderful other peoples lives seem to be   i dont think youre too old to change or to have a satisfying life i dont think its ever too late for anyone to make positive changes  sometimes youve just got to start with small things   do you have much of a social life what kind of things do you like to do  perhaps you could see what groups and activities there are in your local area ive found that even if its just something on for one afternoon a week getting out and having that to look forward to can really help   it probably feels a bit rubbish and overwhelming at the moment but i do think its positive that youve identified your life just isnt working for you hopefully you can be empowered now to take control and start thinking about what changes youd like to see and how you can go about making those changes is small manageable steps x as maya j said its definitely not too late to do things differently youve done so well from the sounds of things i know you might not feel like it but to juggle all of the things that you do must be really hard work and the fact that you have more ambition still is a credit to you i can see how the fact that you dropped college to be in a job where youre having issues with colleagues must be really frustrating id be pretty pissed off but anyway its not too late to make a plan of action x oh thats not nice i experience something similar  have you spoken to a doctor about it i think its important to rule out anything else like fibromyalgia or some other underlying physical issue personally i just try to get by the best i can but if it gets too much i take painkillers obviously its not a good idea to have them too often but if theres something you need to be doing but dont feel able to due to the pain then it doesnt hurt to take some painkillers  im sorry i dont really have much advice i just experience the same thing so can sympathise x first of all welcome to the forum   it does sound perhaps like a bit of an anxiety thing i think youre on to something though when you say that your intelligence is something that you value highly and in your own words you feel without it you would have nothing and so because its so important to you it sounds almost as if youre rigorously checking to see if youve still got it just my own thoughts but i do wonder if this is a reflection of not such great selfesteem in other areas i mean do you feel you feel you have other good qualities  im 24 and feel the same way our generation is odd isnt it  though i dont have a physical disability i had admissions for my mental health and got home tuition from the age of 13 onwards i didnt have a social life and still dont really i sporadically see the few friends i do have and so i can relate to your situation in some ways  personally i feel missing out on those normal teen experiences has had a detrimental effect on me in terms of my social skills i have the loneroutsider complex and cant do small talk i wish i could do small talk but i just genuinely dont know what to say   if i were you i would mention this to the psychologist youre seeing while the appointment may be initially to explore the possibility of add i think that the psychologist should help you with this and give you some more insight into it x i hear what youre saying but do you think it might be easier with a trained advocate whos obviously professional and you dont have to worry about upsetting the issue of cyclothymia does need to be raised and you need to know what they are doing to help you i wouldnt advise lying but i do think you should lay it on pretty thick to the doctor and explain just how much your moods are affecting you   are you due to see a psychiatrist soon at all do you have any upcoming appointments x i dont know how much research has been done on it ive read that its not a good idea to mix antidepressants and st johns wart  but never really heard much about rhodiola roseas effects  if i were you id ask the doctor im sure it would be safe but its better to get some medical advice first x what time of day are you taking it x ive done something a bit similar before only i was having suicidal thoughts and i told the staff that was what i was feeling so i was there all night from about 1030pm until my mum picked me up the next morning i waiting for a psychiatrist to see me and that happened at around 4am   i dont know im sure you would be asked by staff after a while what you were doing there after a couple of hours if they hadnt already clicked theyd see that you were on your own not waiting for someone   sorry i cant be more helpful lol i think if they knew or felt you were feeling vulnerable theyd let you be xx i dont know if its normal or not but if its causing you distress then something needs to be done to help you i saw on your other thread that you said you have had meds and counselling  are you getting anything like that at the moment you should go to your gp and explain how youre feeling im sure what youre experiencing is bad enough and so i think that the getting support you need soon will prevent you from feeling a lot worse x have you done anything that might upset him or might warrent him being on the lookout for you im just wondering im not trying to belittle what youre saying but obviously i dont know what youre mental health issues are or if youre prone to paranoid thoughts it may be that hes barely even thinking about you if its been a few weeks i can imagine its not a nice situation to be in though  theres someone in my town im scared of bumping into not because im scared that theyll hurt me its just we had a big falling out and its bound to be awkward but its been 10 months and ive not seen them even once hopefully next week you can talk to the doctor about how youre feeling and they might be of some help to you x hey i know some of the dates here are referring to august as its now october are things still pretty much the same for you it seems things arewere really getting intolerable for you are you on any meds or are you seeing any professionals what sounds really tricky is that from what youve said theres no identifiable trigger to your anxiety its as if its more part of who you are than an illness thats come about as a result of something do you keep a diary at all maybe it might be useful to you to see if you can identify what sets the episodes off it could be something really subtle but writing down what you did at the end of each day might help im not going to be irritating and say you should cut down on the drinking im sure its something you already know eating food quickly can be an issue particularly if youre not chewing the food enough the larger the bits of food going into your stomach are the more acid it has to produce in order for it to break down that can cause stomach upset im very guilty of skipping breakfast myself so cant really say much but it is important even if its just a cup of tea and the breakfast biscuits you can buy some of them are quite tasty it kick starts your metabolism in the morning  drinking water is really important especially if you do drink alcohol because thatll help flush toxins out have you tried milk thistle capsulestea thats also really good for a bit of detox also i know that having excess saliva is a sign youre about to be sick so by having a dry mouth its sounds very much more of a panicanxiety thing than a medical im sorry youre experiencing it though it sounds crappy have you ever had any therapy cbt in particular it might be worth contacting whoever is responsible for your care ie your gp or mental health team and asking for a referral its like youve almost got a preoccupationbit of a phobia developing though im no expert good luck and hope things improve soon hey ive not read any of your previous posts so not sure about whats been going on for you but im really sorry to hear things are really crappy at the moment sending you lots of love do you have anybody professional family friends that are looking after you at home unfortunately emotional things wont go away overnight but im just checking that youre physical needs are being seen to especially if you cant leave the house much at the moment do you have enough food etc first of all welcome to the forum   it sounds like youve had really horrible experiences in your life and im truly sorry to hear that  for whatever reasons it sounds like your parents and aunt were incapable of giving you the support and love that you needed and understandably it affected your selfesteem which in turn made building friendships really hard  i have to say that from what youve written you are incredibly insightful and intelligent when it comes to putting the pieces of your story together and identifying how things have affected you thats a really big advantage when it comes to making some changes  have you had any counselling or therapy at all it can be difficult to go over painful experiences but ultimately it can also be really helpful  i do think that you could do with some help with processing your past and looking forward to how you want your future to be hopefully they can help you take small steps towards changing things when the time is right and youre ready  of course seeing a counsellor or therapist involves putting some trust into someone but its a safe environment so its a good place to start something like this will take time but maybe now youre getting to the point where the pain of the loneliness is greater than the fear of people  finally just want to say youre not an outcast at all and by all means stick around the forum  there are lots of us here who find it difficult to get out and have a normal social life hi its not something i suffer with but 48 years is a long time for you to deal with this on your own so i really hope that you can get some help soon  do you know what the reasons are behind this is it being selfconscious of not thinking youre good enough a fear of picking up on germs or generally feeling uncomfortable with anybodys anatomy  i wonder if its been difficult to get help with because its not quite clear what exactly it is about it that makes you so anxious spiders i usually kill the bastards as soon as i see them problem solved  x you definitely would benefit from counselling from the sounds of things  why are you being pushed down the waiting list  who has referred you i would go back to whoever has referred you and explain just exactly what an big impact this problem is having on your life its not good enough to keep you waiting  i wouldnt go as far as saying im phobic of men but i have definitely had major anxiety issues im by no means free of it even now but i have come a long way from how i was several years ago  i think whats helped me is spending time around men in a mixed safe environment and just spending time in nonthreatening situations  if youve got a lot of bad experiencesmemories around men then you need to create experiences that are more neutral so that eventually you have more scenarios where things were ok to draw on hope that makes sense  i found going to a pottery group has helped a lot it was mainly women but the men that were there were much older and were totally nonthreatening and because the course was practical there was no pressure to have conversation it was just a case of being and making things in a calm environment   i do think im going on a bit now so ill stop here  i would suggest making some noise about the counselling to the right person and when youre ready just gently start putting yourself in situations that expose you to men but situations that are safe and that you can get out of if youre uncomfortable x i suppose people may see a car accident as unlikely to happen to them although the danger is greater there is a lower chance of something bad happening whilst the fear of embarrassing or humiliating yourself in front of a teacher or pretty girl could be quite high  i dont know those are just my thoughts i can really relate to this ive never worked and cant ever imagine myself settling into a job i just cant i think i have similar feelings to you with regards to the social anxiety and paranoia  if i try to imagine being in work i see myself having panic attacks andor selfharming in toilet cubicles like i used to in secondary school before i got the home tuition omg yes i remember on a caravan holiday i went on with the fam when i was around 5 or 6 it was in the south of france and a hornet came into our caravan  i remember being absolutely stunned at the size of it it was almost like i was so mesmerised by the sight of it i forgot to be scared    i used to freak out about wasps a lot then i got stung a couple of years ago and it was much less painful than i remembered it to be when i was stung as a child so they dont bother me as much  i do have bug killer spray i know its not very nice but i do kill them if theyre not rescueable  for some reason ive always been alright with bees i think because i was told they die when they sting ive got the impression theyre more reluctant to sting you plus they just seem a bit slower a dopier than wasps x hi juhls  as you can see this thread is a few years old  most members who have posted here are no longer active members  have you tried some of the things mentioned here such as exposing yourself to your fear perhaps by ice skating  i can understand where this might come from i am very unstable on my feet anyway and have a fear of slipping over    am sorry that i cant be more helpful hopefully as this thread has been bumped some other people here might be able to give you bettermore specific advice i agree i mean would they really be missed   oh and im sorry about your 8leg experience crumpet now they truly are evil little creatures x stress can manifest itself in lots of physical ways i find i have issues with eyesight too i am shortsighted to a point and have astigmatism so my vision isnt great anyway but when things are bad my eyes can be problematic  are you sleeping enough obviously tiredness can be a cause of this sort of thing  you can get products that help like eye drops to help these kinds of eye problems ive even seen recently that you can get a spray that you apply when your eyes are closed if youre someone that finds applying eye drops difficult sometimes putting cold cucumber slices over your eyes for a few minutes can provide a bit of relief but just a bit of warning from my own experience the cucumber slices have made my eyes water too much and ive found it makes my vision worse temporarily x i dont have much in the way of advice but im in a similar position to you im very isolated and have been for a long time youre right its very hard to get out of this position social anxiety is different from general anxiety although it can be hard to know whats what   for the past few years ive been on citalopram and its helped my social anxiety a huge amount i would say that now im just anxious rather than socially anxious if that makes any sense   in the past when ive had social anxiety the symptoms for me would be very physical  whenever i had to be around people or talk to someone id get all of the classic signs of anxiety shaking dry mouth rapid heart beat cant breathe i would feel completely paralysed  i completely avoided all eye contact and would blush if i had to talk id have to hide my hands because theyd be shaking   i also never said anything because not only was i afraid id say something stupid id also be so wrapped up in my anxious thoughts that id miss what people were saying to me  i just couldnt stop thinking that i was going to embarrass myself    although i still now have anxiety and get anxious around people i can give eye contact and have a conversation if i have to i wouldnt be able to do that before yes  ive been in a group who were having a laugh and i really wanted to join in but its like hitting a wall i totally get it   as i said it was taking the citalopram that helped me if i stopped taking it which i did for a brief period a few years ago i notice the difference straight away so its not really cured as such its just better managed with medication its early days with the medication you might find it really helpful although its not a miracle cure how long have you been with your therapist  have you tried breathing exercised andor meditation its a bit of a cliche but learning how to manage your breath can be really effective when you experience a panic attack deep breathing has helped me out many times im really sorry i cant make any big suggestions it sounds like what youre experiencing is really quite distressing  i just hope you feel better soon i think that a combination of therapy and medication might help ok so are you familiar with depersonalisation thats the term for feeling like youre watching yourself it happens to me a lot and the more anxious you are the worse it gets   when they suggested cbt did you say youd had it in the past and it wasnt helpful if they know youve had it before and its not worked the might be able to suggest something else   you say your doctor has given up on you what makes you think that you can change your doctor im not sure if you mean a gp or a psychiatrist but its possible to change either most mental health teams have more than one doctor  also did you ask to see a psychologist sometimes you really need to spell out to these people what it is you want and if they disagree  ask them why they dont think its appropriate for you to access these services  a while ago i wanted to try cat but my cpn at the time said she didnt think it would be right so i asked her why and she says that the nature of cat means you need to be pretty stable while youre having it you need to be well in order to be analysed so to speak i suppose it means you can be more objective when looking at the patterns of thoughtsfeelings and so you stand more of a chance of really understanding yourself it makes sense really   how did the people who carried out the assessment leave things with you are you waiting for hear back from them it might be worth calling them and explaining that you were a bit nervous during the assessment and there were a few questions you had that youd forgot to ask then tell them exactly what you need im not surprised youre overwhelmed sounds like youve got a lot on your plate sorry that thats going on with your family am i right in assuming you live with them its hard when someones home environment is stressful when they have mental health issues because at the end of the day you can be getting the best treatment  but if youre being put under stress on a daily basis then youre not going to make a full recovery i hope that when you go for a proper diagnosis and get seen by somebody then can start to really help you and give you the care that you need fingers crossed that youll start to feel better soon hi sorry youve not had a reply yet   i do think social anxiety and paranoia can definitely overlap and it can be hard to know what it is youre experiencing   what kind of paranoia are you having sometimes people can experience paranoia and it isnt a form of psychosis  a more psychotic form of paranoia would involve someone being out of touch with reality hello and welcome to the forum    im no professional but it does sound to me like you are experiencing social anxiety  there isnt always a reason for mental health issues sometimes it just happens  even without an obvious trauma in your life   you really arent overreacting youre not fake youre not looking for an excuse and youre certainly not a whiney baby   its just at the moment youre experiencing some crappy stuff    youre right in that uni is a different vibe from secondary school however there is no denying that it is a similar environment and so it makes sense that some of the feelings you had in school are present at uni   i do think it would be a good idea to reach out to someone but if your university is away from your home its not easy to decide who that should be   id really recommend seeing a gpdoctor as a starting point though  i understand your reluctance but there might be all sorts of things available that might really help and they will be able to point you in the right direction   another suggestion would be to see what student services are available at your uni the only thing with that is that i dont know how specific it would be  there might not be anything targeted at helping anxiety   you might be offered counselling or something though which could help you get out a bit and have someone to chat to about whats happening in your life   have you tried joining any groups or clubs at your university you might not be ready for that or there might not be anything that floats your boat but its worth considering if you looking to make friends   finally i want to say i just wish i could be your friend i hate the thought of anybody having lunch alone ive been that person and its not nice so sending a big hug your way hello and welcome to the forum   well i think youre right in that this does seem to be textbook social anxiety though of course im no professional  i experience it to some extent at the moment but social anxiety was a huge problem for me in the past and so i have a lot of empathy for what youre going through the dread of saying something  no matter how insignificant  its can be completely disabling and leave you feeling like utter crap   my advice would be for you to seek out some professional help  im not sure where youre based but if youre in the uk then make an appointment with your gp and explain whats happening  there are some selfhelp books out there which might be a place to start but its not going to be the thing that really makes a huge difference in my opinion  if you could get some form of therapy maybe cognitive behavioural therapy then i think it might help  im not sure how you would feel about taking medication i definitely wouldnt want to try to persuade you either way but just in case its of interest taking citalopram has had a hugely positive effect on my social anxiety   also do you get out much when youre not working hope you managed to make an appointment  the medication im on is prescription only  side effects were only noticeable in the first week or two i felt quite nauseous and my eyes a bit blurry but i also found it helped me almost immediately which is why i stuck with it   good luck with your meeting   also tabbykittens advice on breathing techniques is very good its another thing ive found can really help i think broddo could be onto something its far easier to dominate and control someone who doesnt appear very confident  i have had the same experience  any man ive had involvement with has been really bad and i do think its because of my anxiety giving off a vibe of powerlessness hi josie sorry that youre struggling with this  it can be really uncomfortable to deal with cant it whats helped me was practising in situations that dont necessarily matter making quick eye contact with a shop assistant when paying for goods for example i think what ultimately helped me though is generally lowering my anxiety levels for me this was done by medication and getting out more and being in company that was supportive eye contact was a problem for me at a really young age whenever i found myself talking to adults   other kids parents and helpers at my playschool  id never look at them when i spoke more often than not id look at my mum as if i were answering to her rather than whoever spoke to me i dont know why it was that bad at such a young age about three  even more odd i was never like it with kids my own age i could look at them fine   thats a really interesting idea its only been in my adult life that ive realised how bad my dad is at giving eye contact hell look the immediate family in the eye but anybody else and he wont look at them again only really since growing up have i realise how shy he is i wonder if that went in subconsciously somewhere hi honeybee welcome to the forum  this is an old thread thought it has had relatively recent posts still i want to make you aware you might not get a massive amount of responses    i can really understand how much this issue can affect you   i used to be terrible when it came to making eye contact   i suppose what helped me was improving my overall anxiety levels   yes medication was a part of that but i also used to slowly make steps forward  say for instance when paying for an item in a shop id make sure that id make eye contact with the shop assistant at least once melandcj has given some really fantastic advise    i just wanted to add that social anxiety isnt a weakness  i think its common for those of us who are socially anxious to generally be quite sensitive intelligent thinking people those are really positive traits and are actually strengths  it may also be that the people you are around arent on the same wavelength as you again theres nothing wrong with that  it just means that you might find conversation and socialising easier with people who are more on your level   social anxiety really sucks and whilst i still deal with it i have come a long way from those painfully awkward days in my past  it can get better i promise i cant really add much to what nikita has said   this unfortunately is common for social anxiety and its something i struggle with too  i have got much better than i was in the past but i feel like ive got a long way to go   ultimately whats helped me is being around people more but also being around people who are safe usually this means women and people who are older than myself  ive found particular activities are usually nurturing environments such as artcraft classes meditation groups just learning how to relax whilst being around people is good  it doesnt necessarily have to be anything too full on that requires lots of conversation   another book ive found helpful has been a woman in your own right  assertiveness and you i guess it deals more with being able to stand up for yourself and have healthy boundaries but its worth a read err i dont like the idea of slowly introducing my body to strangers but the invisibility sounds fantastic importantly people have different thresholds for perceiving responding to and becoming overwhelmed by sensations which are reflected in individuals lifestyles moods and temperaments individuals who are more socially anxious are thought to be innately more sensitive to sensory information increased levels of anxiety contribute to sensory overresponsiveness hypersensitive as arousal increases ones awareness of our surroundings and heightens the likeliness of responding to aversive stimuli           im really glad i found this article and thanks for sharing firemonkee   this is something i experience a lot  it sounds a bit like a catch22 situation though if youre anxious youre more sensitive to stimuli and the more sensitive you are to stimuli the more anxious you get  i suppose this is why escape routes and time to yourself to recharge is really important if you still want the post removed click on the report post button and fill in the form hopefully modsadmin will be able to help i can relate to what youre saying too  it is draining to have real life interactions and to deal with the anxiety that comes with that  i really like the idea of having company because im so alone a lot of the time but the reality of being around people is tough   i think its really good that youve got some good online connections and i think that thats better than nothing   i suppose i would say though is that i do think its important to have some social contact with people  even if its just one person for a short amount of time otherwise things could get worse in terms of anxiety levels   if you can find calm environments to be in thats a good place to start  years ago i used to attend reading groups at my local library i still go to some meditation classes and do pottery all of those activities are quiet and supportive perhaps its something to consider this is something i can relate to  i dont feel that in as a person in a more general sense i am lacking i do have good qualities   but i do feel that i lack that something that enables other people to be able to get on and socialise naturally   the childhood emotional neglect thing isnt something i can easily accept though  my parents were both very loving and supportive so i dont feel neglected by them   then again when i dig deep enough there were times when i felt a bit unrecognised and pushed out  by thats through no fault of my parents  it was because my siblings were being such a pain in the ass that they didnt have time for me i agree with purple in that yes social anxiety can include the things youve said  for me it feels like a big weight or a wall thats in front of me when im having a conversation or im part of a group a part of myself really wants to join in and its like im screaming at myself to loosen up and say something but the social anxiety makes me so tense its like swimming against the tide and yes it can lead to you feeling depressed  have you sought any help for this sort of thing whilst people have different views on what helps and some people dont always get on with medication i have found that taking citalopram has helped me massively in terms of social anxiety so is your fear around the fact that youve never snowboarded before  i am assuming your husband is aware that this is your first time trying it   its understandable to be a bit nervous about it all  but as im sure you may know the fear of doing something is often far worse than actually doing it   i bet that once you get the hang of it youll really enjoy yourself  i know thats not much of a consolation at this precise point in time   one technique ive read is to try and convinced yourself when you feel the physical feelings of fear or nervousness that you are in fact excited  the fearexcitement response in our bodies are pretty much identical  the only thing that makes one unbearable and the other more positive is the content of our thoughts  it may not work but i do think its worth a go i wouldnt say youre abnormal but it does sound like youre giving this a lot more thought than the average person would  as youve posted in the social anxiety section im guessing you are aware that you might have anxiety issues  it also sounds like maybe theres a bit of low selfesteem going on   have you ever had any therapy or maybe looked into selfhelp books that give techniques to help control your thoughts like cbt oh i can relate to this big time   i consider myself to be quite intuitive and have found my nonrational judgments in pas situations to be correct  having said that ive also wasted hours and hours worrying about something that never happened because i was convinced i was being given a sign    its really difficult and i dont think theres any way to know unless you actually do whatever it is thats provoking fear in you  i think the more you prove these intrusive thoughts wrong the better you can get at knowing the difference between the two   i tend to think also that if you know youre on a downer or are generally worrying then a bad thought is more likely to be a just a bad thought  for me its those times where im happy enough but have a sudden gut feeling that are more of the intuitive nature    thats just my opinion anyway am very interested to see other peoples thoughts on this im a bit too far away to attend this but am wishing you good luck in your venture and i hope that you find likeminded people to start so socialise with   also wanted to add that ive found meditationspiritual groups to be quite nonjudgemental and supportive too its helped me a lot from my late teens when i was extremely socially anxious to be involved in these kinds of activities i cant quite understand why its talking about attachment i was very secure in my attachment i was probably one of the only children at play school that didnt cry when their mum left them in the morning probably because i was very confident with children my own age my shyness around adults was terrible though to the point where i often looked to my mum to rescue me from a conversation so that i didnt have to talk  so yeah am not sure where i fit into the attachmentshyness thingy but it definitely makes sense to me that a shyer child is probably more likely to be anxious as a teen i think its very wise to have an escape plan   nothing wrong with saying you need to do some revision   or perhaps depending on what gifts you get you want to go and read your new booklisten to your new cdwhatever is appropriate   think its better that you try and then get away if you need to than hide away so is it tinnitus youre experiencing or is it more in your head if you understand what i mean its really unhelpful that they gp cant help they didnt suggest anything at all  i know it sounds a bit wacky and can understand if its not something youd consider but when i had bad tinnitus once i did some reflexology on myself and it worked i was amazed no reflexology is where there are believed to be certain points on your feet that can be massaged to help heal the body  the point for the ears i think are under just under the toes oh gosh im always doing this and always have done even from a really young age i spend more time living in my daydream world than the real world and it does feel like a chronic thing that i cant always control thanks for the information  its useful to know im not the only one either i wouldnt say i have agoraphobia but i feel im definitely restricted in terms of where i can go without suffering with anxiety some days i cant even make it to the high street i suppose im lucky because it does fluctuate and so some days are better and i feel more independent yes im often daydreaming my daydream world is very full for me its an escape and it also helps me process things sometimes  i agree with billfish that actually it can be  sign of creativity and could be channelled artistically  however i wonder if you feel its just daydreaming or whether its something else sometimes it can seem like im daydreaming but im actually zoning out i wont say i get to a full on dissociative state but i come very close to it this usually happens when im going through a bad time and im finding being fully present too difficult and painful  suppose what im asking is whether or not you think theres something more going on than just your average daydream welcome to the forum it may not be that you have social anxiety in its more typical form but it does sound like theres some struggles there i wish i had an easy answer i can relate to the general awkwardness and feeling like you want to talk but you just cant i can understand your anxiety im sure shell respect your privacy when you need to use the bathroom to wash or go to the loo how long are you staying for i dont shower daily and i dont know if i can speak for anyone else but i do presume that men dont tend to shower as often as women im not saying this to cause a row on here i just mean to reassure you that i wouldnt think it strange if someone didnt shower for a few days  though i do think if the hot weather continues a bath on the third day as in no wash for two days then wash on the third is generally accepted does she not have a shower then  just some advice with the number two situation i sometimes run a tap if im too selfconscious or pull the flush so that it creates some noise it eases my anxiety a bit  as for the pyjamas unless theyve got holes in then i wouldnt worry about putting underpants underneath though if you feel you want to just for you own peace of mind then im sure theres no harm in it  im sorry that youre dealing with this anxiety about the visit hopefully when youre there youll be able to relax and youll adjust x lmao nah living in a hippie town im pretty classy with my thirdday washing routine most people here just dowse themselves in patchouli oil to disguise the grime  i am pretty clean and i dont smell honest  x samesies to most people here  if i spot somebody that i know when im out somewhere i go out of my way to hide from them just so that i dont have to say hello to them i textemail more than i phone i cancel plans i dont have any friends or social life never had a proper boyfriend i only shop late at night in the 24 hour supermarket i breathe like a spazzo bulldog whenever im out because the anxiety and i also sweat a lot i analyse even the shortest and smallest of social exchanges i am still haunted by embarrassment for silly things i said from years ago  the list goes on x it sounds to me as if low selfesteem could possibly be at the route of you comparing yourself to others i think its really easy to see others as better probably now more than ever what with social media but it is an illusion honest im sure ive seen a quote that says something along the lines of dont compare your behind the scenes to somebody elses highlight reel i think its really important to keep in mind that people naturally only present the more appealing parts of themselves to others and you never can really know whats going on for someone at any given moment sometimes people are just better than others at giving off the impression that theyve got their life together and are really happy  as for what you wear i can honestly say that ive never looked at what a womans wearing and judged her perhaps when its cold outside and i see a girl wearing i short skirt i spare a thought for how bloody freezing she must be but i wouldnt consider someone a slut for what they wear or for that matter a prude you really must just find what you feel comfortable in and really work on understanding that people are probably not even taking any notice of your clothes  the thing is with anxiety is that it can make you feel as if the spotlight is on you and that everybody is looking at you making judgements etc but the truth is most people are so absorbed in their own thoughts and what theyre doing that they probably dont even notice you x for me it was the other way around i found that improving my social anxiety was what got rid of the psychosis i think the social anxiety has been the issue all along my psychotic thoughts seemed to be linked to my social fears  being watched being filmed having my thoughts broadcast all of these were stemming from my fear of being looked at and being noticed there was something about the fear of being exposed and observed which got out of control and turned into psychoticdelusional thinking  sorry if thats not quite the answer you were looking for just wanted to say that i really think in my case the two are closely linked x i see this is your first post  welcome to the forums  have you been diagnosed with any mental health issues  i think sometimes when youre struggling with your mental health the brain can get to overwhelmed and it switches off because its just too overwhelming to be feeling everything all the time  of course i dont know if thats a scientific or proven explanation its just the way i explain what happens to me  what im saying is sometimes feelings are so difficult to access it can feel like theyre not there at all and it can be quite worrying to think that you are void of any emotions   youve not shared much about your past or present circumstances but perhaps there are reasons why you cant readily feel your feelings x im glad to hear that you dont have a problem with this now that youre stable  thats really quite remarkable lineups arent so much an issue for me however i hate crowds my anxiety in crowds has never gone away no matter what ive tried i just see it as part of who i am rather than an illness i think i am too sensitive to be around to many people and so now i just avoid being in crowded places   out of curiosity would you say its the pills that have made a difference to you its interesting to know whats helped x i cant say for sure because its not the same for everybody i say yes you probably will feel some side effects again  for me nausea has always been the main side effect of citalopram ive been on 20mg 40mg and even 60mg and on each dose increase i found myself feeling sick all over again it does wear off though im currently taking 20mg which is the standard dose and i do find that citalopram has been the most effective antidepressant in terms of my social anxiety i hope you find it helpful too  fingers crossed for you x i do agree and would also add that outside experiences such as being bullied also contributes  its a bloody hard cycle to break though when it comes to staying in i suppose its all about going outside of your comfort zone and challenging yourself but i think youve got to have a certain amount of confidence to do that in the first place  x to be fair meds have helped me in terms of my social anxiety  once id taken citalopram for about a fortnight i was finding that i was naturally joining in conversations and wasnt overthinking everything  trouble is it hasnt helped me a great deal with other types of anxiety i get x welcome to the forum hope you join in the forums and that you find it helpful its been really great for me in terms of helping with my sense of loneliness whilst its not real life its a great place for support and community x yes  butterflies are definitely a part of any anxiety or phobia it also can wreak havoc with your digestive system sometimes it can go one of two ways either leaving you blocked or needing to go to the toilet more often apparently there are different remedies you can take to help with the toilet issue some herbal and others more conventional meds but i havent really found a way of getting rid of the butterflies x i do share your anxiety with going away from home  even if im still local if im not sleeping in my own bed and waking up in my own space i get really stressed out  i presume you will have your own room i think it may help you cope if you take some time to be by yourself for a while each day even if its just taking a short walk  if youre not used to being around people then i do think its natural to want some space   i wouldnt worry at all about her friends if they meet you the chances are they wont take much notice of you and wont judge you i know ive rarely taken much notice of friends parents   at the end of the day shes invited you to be there and so she wants your company quirks and all if she felt you were going to be worry or a burden in any way then im sure shed have found an excuse not to invite you x it may feel like an overreaction to you especially if you are not used to standing up for yourself but i think it would be wise to inform the police i dont know where you stand if you handed over the money willingly i use quotation marks because thats debatable seeing as you struggle with saying no however from what you say it sounds like this man is targeting vulnerable people for his own gain also as others have said he could potentially start harassing you big time and may even start to threaten you or worse   in the past and still now really its been hard for me to stand up for myself but easier to take action if i think some other person may be affected what im getting at is that by telling the police you may be able to prevent other vulnerable people from being exploited in a similar way  assertiveness is very difficult ive read a book called a woman in your own right  assertiveness and you and that has helped me i dont know if youre female or male but to be honest im not sure why the title of the book was so gender specific i thought the advice in it was beneficial to all it helped me because it included some thorough advice about saying no one particular thing i picked up was that you dont have to give a reason for saying no in fact the author practically discouraged you from doing so because by giving a reason it leaves you open to negotiation and being manipulated into changing your mind thats been a breakthrough for me  i often used to use any excuse to get out of situations like i dont have any money often someone would come back with ill lend you some and id be back to square one  it takes a lot of practise i am a chronic people pleaser but i do feel ive made progress in this area though still have some way to go i know its a bit of a cheesy quote but those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind you dont owe this person or anybody else to tries to take advantage of you anything x im hypersensitive too which leads to my social anxiety i dont think its something that will go away because its part of who you are the only thing that helps for me is to develop a more subjective way of seeing things deep inside i can be extremely hurt by something small but ive learned and am still learning to reason with my extremely sensitive self eg i say good morning to someone they give me a short response which i felt was unfriendly my sensitive side would be thinking that ive done something wrong they hate me etc but my reasoning would say perhaps theyre having a bad day maybe theyre tired they might have a headache and not be in the mood to chat   also for me the number one rule is to remember that not everybody thinks like you do i know it sounds obvious but countless times ive been so hurt by somebodys actions ive felt like i must be a really awful person for someone to treat me a certain way because id never do that to somebody well not everybody is as sensitiveempathetic what you might deem hurtful somebody else wont even be capable of considering it potentially upsetting its worked both ways too sometimes ive made a joke and immediately apologised after saying that i was so sorry and i didnt mean to be horrible pretty much every time the person has told me they werent even bothered and i could see they werent just trying to protect my feelings they genuinely didnt carefound it funny  its a tough world out there so take care just thought id put that in as someone that relates to what youre saying i can relate to every single item on that list  ill also add going shopping so much to get yourself wound up about  if i chose a normal checkout i worry that the store staff and everybody behind me are judging what im buying i worry about the small talk i worry when ive only got lots of change that the staff might find that irritating that people are waiting while im counting the pennies  its not very often at all ill look a cashier in the eye because im so wound up   selfservice isnt much better please wait for assistance  oh my god theyre going to think ive stolen something  x just wanted to say youre really brave for taking up the training and putting yourself out there  it may be possible that youre overthinking i dont need to tell you because im sure you already know but our brains can be torturous in making us relive embarrassing moments and making us feel like everybodys thinking unfavourable things about us  im sure things will get better in time as other people have said  dont be too hard on yourself v its early days and you have already done so well  x no dont stop going to class it sounds like your depressionanxiety is getting the better of you you must remember that these thoughts you are having are not a true reflection of how things are  im sure your teacher doesnt think any bad things about you at all its more like youre being hard on yourself are you managing to keep up with what youre being taught is this effecting your work x its easier said than done but getting out there is the only way to meet people going to groups evening classes and courses has been good to help me build up my confidence sometimes ive done a short course and not made any permanent new friends but it was still good to have the experience of being around people and having nothing bad happen try looking to see what there is in your area that might attract the type of people you want to meet if youre creative look at artcraft groups that sort of thing x welcome to the forum   im sorry to hear of your struggles both past and present its quite clear that youre feeling really pressured and thats not helping matters at all    are you under the care of a mental health team it doesnt sound like you are in which case have you ever told your gp how you feel x sounds like a really stressful situation you could have done without to be fair you cannot be responsible for the actions of other people  even those closest to you you didnt do anything or write anything on facebook from what i gather and so it was a situation that blew up without you having a look in i can understand how you may feel betrayed by the people at work and angry about the situation as its affected your relationship  it may be that this situation at work is just going to take time to heal did you get an apology do you feel like the women involved are carrying the situation on or are being cold towards you in some way you dont have anything to feel awkward about and it should be those who were writing the stuff on your facebook that should be feeling awkward about it  if you like your job and have other friends there supporting you then you mustnt feel like you should leave x sounds like problems you can do without the bloke whos messing about with blocking you and whatnot obviously isnt really someone you can call a friend sounds a bit immature to be honest i dont know whether he iswas a long term friend but sometimes people just arent worth the hassle youve got to keep your chin up and walk away x tabbykitten is right tell them how you feel  are you already registered with a dentist or will you need to find a new one  either way when making the appointment explain your situation theyve always got a medical form to fill out i seem to need to do one every time i go so that will give them some idea of your health history   if a dentist and dental assistant knows that youre quite phobic of the experience theyre mostly quite understanding  they offer you numbing too so dont worry about things being too painful  i was actually quite amazed when i had a filling taken out to be replaced with a crown i honestly couldnt feel a thing because id had an injection which by the way wasnt bad  ive unwittingly bitten the inside of my mouth and its been more painful    really hope you can get this sorted soon x im sure this is something people can relate to even those people who dont really have particularly bad social anxiety   but sometimes my brain decides to torture me by replaying moments where ive said or done something really stupidembarrassingfoolish  its almost like a youve been framed montage god i hate that programme  of all the times ive made an utter tit out of myself and totally humiliated myself   obviously this is distressing enough but it just makes my social anxiety worse   i just think to myself god im such a cringey person and vow never to talk again to anyone in my whole life    does anyone else get this and if so have you found anything helps  i suppose i just need to find some affirmation or kind words that i can say to myself while all of this is going on in my mind because it really does make me want to never speak again x im sure you dont need me to tell you that alcohol is not going to help you at all   it may placate you in the shortterm but it could create bigger problems in the long run  alcohol is a depressant and so can affect your thinking so yeah i dont want to be bossy or tell you what to do because each of us have our own ways of dealing with things but just wanted to say that it might be causing you to feel much worse  im not sure how things work if you dont have health insurance would seeing a psychiatrist set you back a lot of money if its something you can afford to do then id suggest to you that you do it you talk of experiencing things which sound really distressing however im sure a good psychiatrist can assess you and help you  is your husband aware of the difficulties youre facing i know it can be really hard to explain and some thoughtsfeelings are just too intimate to share when youre depressed i just wonder if perhaps you could just say that youre feeling very stressed and dont know how to deal with things that he might show some understanding and offer support if he doesnt know somethings not quite right then he cant help x well done for spending time detoxing hope youre feeling a bit better because of it i hate crowds too  all that crap flying around in the atmosphere the claustrophobia the noise  no thank you  obviously having a panic attack is horrible for you but sitting by the side of the road can be quite a good thing if youre in a situation where you need to be in a crowded area for a while such as a wedding then taking time out for some airspace and then going back in can be helpful i always try to stay at the side of a room or in a corner rather than be in the centre of things having some water to sip helps me anxiety gives me a dry mouth so drinking water stops that also i find that by taking sips of water my breathing returns to a more reasonable level as a bonus in terms of social anxiety if things are awkward then having water in your mouth is a very good reason for not talking  deep breathing i know its a cliche but breathe deeply and slowly stretch out so that your muscles get a break from being all tensed up and really try to focus on feeling your feet on the ground  and always knowing where your exit is if you can sitstand with the exit in your sight even better not that anything bad is going to happen and youll need it  i just find it helpful to know where i can leave when i want to it can be quite empowering being by the door and not using it like youre the one in control not the anxiety x i can relate to this so youre not on your own with feeling this way angelinblack  sometimes it gets really bad ill be in a group of people and be totally zoned out thinking about selfharming i remember one particularly painful big family gathering where i was just sat there staring into thin air considering all the ways i might kill myself  it can be really stressful being around people even if nobodys being particularly unkind youve obviously got quite introvert tendencies so the trick is to take time out alone or sit to one side with just one other person who youre comfortable with thats presuming youre with familyfriends x ive always been a shy girl and during my teens it turned into social anxiety though thats not my first and foremost diagnosis its something which still affects me so youre not alone   im fine with some people with others i just cant stand to talk i have no idea why other than i dont want to say anything wrong or embarrass myself  i know this seems like a bit of a bogstandard response but have you talked to your doctor about it they could hopefully put you in touch with what might help  for me personally ive found that antidepressant have done and still do a lot for my social phobiafear of talking im still in control of what i say but i find that im talking more easily i dont sit in a group of people absolutely rigid and dreading being spoken to i feel much more relaxed comparing the periods of being without meds to how i am with them its a huge difference  it would be good if you could explore the reasons why you feel this way in therapy as i mentioned above my root is saying something wrong that will ultimately lead to me being rejected and alone although i can see how by not opening up to people im alone anyways so might as well take the risk  ultimately you do need to put yourself out there but i dont think its wise to jump in at the deep end try to get some useful tools ie meds therapy counselling etc that will help you cope and feel at least a little bit better about being around people im from the uk so i dont really understand about getting medical cover and things but how would you go about getting cover again while i agree that medication isnt a cure and that problems are still around when you take them i do think that they can help you manage the more severe episodes and manifestations of your illness for example crying hysterically and hyperventilating is absolutely no joy for you at all and you shouldnt have to be experiencing it without some form of help  are people staff at your college aware of your difficulties are there any student support services available to you hello this thread is a week old but i hope youre still around browsing the site to read my reply your question have you felt like this just made me go yes  there are certain things youve written that i could have written myself when i was 15 its actually quite uncanny to be blunt teenage years are fcking awful i dont want to sound like your mother and im not belittling what youre going through at all i just want you to know that it will get easier in a few years  im 23 and im still awkward sometimes still selfconscious and can still feel my face going a wonderful shade of magenta when i talk to people but this is only in certain situations and only when im having a bad day hallelujah its not every second of every day like it used to be  a lot of my problem was being more emotionally intelligent and more mature than people my age do you feel that perhaps other teens arent quite on your wavelength i have about a handful of people my own age that im friends with the rest are a lot older and i feel able to be myself around them perhaps you should think about what interests you have and see what groups there are in your area obviously youre busy with school but maybe when you leave and enter the bigger world youll have more time to explore and meet people more like you who will make you feel more at ease in their company because i think thats a key factor with social anxiety if youre with people who you feel would judge or mock you then its not going to help you at all if youre around supportive and accepting people then youll feel more able to come out of your shell  something that a psychologist told me to do that helped a lot was that i should build up a bank of positive social experiences in my mind hold onto memories of when i was relaxed confident and had a good time being sociable because if your bank is only full of those times where you messed up then youre not going to feel encouraged or inspired to get out there at all i could be wrong but i think a lot of people with social anxiety prefer to be around a certain gender more than another personally i find it hard around men too even if its not someone i find attractive i just find it hard to relate to them so i dont know what to say with reguards to the virgin thing im so pleased you said you were proud because theres no shame in it at all i think when you meet the right person and you tell them youre a virgin theyll be really supportive of that they wont expect you to be amazing so dont worry if hes the right man for you hell understand and youll get better with each time anyway  i can see how being isolated as a teen hasnt helped with your anxiety from the age of 12 onwards i had home tuition so i know how it can affect your anxiety levels  with reguards to your communication disorder i think its totally up to you if you tell people upon meeting them or not do you worry if you told people that they would judge you or do you think that it would make you feel easier knowing that they know personally id wait and see what the person is like if they seemed nice and nonjudgemental id tell them i find the more im putting myself under pressure so say the right thing the harder it is to speak so anything you can do that will relieve that pressure can only be good i agree with what sarahd has suggested   you may have some success if you have a conversation or you may not it depends on where shes at in terms of her perspective of things   i would talk to a doctor and seek advice from them if she isnt willing to speak to somebody herself   the thing is i have experienced exactly the same as her in the past and its really horrible to go through so even if you do end up speaking to somebody without her permission it really is being cruel to be kind she will be suffering and so if you can bring about something that can help to end that it will be for the best hello and welcome to the forum    what strikes me is that you have good insight into how these things seem to feed into each other  anxiety can make you feel physically unwell which in turn makes you more anxious and its a vicious circle  having that awareness feels to me like an important first step   have you considered talking to a gp about your anxiety they may be able to point you in the direction of some support   the other thing that might be worth considering is keeping a track of how youre feeling each day physically and mentally  there are lots of apps you can get on your phone that can help with this i personally use health mapper  it can be really helpful to look back and think ive had these physical feelings before and i ended up being fine it was anxiety making it worse   i have to keep doing it with chest pains i get the amount of times ive been convinced i was having a heart attack when it turned out to be anxiety   i still have to be very mindful even now when i get chest pains but having that past experience to look back on can be reassuring ive also had thoughts of killing my brother but thoughts are just thoughts  i dont truly want to murder anybody because any type of violence makes me sick to my stomach i cant handle witnessing any kind of abuse   its just the fantasy of no longer having him around and no longer having the stress that i find appealing but you can get that distance and peace without resorting to murder   when you move out yes cut him out of your life you dont ever have to talk to him again if thats what you choose  it can be empowering to take control of you life in that way personally cutting all ties is the best thing that way you dont get sucked into any more of the drama or risk getting involved in any arguments that will drag you down   also why on earth would you want to fuck up your own life just to get some kind of revenge think about how unhappy you would be for the rest of your life most certainly spending a large chunk of it in prison plus im sure other members of the family would have strong feelings about it and you could end up making yourself completely ostracised   i just wanted to say also that domestic abuse includes abuse among family members it does not just happen between partners  the definition includes family members too  i would suggest doing an internet search to just see what domestic abuse services there are in your area   dont let the bastard get you down for any longer than he already has x first of all im really sorry to hear about your experiences at your last house how awful it must have been for you   its understandable that you are a bit sensitive to things now as a result of the way you were treated  on the one hand it does sound like youre being hypersensitive   but on the other hand i think id be offended and upset if someone had imitated a giggle also if people were asking me about noises in my flat id find it quite intrusive   clearly there are issues with soundproofing i sincerely hope that the council do something about it because its not just you whos being affected by it   in the meantime a couple of practical things might help  do you wear earplugs to bed  also i spend a lot of time listening to music through headphones when i can hear my neighbour being really loud i just put the volume up it blocks out the sound and nobody can complain because its through headphones   im sorry i cant be more helpful perhaps someone else might be more in the know about what you can do you know those ice packs you use to put in picnic bags i have two smallish ones i got them out of the freezer and put them on the bottom of my feet with a sock on top to keep it in place it really seemed to help hello and welcome to the forum   youre definitely not alone here    ive read through your post and i agree with your therapist  you could really do with some selfcare and focusing your love on your own family rather than trying to take on too much of outside stuff   its definitely not easy and it takes a lot of practise   sometimes youll completely forget to look after yourself but thats ok  dont beat yourself up if youve beaten yourself up    im really sorry i dont have much in terms of advice im working on the selfcare thing a lot at the moment too and i also get anxiety so i can relate i think that fighting them can give them too much of your focus and that can reinforce the anxiety youre experiencing the more you tell yourself not to think about something or that youre thinking is wrong the more likely you are to think about it for instance if i tell you that you arent allowed to think about a pink giraffe the first thing that comes into your mind is going to be a pink giraffe  this probably sounds really weird but when i get intrusive thoughts that are distressing i say to myself i want to go to the beach somehow it snaps me out of that cycle of the intrusive thoughts overpowering me and instead i start to think about what kind of beach i want to go to does it have sand or pebbles how deep is the sea whats the weather like etc  i dont think watching porn with have an affect on your sexuality or that youll turn it doesnt work like that otherwise those fundamental christian idiots who try to convert people into being straight would be far more successful than they are   are you seeing anybody for your mental health at all i think that intrusive thoughts can be more of a problem the more anxious you are if you can get some help to lessen your anxiety you might find that they become less frequent i know this is really random but are the voices in the guided meditation annoying at all    ive got sleeping headphones too and struggle with insomnia so this might be really helpful   im just a bit picky about peoples voices this hot weather is making me feel really shit   i feel trapped like theres no escape from it and im stuck with it and its making me feel like i cant breathe and i dont know what to do thanks everyone for your replies    im sorry some of you are experiencing the same    its just making my anxiety go through the roof the second i dont feel like i have a choice about something it really winds me up and makes me want to escape    i might try a wet towel ive been putting cold water on my feet and wrists but i dont have much energy to keep going to the bathroom to do that   exfbu  i did manage to get my medication sorted thank you for remembering and asking me about it hello and welcome to the forum  im sorry youve not had a response yet   i think it may be due to the section youve posted in ill ask a moderator to move this as you might get more views if its somewhere else its tricky to know where to post because this is such a big forum   anyway in answer to your question about when these kinds of thoughts stop being natural and become paranoia i think its all to do with how they affect you  if youre getting very anxious and the thoughts are really gripping you id say its becoming a problem  if its a natural lowkey kind of thing its far easier to be reassured by checking the door once for instance and then being able to let the thought go   i dont think the doctors are there to tell you off if you have come off of medication its not their job to do that  do you feel like it would be a good idea to go back to a doctor and be seen again perhaps a different doctor this time who will be able to look at you with a fresh pair of eyes   whilst its really common for depression and anxiety to go hand in hand you can get one without the other so just because your mood isnt low it doesnt mean to say you arent suffering with anxiety i wonder if its the release of chemicalshormones oxytocin that helps is it specifically the sex or the general comfort of being close to someone  its interesting not something id be interested in at all  but i admire the sex worker whos speaking in the article  i think its great to have that healing intention what does this money mean to you im wondering if on a deeper level you have issues around security and safety  the money in your account could be like an outward symbol of being secure hence you are spending so much time checking and being very protective of it perhaps its also something you can control if maybe your dont feel control in other areas of your life  i could be completely wrong of course  its just from personal experience when my life is feeling really precarious and scary i suddenly get very focused on having enough moneyfoodmaterial things around me please dont think im being the health police  ive got plenty of bad habits   but i dont drink purely because of how awful alcohol makes me feel i know i get a lot of scary symptoms like palpitations and my heart doing weird things hey welcome to the forum  i agree with the points that naominash has made  its really vital to care for yourself on a basic level by getting enough sleep and food   i am wondering if perhaps youre experiencing post traumatic stress disorder im not a doctor or anything but it does sound that would be a disorder that is close to describing what youre experiencing  have you sought out any help from a counsellor or doctor it would be great if you had some help with getting through this because it sounds like its really impacting your life theres definitely no harm in getting checked out your doctor will be able to examine you and rule out any physical cause  personally i dont think it sounds like its anything too sinister  unfortunately anxiety can have huge affect on your body and it can sometimes even make people convinced theyre dying  it took me a long time to learn that my chest pains werent a heart attack its always down to stress and anxiety hello and welcome to the forum    it sounds like youve been through a lot but you  have also done a lot of work on yourself especially in admitting to yourself that youve kept a secret for so long   i dont want to sound patronising but that is really brave   are you getting any counselling to help you through what you are only now starting to get in touch with   i think it might be really helpful for you to have that space to talk about whatever you want without judgement and it might also help lessen your anxiety   i really feel for you because i know exactly what you mean   i am very selfconscious about what i say and to who because i have felt at times that i have overshared things that arent appropriate or embarrassed myself for talking a load of rubbish  its difficult because it then causes you to overthink about whether or not people are judging you which in turn just gives you more anxiety   my theory is that i spent a lot of my life being quite isolated and out of touch with myself and others  with what youre going through it makes me think it might be similar for you  youre only just discovering your real self which almost means learning to be you again   there are bound to be some bumps in the road when it comes to talking and socialising whilst youre growing as a person   i think the most important thing is to be compassionate towards yourself telling yourself youve said something wrong wont help at all i can relate to what youre experiencing definitely i also seem to need more sleep than the average person it makes me wonder if theres a connection somewhere  on the forum elsewhere i was only saying that i was considering one of those alarm clocks that wake you up more naturally with light  its not arrived yet but im hoping it will help me get past that feeling of panic when i wake up  im just wondering how your dreams are in general i get a lot of nightmares and i think that doesnt help weird thing is its not always big events that i get this with  sometimes it can be as little as knowing i have to go to the supermarket  before i open my door to leave my flat i always get those butterflies and shallow breaths    its helpful to find a term for it so thanks for sharing this link seems like ive just made a step in knowing what it is it might sound a bit wacky or out there but if you do have a fear of being attacked have you considered selfdefence classes it might not be your cup of tea and thats ok its just a thought  there are things you can legally do to ensure that you are safe when you go out and about  im wondering what kind of an area you live in its not that im trying to belittle your fears at all i just personally think there are different risks living in an urban vs living in a rural area   i used to fear going out on my own a lot but got a bit better by starting small  being somewhere very safe library reading groups helped me a lot it helped me slowly increase my confidence in being in public    it can and does get better though i used to only ever go to the supermarket with my parents and would freak out if they didnt stay in the same aisle as me i never thought that would change but my anxiety in that sense has got a lot better   its definitely doable i have borderline personality disorder and feeling like i was being watched was one of the first symptoms that i had i felt like i was being secretly filmed and my life was being shown on tv like the truman show  paranoia and transient psychosis is a known trait of bpd its really horrible to be feeling like this i know firsthand are you on any meds at the moment are you seeing a cpn or psychiatrist the impact of social isolation   social psychological and medical research has now demonstrated conclusively that there is a direct correlation between the degree to which a person feels connected to others and their physical and mental health   here are some of the most commonly known effects of not feeling a connection to others   generally decreased feeling of vitality less energy and feeling tired more often  greater likelihood of chronic illness such as heart disease cancer diabetes etc  more frequent bouts of sickness such as colds or flu and longer recovery times  longer recovery times from injury  regular feelings of loneliness  increased likelihood of depression  decreased level of happiness and satisfaction with life in general  shorter life spans   also on that link it says    feelings of social isolation are linked to alterations in the activity of genes that control inflammation the study provides a molecular framework for understanding why social factors are linked to an increased risk of heart disease viral infections and cancer  study by university of california   every time i have a blood test my inflammation markers are high and for no obvious reason thats really fascinating hello and welcome to the forum   i know what you mean about intrusive thoughts and the endless cycle of thinking about it not thinking about it thinking about not thinking about it   i hope you find the forum helpful and feel less alone knowing that other people experience the same sort of thing not sure how old your boyfriend and friends are clouds  but when i was younger and got about with girls my own age 20 at that time they were really rubbish at offering any kind of support or empathy   id say i needed some company because i was down but when i met up with them i couldnt get a word in edgeways it felt hugely disappointing   it could be a lack of maturity or a lack of knowledge or skill when it comes to dealing with other peoples emotions   do you get understanding when youre unwell in physical ways are the people in your life generally supportive in other ways   perhaps it might be worth explaining what you like or need when you confide in people even if you tell them its fine if they dont know what to say to you all you want is a sympathetic ear   theres a big difference between pretending nothings been said and saying listen im really crap at dealing with emotional stuff but if theres anything i can do to help you feel better then let me know long time no see how are you keeping i really feel for you on this one  its something i used to suffer with terribly i am better now than i was but ive still got a way to go until im satisfied with my level of confidence  its all a very horrible selfconscious cycle isnt it    the trouble is when it comes to things like eye contact and looking the more anxious you are the more likely people are to look at you strangely and so it becomes a bit of a selffulfilling prophecy   i remember going out one day and i felt like people were giving me really weird looks it wasnt until i sat down and a lady asked me if i was ok because i looked terrified that i realised why i was getting stared at   having said all of this people rarely pay that much attention to anybody else even more so in the last couple of years now that everybody is addicted to their mobile phone   i would say that as its now getting to a point where youre avoiding going to lectures and going out its probably wise that you seek out some help with this  as previously suggested your uni more than likely has services that can help you out and from what i hear some universities are very good at helping you out on a more practical level too  not sure how far away you are from home or if you have a local walkin centre but it might be a good idea to see a gp too   i very much agree with chris in that this is definitely something you can get through and it will get better   just to add that i improved with the help of an ssri medication and going to places that were supportive and nurturing like meditation groups or library groups  i found it much easier to improve my confidence around people if i knew i was going into an environment where it would be quiet and accepting ive absolutely no idea what same is and thats after a google search is it sold as a supplement in a tablet form do you buy it legitimately  if somethings not working then i dont know if there is a lot you can do to make it work better i know people talk of hacks involving taking various things alongside other meds or supplements which im not going to list in case anybody gets any ideas but its all very risky especially if there hasnt been any proper research into the effects  i can really appreciate that you might not want to go for more conventional medicine because thats not for everyone but have you tried any other prescribed meds apart from venlaflaxine  personally i had a very hard time on venlaflaxine at stopped taking it within a week because it was too much to bear but ive had more luck with citalopram and its helped me a lot  if you are looking into something more alternative have you tried the standard sort of herbs like lavender chamomile valerian etc i know certain pharmacies and chemists have herbal supplements for anxiety  just a comment on the misty hazy not really there feeling  ive found that some meds can make depersonalisationderealisation much worse which in turn has created more anxiety its something to be aware of sometimes its pleasant to feel a bit floaty but other times its made me really panic reading your post is enough to make somebody really despise humanity  im not saying that to make you feel bad im just incredibly sorry to hear about your downright cruel and upsetting experiences  yes you were racially abused and no you are not being paranoid   the way you were treated is absolutely disgusting and if you had gone to the police i seriously think that the people involved in such hated and abuse should have been arrested  do not doubt yourself for one second their behaviour was unaccepted   so am i reading your weight right are you 95lbs or did you forget to add a 1 before that im sorry im just a bit confused because if you are 95lbs you would according to the bmi which isnt always accurate but still be considered underweight   not that it matters either way it sounds to me as if you were a target and the things that were said to you were not based on truth but said so that the bullies could get a sick sense of power and a cheap laugh  i do think that abusive people can sense a vulnerable person which may be why other people who might have been a bit more odd than you were accepted and you werent  sometimes people can just sense a different energy and attack what they dont understand  i wonder if actually you werent more graceful more gentle and kinder than other people and thats what the bullies didnt like   being quite pale white myself i cant pretend to know how it feels to want to lighten your skin and so im sorry in that sense that i cant truly understand  but i do wish that you were told as a teen that you were beautiful and that you absolutely did not need to do that to yourself from what i understand it can be quite dangerous and so im really glad you no longer do this    do you think your mum is beautiful do you think your cousins are beautiful  sometimes its easier to see beauty in other people than it is ourselves but if you can acknowledge their beauty it might help in terms of coming to accept yourself   ultimately i do think you are at the beginning of a journey of selfacceptance and that can be really hard  you must remember that other peoples comments about your appearance are pure ignorance and it really reflects how ugly they are as people if they feel the entitlement to put a stranger down  beauty really is only skin deep and it doesnt last forever people age and they change   innerbeauty and a good heart lasts a lifetime   how do you feel about yourself as a person not thinking about how you look  i mean who you are  i think one of the things that helped me get over my physical selfloathing was the realisation that im a good person and the world needs good people now more than ever yes i get the same feeling i also get it when on the rare occasion that i exercise and get short of breath so at least for myself i know its not necessarily a bad thing ive found keeping hydrated can help though drinking water whilst youve got the sore throat feeling does make me feel worse thank goodness for that  they dragged the whole thing out for long enough didnt they    and yes stay out of trouble but im glad that its all over now must be a huge relief its actually been a long time since i first spoke to my gp about my mental health issues and as i was a young person at the time i got a referral to the child and adolescent mental health services really quickly so i dont really know how things go if somebody visits a doctor as an adult however i do just want to really encourage you to seek help and say that as scary as it might seem it will hopefully be worth it because it sounds like youve been struggling on your own for too long hi and welcome to the forum   i have a lot of pain in my body and do suspect i have fibromyalgia though ive continually seen my doctor for how i feel and its not even been mentioned  perhaps i should just say i think its something ive got but dont want to come across as one of those annoying patients that selfdiagnoses through the internet    it may be that i dont have fibro though  i do think anxiety and ptsd type symptoms cause the body an incredible amount of stress and that can manifest in pain and aching  i also experience lots of types of pain  from random jolting to dull aching   i just take painkillers when i really need them and try not to overuse them because that makes them less effective  a hot water bottle and comfortable clothing nothing too tight really helps   finally i dont know how your sleeping is but i have nightmares and a lot of anxiety around bedtime if youre not sleeping well then that can have a massive effect on pain and aching    i really hope you can get sorted and start to feel better soon it sounds like youve been through a lot im sorry that youre going through this katya   dont know if its much of a consolation but what you wrote describes how i feel quite often and im still living to tell the tale so while it feels really serious try not to panic because it probably is just awful anxiety   i think getting a doctors note tomorrow and perhaps getting hold of some valium at the same time if thats possible might be the best idea for now   just a few tips  i find a cold glass of water helps me feel better and can regulate my breathing   splashing a bit of cold water on my face helps too if i cant snap out of very shallow or missed breathing  dont wear a bra whenever possible not sure about you but im pretty busty and having a bra literally restricting my chest doesnt help at all  open a windowfresh air   also is it possible that you might have pulled a muscle in your chest just a random thought but sometimes when i think about it sometimes i can recall straining maybe through coughingvommingsneezing   i really hope you feel better soon im sorry if by reminding you about tomorrow is not welcome in this thread and youre trying to distract yourself but i do want to wish you the best and say good luck im glad to hear that a short film has been made and there is a campaign for greater awareness i dont know but i imagine it must be really difficult to have bdd  not just because of all of the unrealistic images of beauty that we are bombarded with but because sadly being unhappy with your appearance is very common i hope that this will make people think twice about saying things like oh everybody is insecure about their appearance i feel for you  anxiety and panic is awful and it can get really unbearable not that i think there is any reason for you to worry but i agree that perhaps talking to your doctor about this might be a good idea  as i said im sure these feelings are down to anxiety but its best to get an overall check of your blood pressure and stuff just to be on the safe side i hope you feel better soon and get some good rest tonight x nice calming music and cute animals  whats not to love  thanks for sharing its a beautiful video welcome to the forum  medication and therapy obviously do have their benefits but nothing beats actually facing your fears headon social anxiety really sucks but ive only really made serious improvements since i got out and met new people  there are some less scary environments to be in that others if i were you when youre ready id start off by getting out to somewhere that isnt too high pressured poetry cafes were a godsend to me when i was starting to get out more they were held in the evening in a poorly lit cafe there was no conversation only listening to someone read so i was among people with no pressure to talk  ideal this court case thing has been going on a long time hasnt it must be really driving you around the bend i hope that it can finally be sorted in three weeks time and i hope that youre right in thinking that youll get a positive outcome it takes the mickey that youve had to wait so long really my inner child would love to be friends with your innerchild she doesnt have to talk if she doesnt want to  we can just play side by side    i have similar feelings around my innerchild too i was a very shy child  also some days i dont feel the 25 years old that i actually am i feel like im 5 years old again citalopram has helped with my social anxiety but overall anxiety and more traumarelated symptoms havent really been helped by anything its highly unlikely but not impossible that you could get serotonin sydrome from the prozac you are taking im sorry if thats not the most reassuring of answers but i wanted to be realistic though i would remind you that it is extremely rare   sometimes i get very caught up in philosophical wondering its very hard to articulate precisely what goes on in my mind but its almost as if i can see the architecturestructure of reality and i see how flimsy it really is also this reality seems very linear and i believe that things arent really that linear  that there are layers and layers and layers to the great mystery of life and the universe that probably doesnt make much sense   anyway it sounds to me like you have a very intelligent mind and im wondering if having something really academic to get your teeth into might be a good thing i think that if youre bright and your mind isnt stimulated it can easily turn in on itself and cause these very sorts of issues with overthinking and so even if its just puzzle solving like crosswords in newspapers perhaps that would put your intelligence to use and at least temporarily relieve this anxiety it may not be that your friend is deliberately hiding things from you  it could just be that she doesnt see the activities she does with this other friend as significant also you mention that she says she doesnt really like this person i wonder if shes too polite to tell her welcome to the forum    how long have you been on your medication for sometimes it takes a while for it to kick in also it can take you trying out several medications before you find one that works for you   what do you do during the day i wonder how structured your day is and if working on a routine might help  have you noticed anything in particular that triggers your anxiety   it sounds to me like you are really doing some good things in terms of walking and breathing exercises so it must be frustrating for you not to be feeling much different   being creative is something i find helps me feel a bit better  even if its doing colouring in you can find loads of good adult colouringin books online my whole mind gets absorbed in what im doing and so the anxiety temporarily goes away   im not sure how able you are to concentrate but activities like crosswords and the like also help me too welcome to the forum   did anything in particular start this fear or has it seemingly come out of the blue i appreciate that you said youve been getting anxiety since last summer but im wondering if a specific event might have triggered something  for instance a bereavementillnesstraumatic event  have you sought professional help at all the reason i ask is that im wondering if your overall anxiety level was reduced it might help ease your fear around sleep  im not sure if youve looked around the forum yet but in the specific phobias subsection there are several threads from members who have a fear of sleeping the particular threads and members dont appear to be active recently but it may be helpful for you to look through some of those threads  personally i dont really fear sleep itself but i do have massive issues around safety when i go to bed i cannot sleep anywhere other than my own flat i have to have a light on i have to have a fan blowing on my face i have to wear earplugs i have to have the blind down in my window  unless i have these things i wont sleep but all of this stems from a fear of being attacked while im asleep rather than actually being asleep if that makes sense  nonetheless i am wondering if youve found any practical things help you feel more relaxed at bedtime i think that there is only so much one person can do as frustrating as that can be when it comes to someone we care about i think encouraging her to seek help and letting her know you are there for her if she needs support is the best thing hello and welcome to the forum it sounds as though you have been really kind to your friend and given her some much needed support and so i can understand how upsetting it must feel to have her turn on you particularly when youve done nothing wrong  the fact that she waited to confront you and spent the evening acting as though nothing was wrong is a bit odd  have you talked to her about how it made you feel when she accused you of saying something unkind i suppose it might be difficult though particularly if youre correct and she is having hallucinations  years ago i had a friend who made accusations about me that were untrue and it was down to her insecurity shed make these things up just for me to reassure her that i liked her and we were still friends i wonder if shes not hearing voices if this might be what shes doing  without knowing her or hearing her version of events its hard to know whats going on in her mind and i can only really speculate is she getting any professional help at all  it may be that this is a symptom of her being unwell and whilst its difficult you mustnt take it personally i think that perhaps you are right whilst it might be upsetting for you friendship to end ultimately you have to look after yourself youve been very caring and loyal to her unfortunately her illness is affecting her thinking and way of relating to other people so its important to know its not personal either way hey its nice to see you popping back in im sorry that suicidal have come back and the reckless behaviour is not good  when you say that the suicidal thoughts have returned does that mean that initially the citalopram helped and they went away  as for the increase in dose its pretty much the same sort of timing of when you start a med you should notice an effect in a few weeks reckless behaviour might make you feel better but im guessing its only temporary  i dont think you should go on a booze and drugs bender because you could end up really doing yourself damage or getting in trouble i understand that might not be of great concern to you given that youre feeling suicidal but you might not feel suicidal forever    ten years down the line you might have a really happy fulfilling life and youll look back and think i wish i  didnt take those risks  did you try counselling at all i think i can vaguely remember you saying you tried but it was rubbish so you decided not to go ahead with it the reason i ask is because medication only does so much  if there are circumstances in your life making you depressed you can pop as many pills as you like but until certain issues are addressed you wont feel better for long is there anything in particular in your life that you think might be exasperating your suicidal feelings x its a pity you dont have access to help   is it that they dont have services like cbt in your area or have you just not been offered it   have you thought about getting selfhelp books i know there are so many out there that its hard to know which are worth the time and money but there are books that are particularly recommended  when i was part of a selfesteem cbt group the facilitators suggested that we read overcoming low selfesteem and it did really help me   as somebody who was bullied in secondary school but took college courses i can definitely understand your fears about being in that kind of environment again  but there are ways to cope   for instance i made sure i left classes a bit early or arrived a bit late in order to avoid the rush of people around the college who were finding their way to their next class  i also made sure that i went somewhere quiet or completely off campus during lunchtimes so that i wouldnt be disturbed   if colleges or universities know you have certain issues with anxiety in my experience they are generally quite accommodating and will do what they can to support you   of course ideally you wont need that support and youll be fine without it but it is there if you were to need it   finally i agree with melandcj and i think you have plenty to be proud of  youre strong adventurous ambitions sensitive  those are wonderful traits and innerbeauty like that never fades or grows wrinkly hope work and things went ok today jruth  also hope you managed to get some rest in spite of the bad anxiety  x aww im sure thats not true dreamer sometimes when were isolated it can certainly feel like nobody cares but other peoples lives can be very busy its not so much that they dont care or dont want to see you its mostly that people cant find the time  your therapists reaction to you mentioning this wasnt very helpful im surprised that they didnt explore this more with you i hope youre not too disappointed that the therapist didnt seem to listen you could always bring it up again next time and say that you found their previous response unhelpful though i guess that could be quite anxiety inducing  i really relate to your fears around this though i often find myself in a similar position where ive not spoken to anybody for days and it occurs to me that i could be lying dead for all anybody else knows and yeah its upsetting  i do think keeping busy is key  and trying to make new acquaintances so that perhaps you have more of an active social life and that might help lessen this anxiety a bit its really good that you found a group and as long as you dont completely wear yourself out i think its a good idea to perhaps look out for some more things to do  my only other comment is that i talk to my mum mostly every night unless im out or having a nap that it something that helps me feel more assured that someone would come looking for me if i didnt speak to them i know that sounds a bit depressing but i hope you know what i mean is there anybody you could speak to on the phone regularly hi and welcome to the forum what you describe does sound like anxiety  have you experienced this in the past or has this been since your deli closed im sorry to hear that you had to close it due to slow business by the way  can you identify if there is anything in particular that you are scared of when you go out  for example are you worried that someone you know might see you and want to talk to you  it sounds as though going from being very busy to spending a lot of time in your apartment may be making the situation worse sometimes it can be difficult to keep our minds healthy if we dont have something to focus on are there any activities that you would feel able to do that would help keep your mind occupied and build your confidence back up again it could be something simple like going swimming or visiting the library hiya im sorry youre struggling with withdrawal  it can feel really awful  are you reducing your medication as advised by a doctor im just checking because its important to follow correct instructions when coming off of a medication  as for the nausea it generally depends on what works for you some people like myself find that antinausea pills actually make nausea worse  its a good idea to make sure you are drinking enough water and stay hydrated make sure you eat enough  sometimes eating lighter meals more often makes peoples stomach more settled that three main meals a day  also ginger is known for having antinausea properties not sure if you like the taste of ginger but drinking ginger teabeer or eating some ginger biscuits might help  i hope that you start to feel better soon im glad you had counselling today but i agree that perhaps you should change doctors  its essential that they are there to get back to you when you need them particularly if youre having a rough time of things with the withdrawal and nausea   whilst they might not necessarily be able to give you any specific advice have you tried talking to a pharmacist about overthecounter antinausea remedies   i mean youd have to fill them in on whats going on with the lexapro and klonapin  that way they wont give you anything that could make things worse  but it might be an idea if youre really struggling this doesnt surprise me ive always felt that the benefits of antidepressants for anxiety have been slightly exaggerated whilst they have helped me in terms of social anxiety because i feel less inhibited when i take them i still get very anxious and im supposedly on an ssri that helps with anxiety citalopram  i dont really know what the answer is  obviously we cant all we walking around on benzodiazepines but for people who want to take medication i wish there were something a bit better for anxiety out there speaking from personal experience yes  lack of sleep makes my palpitations much more intense and much more frightening   i agree with nikkita that it would be a good idea to see your doctor and have an ecg just to check that theres no underlying problems its more than likely that what youre experiencing is anxiety related and nothing sinister but i really think its better to get checked over im sorry youve not had a response yet saf75  have you talked to a doctor about how you feel and how difficult it is for you to find the motivation to go out and about  it sounds like your days are very lonely and that in itself can make you feel very low   do you think that if you felt a bit better and were able to go out more it might make your life feel more meaningful   it must have been really painful to lose friends and family particularly as its left you so isolated and so i understand how tempting it must be to push your remaining friend away as means of protecting yourself and her  but it sounds as though she has really stuck by you through a lot and cares for you a lot and so i really think you should make sure you keep that connection going hey thanks for the recommendations  i find all of those things you listed help me too though its not always easy for me to find the motivation to exercise  having said that when i do exercise i love to swim though i tend to go to the ladies only session due to being selfconscious in a swimming costume   i find breathing techniques help too and i also recommend nature noises my personal favourite is my ocean waves and windchime track   interestingly ive found some tracks on youtube that are binaural beats and music layered on top of one another which are quite calming to listen to mind you i have to be a bit careful because it sometimes makes me feel like im floating away i do think that this is a fairly common thing for people not that that makes it any more comfortable for you   it does sound like you probably have an anxiety issue around it though particularly as this is something you say youre dwelling on quite a bit    i suppose if you dont have any religious or spiritual beliefs then the concept of death must be more difficult to accept   personally believing what i do and having the experiences that ive had has really helped me in this sense   the process of dying itself unless youre very unfortunate is not necessarily a painful thing a lot of people just pass quietly in their sleep or in some way unaware of whats happening and when youre gone well youre just gone arent you   have you shared your thoughtsfeelings around this with any professionals x i cant say ive had any experience of antibiotics triggering depersonalisation but thats not to say that it hasnt had that effect on you  i do wonder if it was maybe the sleep deprivation and im also wondering if the sinus infection has completely cleared up now personally ive found my sinuses can really impact my feelings of depersonalisation and derealisation if theyre blocked up or inflammed it makes me feel like im wearing a mask under my skin if that makes sense  i do think youre doing the right things  getting better sleep improving your diet exercising and supplements etc sometimes it can take a while before the body fully recovers especially if youve been really run down  i hope things improve for you soon if they dont it may be worth talking to your doctor about it all hiya stace  you said that things changed after a trip that meant youd spent 6 hours in a car  is that right  did anything else happen to change your feelings like an accident or anything   it seems like quite a change in behaviour and there doesnt seem to be an obvious trigger for it    i used to get lots of anxiety about travelling by car but to be honest my anxiety levels overall were high so it was really just one manifestation of how bad things were overall   do you find you are anxious in general too or is it very specific to travelling in a car how come youre being made to do this and you dont have a choice   whilst i think that pushing yourself sometimes to be out there in the world can help i do think it needs to be done in a way thats realistic and isnt going to be too overwhelming   i think blueflames suggestion of talking to your tutor and seeking out student support services is a really good idea   if staff are aware of your struggles things can be put in place to help you   sometimes there are quiet spaces or counselling services that colleges have that can be used if you feel like you just need some space and time for yourself coincidently ive recently read an article talking about the nocebo effect and it seems that it is as real as the placebo effect  if you believe something is causing you harm then sometimes that harm can manifest itself physically   but i do think the key is that it really depends on how much you believe it   i suppose its more difficult for you because this is happening in a dream where you arent consciously in control of what you are seeing    i dont think there is a lot a doctor could do i think that being medical professionals they are quite likely to take the stance that it cant hurt you and so you might need to be prepared for that   im wondering if you have any beliefs in things that might counteract what goes on in your dream  for instance i am a believer in healing crystals and so i keep an amethyst next to my bed because its believed to have properties of psychic protection  now i know that sort of thing isnt for everyone but it might be something to explore   also has anything in particular changed or been stressing you out in your waking life  unfortunately nightmares seem to happen more when were stressed out  which just doesnt seem fair because those are the times that we could do with a more restful sleep it sounds like youre really struggling with both your mental and physical health  its tough enough to deal with one of those but when youre feeling unwell in body and mind its really draining isnt it    do you feel like you are honest with your nurse im not doubting you at all i suppose it seems like its a strange thing for her to say when youre still feeling so low  being alive is not the same as living your life and as a nurse she should know that   i think the fact that the pills helped initially but dont work so well now shows that you would probably benefit from other approaches  have you asked your nurse about getting a referral to talking therapies   i dont know what there is on offer where you live but some mental health teams offer emotional skills type courses these arent really focused on talking about your problems they are intended to teach you some skills to help you cope better   the thing is if you wait for something else to be offered you could be waiting a long time  it is generally best to try and be assertive and ask for what you need so if you can be brave and have a conversation with your nurse it may well turn out that you would be able to get some more support oh jimny   to be phoned at lets face it such an unsociable hour and be drawn into such a negative experience is stressful enough and thats without adding on the fact that you could potentially get into trouble   im really sorry that you were disrespected and it sounds she may have taken advantage of the fact that you are a kind person who would help someone   i hope that the police see sense when they see you tomorrow and you dont get any more trouble  look after yourself in the meantime and remember that the forum is here if you need to  let off some steam or you need some support im sorry to hear that it sounds like people were very rude and unwelcoming so i can see why you dont want to try again deal with it what kind of advice is that    have you considered going to your gp and explaining that youve been given these diagnoses but dont feel youve been given enough information or support for them   i understand that things might not be so straightforward for you given that you had a brain injury but i think its appalling that you were told to simply deal with it without being given any guidance on how to deal with it i think both genders are affected and there are unique pressures for everybody i dont think you can really say who is affected more also i dont know if its helpful to say any particular gender has a more difficult time than others it could create a division which is never going to lead to any open or supportive interactions between genders i hope that makes sense it sounds like the anxiety in these situations are quite severe   the feelings and physical sensations you describe sound quite debilitating so it must be really difficult for you   does your wife know how bad you feel when she doesnt respond for a while have you asked her if she can type a quick message to say she wont be able to reply for a short while to reassure you   i suppose im wondering also why you im her while youre at work   in the kindest way it isnt something that people generally do either because theyre not allowed or they get too busy   did you set up the iming so that you could be reassured while youre at work    do you think youd cope if you didnt im her during your working hours and instead maybe called her during your lunch break for example   the thing is whilst i understand you find talking to her comforting i dont know if its not doing you more harm than good to be doing it during work hours  it possibly affects your concentration its definitely causing you anxiety and it may be that its not easy for her to be keeping up the conversation  i know that even with people im very close to i run out of things to say oh right  now that youve shared that it really puts your first post in context   im sorry to hear of both your own struggles and her struggles  sounds like shes had some very frightening experiences and so its understandable really that you would be concerned   sometimes i get a similar thing but its with my parents sometimes if i dont hear from them ill automatically think something bad has happened  what helps me in that situation is to look at the situations in the past where ive panicked  in none of those situations did anything bad actually happen your fears about her havent been proved right   i wonder if perhaps thats something that might help you you could even have a little mantra that you could say to yourself like my worst case scenario has never happened or my worry is unnecessary  all is well have you looked to see if there are any support groups or carers groups in your area  it might help to meet with other people who understand the challenges of having a loved one who suffers from mental health issues i think that mental health issues can wreak havoc with your natural flow of emotions   depression can cause you to feel numb and unable to process emotions which can at times make you feel a bit cold   other times it only takes something very little for the floodgates to open up and for a long crying spell to come  so whilst i appreciate that youve been struggling with anxiety and low mood this sense you have that youve lost some emotional ability is something thats quite common for people to get when they experience depression and anxiety   have you spoken to a doctor about these feelings or thought about seeking out counselling i think its a good idea to email your therapist and say you need to keep your next appointment  im sorry youre feeling to overwhelmed with things at the moment chick  with regards to the exams you can only do your best you may be surprised at just how well you do  it seems like youre thinking about a lot of what ifs and worrying about the future    i guess when i feel very overwhelmed with anxiety i focus on just one week at a time and if i find myself worrying about something thats not happening this week i distract myself with something else it might be worth trying something like that having a this week only rule for yourself yes i think id agree with you there and say that the feelings you have are down to anxiety it doesnt sound very nice to be living with at all so i hope the appointment with the psychiatrist went ok and you got some help hello and welcome to the forum   i have to say that at 20 it would be more surprising if you did know exactly what direction you want your life to head in especially careerwise im 25 and only have a vague idea that maybe id like to help people in some way maybe through counselling  ive had conversations with older people say in their forties and fifties and they tell me even they dont know what they want to do for a job they end up getting into whatever work theyre doing by chance and stay with it because theyre not sure what else theyd like to do  i guess what im saying is try not to put so much pressure on yourself to have everything sorted because realistically people spend their whole lives finding out who they are and what they want  i really understand how you feel in terms of looking into different careers but having anxiety hold you back for me i think what if i commit to that career and end up hating it i cant stand the thought that i wouldnt be able to cope now presuming you live at home and dont have too many bills to pay i would advise you to take advantage of college courses as much as you can you can never be too educated  when i was 20 i did an environmental conservation course ive since completed body massage im currently studying astrology and i do pottery all of those are quite different but having that experience of dipping my toe in through a course has helped me decide whats for me and whats not  it does sound a bit like your anxiety can get quite carried away  the example you gave about making someone worse if you were a physiotherapist  so i wonder if youve considered talking to your gp or if youve ever got help for you anxiety  another thing that helped me get out of my anxiety was to go out to places on my own id take a camera with me made me feel less selfconscious for being by myself and by taking pictures it made me stop and appreciate whats around me and go for a walk or visit a national trust property  so if you can find a relaxed activity to do that might interest you in an environment thats not too chaotic it might help build your confidence a bit ownership of what ive definitely experienced the angry feelings and the numbness but it was more depression related  though i guess anxiety and other mental health issues manifest differently in each individual   i just saw that you said you see a therapist and wanted to say yes  this is precisely the thing you should bring up with your therapist so you get hopefully get some more insight into hello and welcome to the forum   your post does make sense and youve come to the right place to vent as jimny said   can i ask what made you stop the online dating i think that you were very brave to try it and whilst i understand the reasons for joining a dating site are to hopefully get into a relationship i think the experiences you had were still valuable in some way   im sorry to hear about the job situation do you think that when you were made redundant that was when the anxiety came back   i suppose just from my own experiences of being chronically single its important to want a relationship for the right reasons and not see it as filling a void  right now im working on building a life that makes me feel content and whole while im single  that way i dont put so much importance or weight on a romantic partnership  there are lots of fulfilling experiences to had that dont involve having a partner so whilst it might get on your nerves and sound a bit of a cliche when your friends tell you to live your life for yourself i do think its an important point yeah supermarkets can be awful i usually go at a time when i know it wont be too busy  but yeah i agree with what youre saying cally if youre nearly there its always worth giving yourself that extra push to do whatever it is youre setting out to do hi and welcome to the forum  can i ask what you have in mind when you ask for a healing partner its not something ive heard before i presume its someone who you could go on a bit of a journey with to stop the trichotillomania i might attempt pancakes later fingers crossed theyll turn out ok i think it depends on what youre capable of doing  what i mean is a film can sometimes be good but other times i feel like i cant concentrate for the full duration of a film so its not a good idea to start watching one   my usual thing is to play free word games online its pretty good because it takes up your concentration and so your mind cant wander elsewhere  i like to go on pinterest too look at cutefunnyinspirational pictures  if im feeling lonely ill put the radio on so it feels like ive got some form of company   hope you find something that helps you anyway its a good decision to try and distract yourself  better to try and nip things in the bud than deal with a disaster welcome to the forum    im really sorry to hear that things are so difficult for you  you havent said where youve moved to but im guessing with needing insurance it might be the usa   im not entirely sure how things work out there but i hope your insurance gets approved soon because it sounds like you really could do with some support   the stuff with regards to your father is awful whilst i know that historical abuse cases carry lighter sentences i didnt know that victims could be treated so badly by not having their case brought to court at all that must feel pretty rubbish to be honest   did you find the counsellor youve been in the past year helpful at all  sometimes the counselling approach can be more helpful to people than therapy or at least thats the case for me  therapists seem to have an agenda whereas a counsellor is there to just listen   it may be that this time youll be able to find a more helpful doctor if medication hasnt helped you i guess youre not willing to really try any more   im just wondering if youre tried other things that might help  meditation setting small goals to achieve each day selfhelp books etc hey sev sounds like things are getting to a really bad point for you    when you say you think about suicide sometimes do you think youd ever act on it  if you ever feel like you might id suggest talking to a gp before doing anything to harm yourself   i know its tough and can feel a bit hopeless but things can change   whilst some people are against medication i have to say taking meds has really helped me in terms of my social anxiety i still get anxious yes but im able to actually have a conversation now and i dont feel so awful when im meeting someone new or find myself in a group of people  what im saying is it might be worth a try   i completely understand how upsetting the birthday thing can be when i was younger and had my more special birthdays 16 18 21 i think i cried on all of those occasions because i felt so alone and didnt have any friends to celebrate with  im 25 now i dont get as upset as i used to when its my birthday i suppose ive learned to relax about it a bit more and accept that my life hasnt been straightforward the fact i dont necessarily have friends to go out with is because of my anxiety and not that im not good enough in any way   anyway i can understand your reluctance but i would say that medication is something you might want to consider  also im wondering if you were offered any counselling at all sometimes that can be really helpful and help you in the longer term well obviously i wish youd stick around but look after yourself please  were not going anywhere if you change your mind and wanna come back im sorry to hear that people in your class are being unfriendly towards you   do you think they have already formed cliques and so its harder for you to make new friendships i wonder if their behaviour is more to do with them that it is a dislike for you not that im trying to invalidate you   i totally get that explaining your mental health issues is something that feels exposing but i dont think your making an excuse for yourself neither do i believe anybody else would think that  whilst i can appreciate the need to get on and live a regular life you do have to understand that mental health isnt something you choose so dont be too hard on yourself about it   i do think it would really help you to talk to someone at your college about it i bet you knew i was going to say that    that way you can access whatever services they have and you can have someone there to help you with this upcoming trip abroad   as for the trip itself its an incredibly courageous thing to do i think that in that situation it would be sink or swim  it could actually be really positive you might surprise yourself and really enjoy it   i suppose being aboard you dont have to worry over any embarrassing incidents because you wont ever see the people you meet again  this is why i love to do karaoke on holiday but never at my local pub  i dont care who judges me abroad ill never see them again   having said this you can always make yourself feel safer by making arrangements if things were to go pearshaped having funds to buy an early ticket home etc   i do think that having a member of staff or a student counsellor or whatever is available would help you in terms of getting emotional support and in terms of putting practical things in place to help you on your course and trip i woke up feeling alright actually  then got a bit pissy earlier  now im ok again huh they didnt mention your original charge    im sorry that theyve adjourned for another month what a pain in the arse  well done for making it i know youre probably wondering why you bothered but you did well to get there jellytots are you in the uk have you spoken to your local council about applying for social housing  another thought you could go into a womens refuge theyre not just for physical abuse theyre not just for abuse between partners  they accept any woman in an abusive situation in their home i went into one because of my brother and met another young woman in there who was escaping from her parents  its a big step and perhaps not something youd think about and thats ok but its always an option  you dont have to stay in that situation  the thing is even if your docs gave you the best counselling and the best medication if youre home environment isnt right youre not going to make a lot of progress crazy meds is a really good website for information on meds  it includes a what your doctor wont tell you section and lists pros and cons for a wide range of psychiatric meds its understandable that youre stressed  good luck for tomorrow i hope they dont keep you waiting as long as last time   gosh how to drag something out and make you anxious i agree with helena in that a talking therapy may be better suited for you seeing as the citalopram affected your concentration it may be that your university can offer this too   hopefully your doctor can help you if you make it clear to them youre not willing to take medication then theyll have to look at alternative ways to help hi and welcome to the forum   im wondering if there are any circumstances that are making you feel like this about the person i mean are they ill is there a reason for you to be concerned   im also wondering if youve had a falling out with this person that might sound like an odd question but ive felt this way when ive fallen out with somebody  perhaps due to an irrational fear that ill never see them again and not being able to come to terms with that   also do you suffer with anxiety and worry more generally   sorry to ask loads of questions its just your post is a bit vague is this to the tune of pop goes the weasel wishing you the best of luck for friday too   hopefully it can be sorted once and for all ah thats a tricky one isnt it you and i can clearly see that this certainly isnt a crime or abuse but im sure to your son this fear is very real i agree that the thing in wikipedia isnt really relevant in this hypothetical situation in your sons mind his intention wouldnt be to look at children its his fear that a child may accidentally look at him if hes revving his car  im really sorry i cant help you  im not sure what to suggest other than to keep reassuring him that his fears are precisely that  fears unwanted thoughts not reality not who he is as a person etc  perhaps someone else may reply with some better suggestions i wish you luck though and hope your son can overcome this anxiety not having a laugh in an unkind way  i very much agree with you the log cabin is very tempting yeah i think i know what you mean   i know that in order for me not to be triggered i need to avoid the news and certain websites  sometimes i get exposed to things that i have no control over  on social media for example you do see news stories etc that are upsetting due to people sharing them   anyway sometimes i foolishly click on something even though i know its going to be upsetting to me    ill read every comment on an article to either validate my view that the world is unsafe or to hopefully find people who are outraged actually i think for me thats a key point   sometimes its not simply the triggering article itself that i look at  its more important to see other peoples reaction because i depend on them for some kind of reassurance good or bad   as for why we do this to ourselves i have no idea its strange isnt it   i wonder if its because im so numb that feeling bad is better than feeling nothing i dont know though   im sorry that youre not feeling too good having looked at not nice stuff take care of yourself x i think this is very sensible actually  the trouble is facebook has been good for me in terms of finding out about events and spiritual workshops that i  otherwise wouldnt get to hear about so i need to weigh up the pros and cons with it really but yes  i know i need to avoid the news at all costs really warm wishes of a happy christmas to you too hi and welcome to the forum  im not a psychologist or any trained doctor so cant really give advice  ultimately if you are concerned it may be better to talk to a professional  i am wondering if hes had anything traumatic happen to him or if hes witnessed anything that may have deeply upset him because if thats the case id definitely make an appointment with a doctor to be safe it may also be worth considering seeing if you can find something like art therapy for him  i would say though that peoplechildren can be shy and anxious by nature that doesnt mean there are mental health issues nor that theyll develop mental health issues youve not said how old he is but this could just be a phase that hell grow out of  have you tried researching to see if there are any books that are aimed at parents of highly sensitive children  it might be worth looking for something along those lines i suppose ultimately it seems like he needs reassurance that everything is safe and encouragement to come out of his shell a bit more do you reckon  ive heard it said all fears can come down to a fear of death  not sure if i believe that because there are fears that i have that i cant link to death how did it go cally x ah cool  i like your new name and am glad this one has more positive connotations for you oh err  im so sorry you can change your settings to only get messages from contacts  which is what ive done  i presumed we were already friends but checked and were not anywho ive sent you a request so hopefully itll work now  oh and sorry its taken me a while to respond  not been online much today x all sounds very overwhelming   i suppose you already know that anxiety around exams is natural  but your experience of being able to feel other peoples pain is a lot to take   i mean it might not be your kind of thing but have you looked into things like psychic protection carrying a crystal or visualising a protective bubble around yourself can help you become less affected by other peoples stuff  oh and when are you due to see your therapist next is it long for you to wait   youve done so well to get through the last few weeks  i know youve had major struggles sorry you didnt sleep too well last night but just wanted to say that it was really good of you to use those selfsoothing techniques teanature stuffnetflix to try and help yourself  im sure the appointment tomorrow will go ahead as planned youre nearly there i know its been hard but help is near not sure if i can know a solution to give you i do want to welcome you back though just want to say im sorry youre on a downer family pressures can really affect you cant they im glad youre getting some money whilst youre going through the appeals process  that is a good sign  really hope you find the companionship you seek soon hey  its a tough one isnt it whether or not to see yourself as mentally ill  i think there can be this idea that to be mentally ill you must be really out of touch with reality etc but mental illness does include anxiety and depression   as far as the thoughts about hurting people id say that yes that does sound part and parcel of an anxiety disorder in fact i think intrusive thoughts can happen to those with various types of diagnosis   an anxiety disorder is an umbrella term a bit like mood disorder that refers to a group of disorders  so anything from agoraphobia to ocd would be considered an anxiety disorder  general anxiety disorder is just a specific type of anxiety disorder hope that makes sense welcome to the forum   i had similar thoughts to purple chaos  is your bedroom secure if not perhaps you could get a lock fitted there are practical steps you can take which hopefully can help you feel safer  locked door a little nightlight keeping a mobile phone with you in case you need to call the emergency services etc    i also agree with whats already been said about seeking counselling for yourself it could really help you   finally i am also wondering if youve considered seeing if there are any support organisations sometimes youll find carers support andor meeting for those affected by someone elses mental health issues it might be worth doing an internet search and seeing if anything like that is available in your area im sorry ive been totally crap at keeping up with this thread  but im dropping in now to see how you are hello and welcome to the forum   perfectionism and ocd are different obviously whilst im not up on what official definitions of each are i think its safe to say that things become an issue when they affect your life and your ability to function it seems to me as though youre at that point where its affecting you deeply  have you talked to a doctor about this it sounds like seeking support in the way of therapy may help it might also be worth seeking out any selfhelp material such as books or online cbt type courses welcome to the forum i have this issue but unfortunately i really dont have much in terms of advice being sensitive to noises seems to be quite difficult to sort out  i would ask if perhaps theres more going on underneath are you particularly stressed or anxious at the moment i find my sensitivity increases when im going through a stressful time sometimes also find it more difficult to tolerate a noise if a certain person that i dont like is causing them   sorry i cant be much more help can only really offer my sympathy on this one i use foam ones im intrigued  have you found better ones people can be such bastards and for no real reason other than the fact it gives them a sick sense of power i can imagine it would leave you feeling quite threatened  im really sorry you had this experience i know when things like this have happened to me its really played on my mind for the rest of that day at least its upsetting  i hope you get your drivers license soon in the meantime have you considered wearing headphones when youre on public transport it might drown the buggers out not me  my mobile phone is ancient thanks for the recommendation oh cally im sorry that this whole experience is even happening dont be too hard on yourself for not making it its totally understandable that the anxiety got out of control i know its hard but try not to think about it until april   really dont know a great deal about these things but do you have to be there in court for them to make a decision x  one of those things is enough to get you down but add them together and yep  that is a really horrid day    im pleased that your mum is able to help you whilst you make sense of the process you need to go through in order to get your benefits reinstated  but yeah not everybody has that luxury and it makes me so cross that theyre leaving people in such a situation   also well done for sorting out your heating could have been very easy to get overwhelmed and not act in that situation so all credit to you for getting it sorted   finally youve said yourself this person has never met you so try not to take her ignorance too personally shes obviously got issues of her own if she thinks its ok to be horrible to her friends on facebook   try and do something nice for yourself if you can make a cuppa and put your feet up  i hope tomorrow is a better day for you aww i hope youre ok   you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to but were here all the same  i see this thread is a day or two old but aside from my mental health issues im not marrieddont have kids and i dont intend on doing either of those things  for me im actually happier when i dont have any love interests in my life   and i know lots of very happy successful and wellliked people who are single and dont have children  so yes its definitely possible cherbear    am pleased to hear that things are still more settled than they have been sounds like youre making some good progress and its lovely to see or should i say read you sounding much brighter than you have in the past x i really feel for you   i had terrible acid reflux and ended up going to the out of hours gp because i couldnt stand it in the end i got prescribed medication for it   ice cold water yes i also found yoghurt helped soothe things a bit  also try laying down on your left  i dont quite understand precisely why that helps but its to do with where everythings located in your abdomen lying on your right hand side makes reflux worse and left hand eases it a bit   hopefully its just a bad episode and will ease of once youve got the stress of the court out of the way with  but i would consider seeing a gp   not sure if youre on meds but some medications quetiapine for me makes acid reflux really bad have you told a doctor about this i think if you havent already you should discuss this with a professional because there might be a physical cause  when you say you get it falling asleep are you starting to dream when this happens also how is your head positioned are the pillows too hightoo low no i dont think you sound younger   do you live close to him do you feel any physical threat  i do think that if things are getting worse or youre fearful for your safety it may be worth talking to the police   can i ask how you feel you get in trouble for setting boundaries is this disapproval from your parents or just from your brother   the thing is i have been and still am in a similar situation  the difference is my parents know how abusive he is because he abuses them too  but theyre really too scared to act because of what might happen if they were to say no more  i dont know what its like to be a parent i can only observe what ive seen from my own mum and dad but i think its incredibly difficult for a parent to admit that their child even if this child is a grown adult is abusive its so uncomfortable to contemplate that i think its far easier for them not to face the situation at all   whilst i can understand how much it must hurt to not feel supported or protected by your parents i really think that once you admit you wont be able to get whatever it is you seek from your family you can work on getting support elsewhere   are you still seeing your therapist by the way has she offered any suggestions on how to proceed in this situation cold water on the face  that helps me you must insist that you need an emergency appointment  if not call 111  i dont want you suffering without support  hope things get easier for you soon x i do think its important to keep in mind that the average person is pretty selfabsorbed and so any anxiety you have that people might be taking particular notice of you is probably unfounded i completely understand how it feels to be worried about people laughing at you or watching you and thinking somethings wrong with you but honestly the majority of the time people are in their own heads and taking no notice  it sounds like the apathy and feeling like nothing matters could be down to depression  from some of the things youve written it sounds like your selfesteem is quite low which again is another sign of depression  have you thought about seeing a doctor about this it really depends on the area you live in what services are available but i know in my area there are or were group cbt sessions targeted at a particular problem i attended one for selfesteem and found it really helpful not only was the content good but just going out once a week to a group where people understood how i felt was really useful i can relate to your fears and concerns about the mixing with people  as far as the job opportunity goes im not sure what to write because ive never worked   but i would say that perhaps you should start socialising in environments which are more quiet and nurturing to get used to people  something like an art class a library group a meditation group etc  things like that have helped me take care cherbear   hope you get some rest and find some peace lots of hugs your way x sounds like youre in a stressful situation with your father im sorry to hear things are so chaotic and that youre feeling so low   are you still seeing the crisis team are they any help  welcome to the forum by the way i say let the tears come  i agree with sprinkles in that crying can be very healing i think it would be sensible to tell your midwife to be honest   none of us here can give you the reassurance that the professionals can   and im sure shes got some experience of dealing with mumstobe that have come off meds and have mental health issues   as for the doppler thing there are so many reasons why you might not be hearing a heartbeat successfully does your midwife know you have one of these things perhaps she might be able to give you some good advice and help you find the right sort of place to be poking around with it well not poking around but you know what i mean chamomile tea lavender drops or spray on your pillow and bedding reading something before bed so your eyes get tired having a hot bath   just a few things that have helped me  good luck  hope you manage to get some good rest tonight oh blueberry sorry that things are really bad   please keep safe  i know youve harmed yourself but make sure to take care of yourself how are you sparkly im loving the optimism in this post cherbear  sometimes it can feel like youre destined to feel low forever but there is always hope   even being open to the possibility of hope is huge progress so well done to you sending you who are struggling strength and love  distraction eh sometimes its just so fucking pointless because you know youre still going to feel bad after youve watched that filmcompleted that crossworddone the disheshad a bath etc  i know its difficult but please keep at it x this is something i got very unwell with in my teens  i even went as far as believing that i could leave an imprint that could be read say for instance if i put my head on a cushion or pillow i was convinced someone could then later get a download of my thoughts from that oh and i thought there was a radio channel that everybody else had access too except from me which broadcast my thoughts  its was total nightmare and the angerfearanxietyconfusion i felt during those times were horrid i cant say what one particular thing helped me get better  but one technique i used to use was thinking something and seeing how someone reacted to test it out like if youre in a waiting room and someones wearing a tie id think youve got a big stain on your tie just to see if they looked at it because if they could hear my thoughts theyd be sure to check for the stain obviously this never worked  nobody ever reacted  and so gradually i started to accept the possibility that i was wrong ah cherbear im sorry things got more difficult i think its sensible to see a psychiatrist just to have that extra bit of support there for when things arent going good hey cherbear not sure how you are now since it says you posted this 15 hours ago  but this message seems fairly bright and just shows how lovely you are i hope that you are keeping well and i think its good to go awol every now and then just take some time for yourself whatever is right for you sorry that youre feeling this way are you at risk of acting on your feelings  also why do you feel bad that youve wasted a day it is a sunday and its ok to spend a day relaxing though it doesnt sound like youve had a lot of relaxation found this online   i hope that it gives you some reassurance  im sorry that youre having to deal with this anxiety i know it can be difficult to stop worrisome thoughts but trust me in that you wont be pregnant from this have you got any advice from a professional for this or tried any alternative techniques like hypnotherapy  this isnt something ive really experienced and so i dont feel i can give you any words of advice or wisdom but just wanted to send hugs anyway im just glad that we could reach you in some way i think your worries are understandable  in my opinion a lot of anxieties and issues seem to not truly go away but are replaced in other forms this is why its important that you get the support you need to address the root cause and also help you generally feel more relaxed and in control overall are you being seen to by any mental health staff in the hospital  i know you get embarrassed and its not easy for you to confide in people but i think this realisation youve had that youve always seemed to have some form of ocd is every reason for you to be 100 open and honest with professionals  hope that youre not getting too bored in hospital x cherbear    i know what that anguish is like and im sorry that youre having to go though it  its all the more reason to be nice to yourself though  you are a lovely human being with a big heart  it would have been tragic for you to have gone in the way you intended last night aww im really sorry to hear you got to that point of trying to take your own life  i know youve been struggling loads lately im so pleased to hear that youre still with us though    perhaps the fact theyve found underlying medical issues plus the fact that you acted on your urges might mean that youll get better treatment and support  i really hope so   oh and i know what you mean about other patients  there was an old lady with dementia shouting nonstop for her husband one time i was in hospital   i really hope you get a good nights sleep in fact get as much rest as you possibly can because your body will need it   please keep us updated ill be thinking of you x i think youre doinghave done the right thing by getting checked out physically its good to rule out any physical cause first but i think that mental health has a bigger effect on physical health than people realise   it sounds as though what youre experiencing is anxietyrelated i can relate to a lot of the things youve written i dont know if you ever suffer with depersonalisationderealisation but i get it a lot and it gives me the feelings of being lightheadeddizzylack of coordination its like i cant feel my feet at all  so as im sure youve probably worked out the more relaxed you are the less these symptoms will bother you if you can find relaxation techniques to help you when youre overwhelmed with these physical feelings then that would help even if its just taking yourself off somewhere you can be by yourself practise deep breathing and visualisation im so sorry that youre going through this i wish everyone in the world were free to  love who they wanted to without fear of persecution  i have to admit i feel a bit out of my depth trying to give you an answer because if you were to be who you are openly the consequences are potentially very bad however to live a lie could make you deeply unhappy  so emigration is definitely not an option for you  how would it feel to be single and not marry anybody would there be shame in being a single woman im really sorry that you selfharmed but im glad that you are in hospital where you can be looked after   perhaps it may be that its not comfortable to tell your family thats ok   im sorry if this has already been suggested but have you sought out counselling at all  whilst we are here to help and support you theres only so much we can do online and it sounds like youre in a really bad way and need facetoface support   i wish i could be of more help but hocd isnt something im familiar with and so all i can do is tell you that i sincerely hope you feel better soon hope that it all goes well and that its a gentle day for you x obviously youre not giving specifics so i can only answer in a vague way but id say yes  i think that essentially being starved of happiness and attention can make you a bit desperate for lack of a better phrase and cling on to things that you wouldnt necessarily otherwise value if you were happier and had other options as far as im aware as long as you dont link to commercial website trying to sell something and its more of a blog then its ok to share a link  this isnt necessarily part of forum rules but if any content could be triggering stick a warning on just in case i just wanted to say i hope the doctors are supportive and can help you ive got similar issues and suspect fibromyalgia but the doctors never really acknowledge things  they do tests xrays blood tests but as they all come back clear nothing gets done  try do to what you can in terms of managing things yourself painkillers hot baths hot water bottles sportsbandage type things for ifwhen your ankle plays up etc i agree with jruth in that practising breathing exercises and focusing on your breath in a mindful way may help out   you havent had a cold or anything that would explain why these feelings have been back the last 2 weeks  perhaps it could have been the stress of christmas and new year am only speculating though   the fact that you were ok at your gym session probably shows that this is anxiety rather than you being unfit or having any physical problems   if its any consolation i get this a lot too  similar to what jruth described  a lot of the time i dont realise how shallow my breath is until i find myself taking a big gasp for air out of the blue i urge you to reach out and tell someone professional that you are suicidal and that you have plans and nearly went through with them   im also wondering if they know you have selfharmed which by the way is nothing to be embarrassed about you are low and it was some way of coping with your innerpain   please please please tell someone in real life you are feeling this way   do you live alone  if you do do you feel there is anyone you could stay with or invite to stay with you while youre feeling vulnerable and have these plans  if you dont live alone perhaps reach out to whoever it is you are living with and explain youre unwell and need some support you dont need to tell them all your business if you dont want to  its just important that people around you are aware that youre really going through the shit at the moment   it might seem like its not worth telling anybody what the point etc but i can assure you people would rather know youre having these kinds of struggles now than when its too late hi and welcome to the forum  how long have you been on the citalopram for also who prescribed it  a gp or a psychiatrist  i do think medication helps but is generally limited in how much it can help  in order to make things easier in the long run its usually best to have some kind of talking therapy andor learn selfhelp skills  i know that doing a lot of selfdiscovery reading selfhelp books seeing a counsellor and generally trying to be aware of my thought patterns to identify thinking distortions as they happen has helped me what if something is wrong what if you have an illness such as a depressive or anxiety disorder which can be treated  people do recover and have happier times lifes never going to be wonderful all of the time of course not but you can learn to identify what parts of your thinking are caused by an illness and what parts of you are still you i dont think you should feel bad or like you let yourself down the principle of your actions i say were right racism is unacceptable and dickheads like that who think its a laugh to be so flippant about it do need to be told  if you dont normally act like that i understand that it can be a shock for you too i know on the rare occasions that ive got angry or even just politely defended myself my heart is practically in my throat and im shaking like a leaf because its so unusual for me to be anything other than silent  in answer to your question though yes  irritability is definitely connected to anxiety think about it the anxiety is putting all of this adrenaline around your system and is giving you that physical fight or flight response its understandable that every now and then the fight will win  i get terribly pissy inpatient and intolerant sometimes it comes on out of the blue but i know its because im feeling very overwhelmed and physically pumped up if that makes sense x welcome to the forum  would you say you have anxiety issues in general or that its more your situation with your daughter thats the issue how is she feeling in all of this  is she happy i dont know what its like to be a parent but i can imagine that it must be very difficult at times and that you just want to see your baby happy however as im sure you know theres only so much you can do and you dont really have any control over this situation worrying wont change anything it will only cause you to feel stressed out  it may be worth looking into why you feel so consumed by the worry about your daughter whether you feel there are other issues in your life that are overwhelming you too oh viktoria   i have had episodes of crying hysterically and screaming for hours on end  it wasnt nice  but a panic attack has never lasted so long for me    you must be absolutely exhausted i really hope you can get some rest to make up for last night  if you havent had the opportunity to tell a professional about this i think you should   whilst prn medication such as a benzodiazepine can be addictive and are not a longterm solution you should have something with you to take the edge off in case something like this happens again its frustrating that youre not being offered help especially as youre acknowledging your problem and wanting help  is the reason youre not wanting to do the group therapy because youre scared of what other people might think if so there are rules and confidentiality agreements i know its easy me saying that but it might be something that could support you  are you in a financial position to seek your own help  i go to a lowcost counselling clinic and its helped me more than quite a few nhs workers ive had am glad you had second thoughts so i gather your little sis doesnt live with you is there anything you can do to help you distract yourself when your boyfriend is away  im really sorry that the voices are bad and are dragging you down so much hope that things ease off for you soon x it does sound like you are overthinking and perhaps driving yourself up the wall with worry i do think rasselas is correct in that it seems as though you need to have a bit more confidence in yourself obviously i cant make generalisations every woman is her own person in the same way every man is his own person but i would advise you to just keep on communicating honestly and openly with your girlfriend share your feelings with her and be open to whatever she wants to share  im sorry i cant be any more specific or helpful i wish you the best of luck with the situation though im ever so sorry to hear that you are struggling so much especially with your new baby   postnatal depression must be so difficult   i think that it may be worth trying to get your prescription if you can you never know it might help you  also remember to keep communicating with your doctor or health visitor   you are unwell and so remember you have no reason to be ashamed for what you are thinking and feeling   the most important thing is that people who are around you know how you feel on a daytoday basis and can be there to give you extra support merry christmas to you too clive not sure what advice to give  but wanted to say i know exactly how you feel   im struggling a lot with this at the moment  sometimes i feel like im about to die its really not nice   just try to relax when you can and get plenty of rest   hope that things improve soon it may be the hyperactivity and business surrounding christmas and new years thats making things particularly difficult at the moment at least thats what im trying to tell myself im sorry to hear you had a bad day too  were here if you want to talk more about it  am hoping that things get better soon i think theres some statistic that says 8090 of things we worry about never happen  i can relate to what you might be experiencing im full of anxiety and fear at the moment due to the situation going on with my family obviously its different circumstances but i totally understand the worrying is enough to drive you up the wall  try to keep that fact in mind and know that your worst fears are very unlikely to happen     am sorry that i cant say anything more helpful sending love though oh thats wonderful news   im really pleased for you big congratulations to you hi sandyp  i havent actually seen this forum user post for a while so chances are you might not hear from her  im sorry to hear that you share the same struggle  it must be incredibly difficult and create a lot of anxiety   so did you have an incident which triggered this all off  are you managing to eventually eat enough at the moment   i would suggest seeing a doctor and asking for some therapy or counselling to explore this anxiety in hopes that it might help you move forward sorry to hear youre struggling with this  i get a similar thing and there doesnt seem to be an obvious explanation for it   do you keep a diary am wondering if perhaps you might be able to identify a trigger if you write things down though sometimes these things dont always have a reason   the thing i do when im overcome with fear and anxiety is to remove myself from whatever situation and retreat   spending time on my own gives me that space to regather davey is right they are intrusive thoughts and a lot of people have them  i understand how completely distressing they are because i get them myself from time to time   unfortunately theres no real way to stop them you can do your best to adjust your thought pattern when they come up so that you are selfforgiving and know that its no reflection on who you are as a person  are you generally quite stressed out and anxious taking steps to be more relaxed overall might help them not crop up in the first place im not entirely sure what to say as this isnt something ive experienced  perhaps when your throat infection clears up you might start to find it easier   is it swallowing everything or just food i wonder if stuff like soups are ok just wondering if youll be ok to get enough nutrients    it might be worth going back on your meds if this continues on and is causing you to worry    also wanted to say that there are lozenges you can get that anaesthetise your throat i know there are some specifically for people who sing for example theres also a spray you can get  mind you i dont know if that would help because it is an odd sensation when youve used these products   wishing you well anyway hope that you can get this sorted x i agree with purple chaos  it would probably be a good idea to see your gp or someone who can help at your college such as a counsellor   id imagine though that the approach they may try is one thats down the route of cognitive behavioural therapy  there are selfhelp books out there on the subject that can be quite helpful though of course theyre no substitute for a professional working alongside you   if you dont already my advice would to be to break big tasks down into smaller ones  rather than tackle the whole thing in one go do a bit then take a break it might help im sorry to hear about your situation  its sounds really difficult and probably all the more stressful given the time of year   solicitors are a pain in the arse my parents tried to sell the family home last year and it feel through needless to say my mother ended up calling the guy a useless prick   i really hope the domestic abuse advisor is someone you feel comfortable talking to  i have had an experience of going to a womens refuge myself and i cannot praise the staff who worked with me enough  remember that may well be an option if it gets to a point where you cant take any more   eventually when youre living on your own i do think that how you feel will improve   it may be worth thinking about getting some counselling once your settled to help you move forward from such a crap experience this isnt a disorder at all in my opinion  you are struggling with some very deep emotions and circumstances the fact shes been diagnosed with cancer are almost forcing you to face your feelings  whilst it must feel very painful for you in my opinion youre not mentally ill   i think its natural that youd feel her pain and that you wish you could make her feel better  however i do think that its important for you to focus on other things and to not allow this situation to take over   there may be a danger of becoming a bit obsessed with her and feeling unhappy unless youre in contact with her which could result in you feeling very hurt   i was wondering if youd considered counselling at all i think it might help you to talk to someone and also to have somebody else there to help you keep focused so that you dont neglect other areas of your life welcome to the forum im glad youve finally posted    obviously nobody here can diagnose but i relate to your post and from my experience it sounds as if you could be getting depersonalisation or derealisation  when i get it it feels like my awareness is outside of my body it makes me dizzy uncoordinated and i feel like i cant feel my feet  it is worrying but its also recognised as a thing that people have so its nothing to be too concerned about  unfortunately there is no cure for it the reason it happens is usually when youre overwhelmed either with depression or anxiety or any other mh issues  the more you relax the better it generally can be   though i know thats easier said than done because the depersonalisation makes me anxious the anxiety causes depersonalisation its a vicious circle   one thing that helps is to just constantly reassure myself in my mind that i am physically healthy and what im feeling is the result of anxiety  and it will pass   hope that helps a little bit yes  ug has a good point i forgot to ask how long youve been on citalopram for i take it still now but i remember the first few months on it i felt very spaced out and strange i can definitely see how this could be the case some people who are very happy seem to be a bit dim i find that when im depressed my mental functioning goes downhill big time i cant concentrate i cant remember anything and i genuinely just feel like my brain has been replaced with mush dont underestimate how much it can affect you  if you havent been diagnosed with a learning difficulty or had extra support when you were in school as a child i wouldnt think thats the issue because schools are quite good at picking up on that sort of thing  i dont necessarily think that theyd teach you separately they might provide you with extra information when i did a course at college the tutor printed off the slideshows for me because sitting in the classroom and staring at the screen i found it hard to concentrate i also found the pace too fast so it was hard to make notes it might also be an idea to make notes too if you dont already i also take shortterm prn medication lorazepam but thats definitely not a long term treatment as its highly addictive its more emergency only   just wanted to ask for clarification  has this only started happening since the citalopram sorry am just a bit confused hope you sleep better tonight  ive not had a great deal of sleep lately either its difficult when your minds racing lets hope tonights different clive if you phone up the dwp and tell them that your appeal letter will be late due to your gp surgery not being able to fit you in until the 6th jan then they will take that into account and extend the deadline my cpn was away on leave when i needed a form filling in and so i phoned the dwp and they allowed me to send my form in late obviously services will very depending on where you live but the citizens advice should be able to help you out too also just want to say im so sorry that your benefits have been stopped thats the last thing you need when youre ill  and at this time of year it must be all the more upsetting sometimes i can feel my pulse in my throat  i know that must sound quite unusual to some people but i notice it particularly when ive been doing some strenuous exercise or if im really anxious  ive found that drinking a glass of water and deep breaths can help shift the feeling  while its easier said than done id try not to think too much about it particularly as your doctors have said that you are in good health sorry youre feeling sad how come your friends are annoying you do you think its because youre not feeling well that theyre getting on your nerves sometimes its difficult to be around other people when you feel low im sorry your friend said that to you it sounds as though shes not very supportive of you hi cazmorty153  welcome to the forum i hope you dont mind me saying this but can i make a suggestion that you start a new thread and repost this its just that i dont know how many people will see your post tucked away here and a new thread specifically for you is likely to get more response x im glad you spoke to your gp and got some help  fingers crossed youll start to feel better soon i was having similar thoughts to dubblemonkey  a metallic taste in the mouth can be the result of quite a few different medications have you been on any new medications lately  in some cases a dryness in the mouth can lead to a metallic taste  i wonder if you were hyperventilating particularly badly during this experience and that might have caused it  i would say also that perhaps the next time you see a doctor mention it to them not saying that to worry you  i just think someone with medical knowledge will be able to give you a better idea of whats going on and may be able to provide a more reassuring explanation welcome back  what kind of side effects are you experiencing yes it does sound like anxiety to me i get the same symptoms and just like you said sometimes they just come out of the blue  i can be sat down minding my own business and suddenly ill be aware of butterflies in my stomach and my heart beating erratically its odd i think its important to reassure yourself that theres nothing physically wrong though sometimes im convinced im about to have a heart attack but i have to just keep reminding myself its only the anxiety  have you spoken to a counsellor at all about losing your mum do you feel youve properly grieved am asking as you said that your mothers death seems to coincide with all of these physical feelings happening x stress is a killer if it doesnt result in a mental disorder itll probably affect your physical health in some way its why i think a whole lot more needs to be done to reduce stress in order to prevent these illnesses from happening in the first place ocd isnt something ive struggled with so dont have much insight to share  but i do experience things similar to what youre describing the false memories  sometimes it can get really difficult to distinguish between reality and whats gone on inside the mind  also when things feel so real and are so specific a part of me almost thinks its some great psychic insight or premonition which makes ignoring the thought more difficult   do you practise grounding exercises much it might help you feel more in reality and as a result perhaps youll be more confident in knowing whats really happened  the 5 things for 5 senses thing is really good so for example you focus on 5 things you can smelltouchseehear taste isnt so easy in the moment youre in   i hope things get better for you soon anyway i definitely agree that if you want to be healthier its best done in steps im pretty sure ive seen some research this was years ago so dont ask me to find the source which says that youre more likely to be successful in improving your health if you focus on one issue at a time im sorry i havent replied sooner  i have no experience of day hospital at all so didnt feel i could say anything helpful i do hope its gone well for you today though let us know how you got on if you get a chance experiences like that really unsettle me too my startlereflex is really strong  sometimes its the smallest noise that will set my heart rate off the scale so yeah you have my sympathy some people just arent very sensitive at all are they  please dont fee like a failure in my opinion it was his social faux pas to say that to you so if anything he should be feeling bad  try not to let this affect you you are unwell and its often difficult to see old friends and have to explain to them why youre not working or whatever hey  im not entirely sure what your situation is or whether youre in trouble or giving evidence  have you told someone youre not fit to attend  i wouldnt take too much propranolol but im sure if it helps it wont matter if you take a bit  sorry i cant be more helpful as i said im not entirely sure whats going on for you and so wouldnt want to say something wrong its really difficult having anxiety i despise going to any normal shops to buy shoes or clothes they always seem so busy   i use jd williams though that is classed as a womens clothing site  if you type in free returns with a search for wellies it might produce some more results if youre stuck for places to look oh i hope you find a decent pair soon  when i used to walk the dogs daily my wellies broke and i did the plastic bag thing its a nightmare x i think its quite a common symptom of anxiety its something i get a lot and have had it for as long as ive had anxiety 10 years  if youre quite stressed or anxious in general that feeling of needing to take a breath can come and it can seem out of the blue  when i get it i think that perhaps somethings going on on an unconscious level so im not 100 aware of just how anxious i am  im not sure if trying for a big breath makes things better or worse  ive not seen anything that says either way from personal experience sometimes when im feeling breathless and im doing breathing exercises i do find my pulse goes faster when im trying for a big breath which can make things worse because essentially it makes me want to breathe more  i think its about trying to find a balance breathing as you need to when youre anxious and then focusing on deep breathing when things are calming down a bit  hope that makes some sense x since its a one off i wouldnt be too worried you said yourself that youre really stressed at the moment and its understandable that your dreams are reflecting that high anxiety see how it goes and if this happens again its easier said than done im quite a serious person by nature im not really a person someone comes to for a laugh im generally seen as sensible and sensitive in real life i this is im happy to prat around on the forum  they say to ask yourself will this matter a year from now i think trying to gain some perspective about how important something really is in the bigger picture can help x i agree with purple chaos   i admit ive said hurtful things to people in the past when ive been in a bad way and i have regretted it it is common to lash out   i know its hard when someone says something horrible to you even if you know logically that you shouldnt take it personally it doesnt take the hurt feelings away   try not to think about it too much or beat yourself up its not true x i think thats only true to a certain extent being highly emotional doesnt make for truth always the fact that they apologised shows that they didnt mean what they said and still want your friendship i think gajolene is right in that these things are very individual also personally i think it can depend on the type of anxiety youre struggling with  antidepressants have helped me a lot in terms of social anxiety im still an introvert still dont like being the centre of attention but i dont have that crippling embarrassment whenever i say something i found that the antidepressant im on citalopram has really helped me loosen up in social situations however when it comes to things like assuming the worst case scenario when i dont hear from someone catastrophising it hasnt helped a great deal  just my experience anyway if you do decide to give it a try i hope that it helps x agree with others here you should definitely talk to a professional  my personal experience of lorazepam is that it can actually make you feel really weird very depersonalised paranoid and freaked out  of course everybody reacts differently to medication but its not uncommon for lorazepam to make peoples mental health worse ironic i know   i think a doctor would help you get properly sorted if you need help sleeping there are medications they can prescribe that have sedating side effects which you could take at night providing the medication would be of use to you there are certain antidepressants like mirtazipine that can help insomnia just wanted to welcome you to the forum and say im sorry you had such a frightening experience  i suffer from depersonalisationdissociation sometimes and the disorientation that it can cause is quite scary  the trick is to try to relax i know its not easy but the more stressed out you are the more likely these experiences are going to happen   i dont see any harm in taking supplements even if you have health anxiety you might notice that you feel better not sure if youre uk based but i remember reading a statistic that says most people in britain are vitamin d deficient due to the lack of sun we get   i would have a word with any professionals working with you about the incident on the bus its better that they know x absolutely and you cant put a time frame on moving forward from something like this  just because its been 2 years doesnt mean that youd be any less affected by it particularly if youve not had support in dealing with the painful emotions left behind  im not a psychiatrist obviously so cant really say whether relationships cause stress disorders from my personal opinion though id say yes  they definitely do  have you sought any help for things it sounds like youre dealing with a lot of unpleasant emotions  betrayal trauma deceit etc i really think you would benefit from therapy or counselling if thats an option for you at the moment hey dan you shouldnt feel ashamed or like a let down i dont know if that shame comes from comparing yourself to other people or thinking about how you should be but just remember that everybody in life is on their own path what one person can do without a second thought is actually a huge victory to someone else also it actually sounds like youve made some really big progress over the years  from my experience 1  i take really deep breaths i imagine that im trying to blow up a balloon with the fewest breaths possible  really use up as much of my lung capacity as possible and count eg inhale count 1 2 3 4 hold count 1 2 3 4 exhale count 1234 rest count 1234 also i find putting my hands on a flat surface helps to steady me a table is best but a wall can work too then i just focus on putting one foot in front of the other walking slowly to the bathroom and putting some cool water on my face i think that in time you will be able to make your own little ritual like the one i mention above  but hopefully you can try out what helps me to enable you to see what works for you  2  the absolute worst that can happen is youll pass out but its really unlikely because anxiety is actually doing the opposite ie pumping too much blood around you than what happens when you faint ie not enough blood if you did pass out im sure people around you would be incredibly sympathetic honestly i think the majority of people arent unkind and if they were to witness you having an anxiety attack they would just want to help  3  yes once i asked a man if i could lean against him because i thought i was going to topple over he kindly helped hold me up and asked me if i was ok if there was anything i can do and it passed as i said i think most people would be more than happy to help as long as they werent in a hurry to get somewhere  i think the more you can go out and have positive experiences the easier things will become i used to hate going out on my own wouldnt go anywhere with my parents but over the years ive had some really rewarding and happy times when ive been out alone  and now i love my independence i have this problem too  i remember one time when i was 11 there was a big stain on my chair in class to top it all off i was known as the only girl who had started her period i got asked if the stain on my chair was me coming on my period   but you know what the next day it was completely old news and nobody mentioned it again   i understand this may be hard to believe but i am pretty sure nobody will say anything to you they have probably forgotten all about it already  even if they thought about it afterwards im sure they understood that in that kind of heat is was bound to be sweat  its a natural bodily function   perhaps in future you could just be quicker to put your chair under the desk but honestly i doubt its necessary id be willing to bet you werent the only one who had sweat stains on their chair you were just too fixed on your own situation to notice anybody else x im pleased you were checked over and that nothing too abnormal that would have required you to be in hospital was found  also well done for getting over to the doctors thats a big thing    hope you start to feel better soon anything odd going on with your heart is frightening isnt it x that is a good tip anything involving deep breathing and walking it out sounds good to me welcome to the forum too  x it sounds a lot like a panic attack to me im sorry youre experiencing this panic attacks can be really frightening and they often come on out of the blue i know the advice of doing breathing exercises is a bit overdone but if you can just focus on your breathing it might help sipping water gently might help too  if this happens again i would talk to your doctor because they might be able to recommend something to help you in the long term x i have eczema that is brought on by stress anxiety or emotional upset its very annoying x ah ive got some prescribed cream betnovate and while that usually helps it seems the hot weather is making it worse glad youve found something that provides some relief        originally posted by khuang   i also use cortisone but mine seems to be both environmental and stress related if i keep getting my hands wet my skin gets irrated and also when i am pushing myself too hard to keep up with stuff over a period of time my eczema just flared up a bit which i suspect is due to the stress of moving its not as nearly as bad as a few other outbreaks only have one cut associated to it this time around and it isnt on the knuckle either which isnt very common for me   you have my sympathy  i get both wet and dry eczema the dry eczema on my hands i get in the winter its very painful when your knuckles open up like cuts i remember someone asking me if id punched through a window when it was really bad a few years ago not the impression i want to make on people  x make sure you have something nice ready to treat yourself afterwards because its obviously a stressful thing for you and you deserve a reward for when youve gone through with the appointment  even if its just a nice bar of chocolate and a glass of wine x when i had my little bike i used to love the feeling of being out too  nice weather close to the nature wind blowing my cares away so yeah i can relate   currently the only thing that chills me is being in the sea i like being at the seaside but sometimes when its hotbusy i get a bit angsty however when im in the water the business on the shore seems to far away and i feel held by the ocean x it was just a little 125 yamaha sr i loved it though  and i agree secluded spots by the beach are better thats one of the reasons i like swimming in the ocean it gives me that sense of a vast open space around me x i was first referred to a psychiatrist 2 months before my 13th birthday  im 24 now and while i still have my issues i can relate to your situation   i just want to say that i think the key thing is to take things one small step at a time  i think its great that you want to go to uni and i wouldnt discourage that at all  however i know when ive had big plans theyve just been too big and ive ended up getting too overwhelmed and backing out  ive achieved far more when ive done something i know i will be able to manage and stick to like a college course thats one evening a week  i think that slowly building up your confidence by doing little activities and gradually increasing them will be a better way forward rather than throwing yourself in at the deep end x im sure everything will be ok when youre at home by yourself  you have dogs for company from what youve said and they can be really reassuring  obviously you have good common sense and you know what to do to keep the house safe   it might be good to keep communicating with your family through texts if you can   although having said that i suppose they have to be camping somewhere where there is good signal   oh and the what are you doing question is such a pain in the arse isnt it i know its supposed to be light chit chat but it isnt half annoying  x i know its not quite the same as hearing the voice of a loved one but do you ever call any helplines  sometimes it helps just to have a voice on the end of the phone especially if youre worried you might harm yourself x its understandable that you got triggered  im sorry that that happened though   zoeyz is right it might take a while before you stop feeling so unsettled by seeing him particularly if there is unresolved trauma around the way he treated you  just try to reassure yourself that you are safe now and take it easy look after yourself x peacewithin has made some really good points  i only really want to say that i can relate to feeling really clingy when im anxious  trouble is i dont have anybody to cling to  personally i just feel like a really upset little girl who needs a cuddle and some reassurance   i think thats the key really isnt it you just need some reassurance  however it sounds like no matter how much your partner assures you everything is ok you still worry which makes me think that you need to work on some selfsoothing  i always try to say some comforting words to myself when im having a bad time you might do that already but if you dont try just saying im safe its alright soandso name of person youre worring about is fine nothing bad is going to happen etc x aww im sorry to hear youve been having such a bad time of it  glad to hear you rang nhs and they checked you over and that its nothing too serious   you were lucky sometimes trauma to the head can be dangerous and you dont even know somethings wrong until a few days later  take care of yourself  x it is quite normal to have a reaction when you start medication how are you feeling now if it was a bug it might have passed i would imagine its the meds even though you dont recall having that reaction when you were last on them i know sometimes it can feel disheartening to go back on medication when youve spent time successfully without them but it doesnt have to be forever its best just to help yourself whilst youre having a rough time rather than try and struggle without help x welcome to the forum im pleased to hear that you have moved out and although finances are tough you dont have to put up with being treated like that any more x hey sapphire can you identify what the reasons are behind your fear of falling asleep recently ive been plagued with nightmares and i know that thats contributing to a lot of bedtime anxiety for me at the moment but having said that i have a more chronic long term fear around sleep and for me its do with being vulnerable and open to attack whilst im asleep  logically i know its not going to happen but i cant help but feel like when im asleep someone is going to come in to my bedroom and do something bad to me  the reason i ask is that if you have some idea of the fear around sleep it might be easier to find solutions that help you ease the fear slightly  a few general tips from me that have helped me  drinking chamomile tea using lavender pillow spray or lavender oil making a bed time charm  maybe a dream catcher or small herb pillow  something to give you some psychological reassurance even if it is a placebo effect using a nightlight or keeping the hall light on checking all doors are locked and windows closed before bed a fan next to my bed blowing cool air over me helps with my breathing if i get too anxious blocking out noise with earplugs making sure the temperature is right keeping the bedroom simple and a natural soothing colour buying nice pillows cushions throws etc to make your bed as comfortable as possible  if you can get your sleeping environment to be calming it can help also if you dont already do this then keep the bedroom for sleeping only dont watch tv or take your computer in your bedroom its better for your brain to associate the bedroom with rest x yeah dont be too hard on yourself about it  you dont need to feel stupid and statements like i should be able to deal with this are unnecessary  i think its understandable that you got stressed out particularly as he arrived pretty much unannounced  you were caught offguard and as crumpet said you actually handled the situation well   oh and just as an aside  i never offer people doing work whether its on the boiler or other maintenance stuff a cup of tea i know im a bad hostess p x im surprised that you left and im sorry i havent noticed sooner i hope that you come back but of course only if you really want to if you dont then i wish you all the best and hope life brings you some reasons to smile take care x sorry to hear about this experience coming up  sounds unpleasant all around really  ive never had to have that so i cant really say how it tastes or not  but my advice is to drink it as quickly as possible and to also hold your nose if you are allowed a mint like tabbykitten was thats probably a good idea too  you never know it might not be as bad as you think i hope that it all goes well x i dont know if this is anything similar but i took movicol regularly several years ago because i was err  a bit impacted sorry  tmi  it really didnt taste of anything at all i prepared it with squash and it just made the water feel more silky had i not have prepared it myself i wouldnt have noticed   so if theyre a similar thing then in my opinion you neednt worry too much because its not even that noticeable x welcome to the forum sara mirtazipine is a bit of a funny medication choice  did you say you were having issues with sleep to your doctor or are you on any other medication its not always the first choice of medication at least not in my experience it can make you groggy and there are other antidepressants that work on anxiety too that have less side effects im pleased that you are going to make an appointment with the gp if things havent improved at all then its no good for you to be struggling to get by on your own cbt can be useful i do find the principles of it helpful but i think you need to have a certain amount of motivation to start with if that makes sense though thats just my opinion you might find it really helpful and if its on offer to you youve got nothing to lose by going to the sessions it can feel a bit odd talking to a stranger but on the other hand it can be a good thing because its all confidential and the therapist has no attachment or relationship to you sometimes its difficult to talk to loved ones about things because there is a risk of upsetting them but with a therapist you can be assured that nothing you say is going to shock or hurt them x i dont really know what the medical term for this kind of behaviour is either but i can relate to what youre describing  it could be a result of other kinds of problems like depression psychosis mood disorders etc or it could be the anxiety suddenly rearing its head   i find it a really upsetting experience its like in my mind i just want peace and to chill out but my emotional and physical body has other ideas its like every cell is fighting with the one next to it the agitation is too much sometimes i end up laughing hysterically at whatever is angering me but i always end up in tears eventually  its so difficult   i presume theyll want to find out a bit more about you and possibly do some exploring to see if it is linked to anything else like bipolar   depending on the conclusion im guessing youll either be put on an antidepressant that has offlabel use in anxiety or possibly even an antipsychotic  i dont know  i hope that you get some help with this though i understand the experience and its horrible x im on citalopram and quetiapine but those meds arent so much related to these episodes i do have prn medication meaning you dont take it daily only when you really need it of lorazepam and i find that they do help me calm down in these situations particularly when i feel im at risk of hurting myself its good that you have told your therapist hopefully in the upcoming sessions you can talk through it x lorazepam is pretty fast acting personally its been more affective for me than valium theyre addictive and not meant for long term use i try to be as stingy as possible with how often i take them but they do help x just wanted to say that i appreciate how nervous you must be ive taken journeys on a train alone approximately 4 times and whilst it does get easier i do find that i dont fully relax on the journey i only briefly went on a virgin train from crewe to chester which was probably less than half an hour but it the train seemed in pretty good condition  reasonable amount of room easy to get to the loo decent size toilet as a plus size i hate loos that are too small  no room to swing a rats arse oh and some trains have a quiet carriage specifically for people who dont want to be around obnoxious people making phone calls etc  i hope that others here have helped assure you that youll be ok  because you will be ok x you have the air conditioner on and your mother doesnt want you to sorry i got a bit confused reading your post x so do you find the air conditioner helps drown the sound out or is it that it helps your breathing when you are anxious i get very easily startled by noises too even a little sound like a door slamming shut can send me into a huge panic and i get scared im having a heart attack i understand where youre coming from i find that listening to music through headphones has helped me a lot although that means that sometimes you dont hear people approach and so theres a chance that you might get a bit jumpy if someone suddenly appears is your mother understanding about your anxiety x sorry to hear youre feeling this way  just wanted to say that youre not alone though i can relate and im sure others here can too  my life seems a constant dance between taking breaks and suppressing the pain that causes me to want to escape and finding the painful feelings overflowing in spite of my best efforts to ignore them   i think it takes a lot of time and a lot of work on yourself before you can really be present i think too that you need to find someone who really gets you and is supportive to take the journey alongside you and really witness your hurt so that it can be healed   baby steps  youre doing the best you can with the resources you currently have x make sure you drink plenty of water and get enough vitamins and enough sleep do what you can to look after yourself  x seeing as this post is from yesterday and you said you were seeing the gp tomorrow im probably a bit late to give advice but just wondered how you got on at your appointment x froggy  leap back here immediately x fluoxetine is a funny one in my experience  the symptoms you are describing are not good if you still feel like this in two weeks time i would go back to the doctors and say that you dont think that the medication suits you  personally i found fluoxetine actually increased the nervous energy that i was feeling and made things around me seem really speeded up it was very overwhelming  see how it goes   also sorry to hear about the tax credit stuff i hope that the situation can get sorted remember that organisations like citizens advice are there to help if you feel just a bit too overwhelmed x obviously you have some underlying issues and i dont want to undermine that but a lot of what youre experiencing to me sounds like it is being exasperated by the stress of the esa business  how are you coping financially at the moment do you have any money to rely on  im so sorry you are waiting so long personally i think its disgusting what they are doing to people making them wait with no payment whatsoever urgh  i could rant for hours about it but ill spare you that  are you phoning the dwp to see if theres any progress being made or if youre any closer to an outcome  i presume youre waiting for the mandatory reconsideration  i dont know if it would help but if you are having these physical issues as a result of the stress id see your gp i dont know if theyve got much power to speed up the process but they might be able to offer some help   it sounds like theres not much else you can do at the moment and that you are at the mercy of the dwp  i know its a bit oversaid but any relaxation techniques would be good for you at the moment  also if youre not already then make sure you are drinking plenty of waterfluids sometimes a headache can be caused by dehydration i always have a glass of water before i consider taking any painkillers and usually the water was all i needed x i agree with buttercup in that this is a fairly normal reaction there is antianxiety medication that can be prescribed for as and when you need it its not ideal for long term use but if its just on these big occasions it may be worth speaking to your doctor the only thing i will say is that these medications can make you very sleepy and so you probably wont be at your best if you need to be speaking or meeting new people antinausea medication might help there are more herbal things you can try if thats something that interests you chamomile tea is very calming also ginger is really good for keeping nausea at bay  flower remedies can help and personally i have found rescue remedy to be very helpful i remember taking some before flying overseas when i went on holiday with a friend because i was a bit nervous about the flight and it helped me feel much calmer x so many good suggestions here this is a really useful thread  creativity is good i enjoy crossstitching and crafty stuff too as others have said  when im at a certain anxious point i do have prn meds and i also tend to focus on breathing and sipping water  but prevention is good i think gajolenes point about staying away from potentially triggering stuff in the media tv shows music news social media is a really important one  i got very very unwell several years ago when reading the daily mail website was part of my daily routine i also got really hooked on conspiracy theories not helpful in the slightest    whilst avoidance isnt always helpful when it comes to things like going out or doing some grocery shopping it is a good idea not to expose yourself to stuff that you just know is going to upset you x hi louisa welcome to the forums am glad you decided to join up and post i definitely agree that you are suffering from anxiety i wonder if this need you have to confess would fall under compulsive behaviour do you feel its something you have to do even if you dont necessarily want to its still early days for the citalopram whenever you start or come off of medication it can leave you feeling a bit rotten but hopefully it wont last too long if things turn really bad ie you get suicidal thoughts then you need to let a doctor know immediately because sometimes antidepressants can make people worse its more likely to happen if youre under25 anyway give it a couple of weeks and see how it goes who prescribed the medication for you are you seeing a mental health specialist or was it just a gp x well do you have someone you can talk to or any referrals taking place it may be worth going back to the gp and asking if there is counselling or therapy available explain that youd like to try other approaches before taking medication i think its a worthwhile idea i agree that sometimes medication just masks the problem but just make sure that you do have that alternative support in place x i think when anxiety is an issue you can very easily overthink and it can just make matters worse  also i dont know about you but i know that with some medication i just find it makes me literally feel like im wearing a mask and that im not quite connected to the world around me  facial expressions for one are very difficult i find that my face completely betrays me when im trying to portray myself a certain way its very frustrating it seems that it never really reflects how i want to be coming across  when i try to act like im ok and fine i can almost feel the awkwardness in my face and i worry that im coming across as false  oddly ive had people say that i look really well and have even been told i look glowing when ive felt like absolute shit   while its easier said than done if you can think less about how youre coming across or what people think of you then i think that the way you express yourself will be more natural  try not to let what strangers might be thinking get to you those that know you are the people that matter and as long as they understand you then thats what matters x i dont think it sounds like an excuse certain therapies arent suited to everybody i think that cbt does have its limits and personally i think youve got to be at a certain point in your recovery before you can implement it have you ever been prescribed an antidepressant i know that some of them are prescribed to help anxiety as well as depression i have found that the citalopram ive taken has helped me in terms of my anxiety as well as my mood x really sorry to hear you were assaulted andy do you know if there are any voluntary or charitable organisations in your area that offer support to people who have been assaulted it sounds like it would be good for you to talk to someone like a counsellor about your experiences x i hope the assessment has gone well  or goes well depending on when you read this honesty is the best policy i hope that you get some better support as a result of the assessment x it sounds like this job is causing you a lot of stress   nobody should be that depressed at work that they consider putting themselves in hospital a better option than being at their job  what kind of financial responsibilities do you have are you living alone do you need to pay billsrent etc  you say your dad isnt very helpful i presume you live at home  the reason i ask is that if you are that unhappy then its probably best that you find work elsewhere it sounds like the workplace is quite dysfunctional and whilst you can try your best to succeed there it seems that there are dynamics with managers and colleagues that arent going to change   im sorry if me telling you to quit your job isnt the answer you want to hear perhaps someone with a bit more experience of being in employment can help  i just think your health and wellbeing is a priority it would be awful if you were to hurt yourself seriously simply because the stress of work got too much for you to take x im glad to hear that you will be seeing a therapist again soon  to answer your question yes  it is possible that people can go through their whole lives without any recollection of abuse and then suddenly memories come flooding back  whilst i agree that the past cant be changed and therefore it doesnt always seem logical to spend time focusing on things that have happened i do think that these things need to be talked through with somebody   i think the demons of the past need to be faced otherwise all of these feelings that you describe as having the disgust anger dirty unprotected will always be there under the surface  when it comes to this sort of thing it is best that the subjects are approached slowly and in your own time in therapy otherwise things can get very easily out of hand and can leave you feeling overwhelmed  hopefully your therapist will be a good one and will be sensitive to your needs x i dont think bats bite or at least not the ones where i live they generally have to be held down andor provoked into attacking i understand that you probably understand that it is highly unlikely a bat has bitten you but that doesnt always help to calm the anxiety does it if i were you id keep a close eye on yourself if you feel youre having any serious issues then phone for a doctor it is probably just a mosquito or midges if you visit your local pharmacistchemist and ask them what they have for insect bites im sure theyll have some soothing cream and whilst youre there they could take a look and give you their opinion it might put your mind at rest x im quite complex on this issue yes i do have health anxiety at times but i havent made any lifestyle changes and have no intention of doing so lol i think on one level im quite an optimist when it comes to my health like nothing bad is ever really going to happen to me  on the other hand when im in the midst of anxiety i do sometimes worry that a headache im getting is something more sinister x i can understand your dilemma sometimes being more aware can actually be unhelpful  there is a reason for derealisation and its usually because your brain cant cope with the stress and anxiety you feel  have you been offered any therapy alongside the medication  i think that medication can help but only to a point it sounds like your thought process is clearly contributing to how you are feeling and so it would be good for you to explore your thoughts with a therapist or counsellor x intrusive thoughts are very difficult to deal with there are medications that can reduce your anxiety overall but as far as actually getting rid of the thoughts then no  there isnt any medication for it i think that counselling or therapy can help you cope with the troubling thoughts that youre having  you dont say the content of the thoughts or how they make you feel but sometimes people can get the idea that they are somehow bad for their intrusive thoughts i think with therapy or counselling you can learn to accept that the brain is a very complicated thing and ultimately we dont have control over what comes into our head however we can decide how we react to it  as hard as it is ultimately the more you think that you shouldnt be thinking something the more intense the thought becomes when it comes to intrusive thoughts ideally there needs to be some acceptance of the thought and then you can move on  also sometimes i have found distraction techniques can help doing the times tables trying to use my imagination to visualise something else eg a beach and try to imagine all of my senses experiencing the beach try to hear the waves feel the sand beneath my feet smell the ocean etc x yeah its totally your choice whether or not you decide to change your name   my full name is kind of two names in one over the years ive had just the first part then just the second part and now im back to just the first part again   i do think that names have certain energies and it can feel quite empowering to change your name if youre currently stuck with one that you dont like x ah yes sorry i missed that bit   still i would go to a gp and explain the situation to them they cant just let you go cold turkey surely or if they do they might be able to tell you what to expect and what to look out for in case you need urgent care x sorry youre still feeling rubbish gecko  im glad your boss was understanding towards you with regards to the mental health side of things  sounds like youve got a busy week ahead of you not helped by the fact youre not sleeping very well have you tried anything to help you get some sleep  also does your cpn know youre feeling really down at the moment   hopefully when the show youre doing finishes at the weekend you can catch up on some rest on sunday it might be that being so busy is wearing you down too x but youve made it you bloody well deserve flowers and cards  i mean it i really think youve done so well to stick at it in spite of feeling the way you do some time off the planet would be good sometimes wouldnt it   is it half term soon will you be getting some time off xx welcome to the forum its understandable that youre worried about affecting your family but at the end of the day you dont chose to feel unwell and so it cannot be helped has anyone in the family made any comments that would lead you to believe that they are getting intolerant im sure that they love and care about you and just want you to be better x welcome to the forum  sometimes i think friends dont really know what to say or how to act for the best im sure if they knew just how deeply affected you have been and still are by the anxiety then theyd want to help you out i suppose its just not something that people really know how to deal with because its not something that really gets talked about what kind of support would you like from them sometimes i think its just better to ask outright than wait for an offer i know its extremely difficult to reach out i never do because im too worried about it but people arent mindreaders and so if there is something you need ie maybe someone who you can call when things are getting too much then say  it sounds like there have been stressful changes in your life and so there does seem to be an explanation for your anxiety to be triggered again have you made any appointments to see your gp or anything it might be helpful to chat to them and explain how you are feeling ideally you can nip this in the bud or at least get some control over it before it goes back to how bad it was before x im probably going to make myself sound like a right cow but i dread school holidays because there are so many children about  just going into the supermarket earlier made me really want to scream obscenities   you had kids running around and skidding on the floor im a physically wobbly person and get very depersonalised in supermarkets and so my reflexes arent very quick  its lucky that the kids didnt bump into me i would have probably swore at them and their parents  also some stupid little prat said big bum big bum about me and his  mother told him to be quiet he was like no i said bin bag fucking little idiot  i blame the parents though as much as anything   basically im not a fan of children either to be honest they are noisy selfish insensitive little bastards  but you have to have compassion and realise its not really their fault if their parents havent disciplined them or taught them manners you cant really blame them for the way they are    does you tv have a headphone socket i use headphones a lot because they really help block out noises x freemymind has pretty much covered what i was going to say to you i think that bullying can have a really profound effect on people even years after its stopped i got bullied badly and a lot of what you describes sounds similar to what ive experienced though i have to say i dont like crowds but i can understand why they make you feel like you can hide better when there are fewer people around it an be quite exposing i do think the psychological nurse was very unhelpful as it sounds like you are suffering with anxietypanic attacks did you explain every symptom to her it surprises me that she can be so dismissive do you still go to schoolcollege do they have any student counselling services you can access it may be that you need to seek help elsewhere  i do just want to tell you that things do tend to get better the more you put yourself out there in the adult world school and schoolchildren can be notoriously cruel whilst you still get some arseholes no matter where you go in life generally people do grow up and stop being so mean to one another when you described how you feel when people make a negative or critical comment i could so remember how utterly devastated i used to be when i was in that situation even something quite trivial being said would be totally heartbreaking i think because of the bullying i had very low selfesteem and whatever was being said confirmed my thoughts that i wasnt good enough i have got more confidence now though and hopefully have a stronger sense of self sometimes when somebody says something critical it can say far more about them than you sometimes people have their own hangups and if youre quite a vulnerable person you can be the target for their projections what im saying is as you interact more with people and develop your filter gets better i have learned when to take on board what somebodys saying and when actually the problem lies with them and their nitpicking is nothing to do with me  it gets easier is what im trying to say x i understand your frustration  people dont just have mental health problems 95 mondayfriday   in fact i reckon most people have bad times at night and on the weekend    you know you can always phone nhs 111 if things are really bad   what i will say is the more fuss you make the more likely you are to be helped  so if youre feeling really bad dont give up asking for help because you dont want to make a fuss   i was having a really bad time last summer and in the end i was given then number of a local psychiatric ward they told me there would always be someone i could talk to on the end of a phone if i needed it no matter what time of night x hope youre feeling a bit better and im pleased people have helped you here x when im in a particularly bad way yes i can feel anxious pretty much all of the time also i spent most of my time feeling depersonalised i feel as though there is a veil between me and the real world it can be quite scary cant it  x probably not a good idea to go cold turkey especially if youve been taking them for months go back to whoever prescribed them for you and explain your situation they might be able to prescribe more with a sensible plan of reducing the dose or at the very least theyll be able to give you some advice on selfcare when coming off of the valium  you need some proper medical advice on this one because its likely that youll feel really awful just stopping them cold turkey x there are some good suggestions here chamomile tea helps me i also dont think you can go wrong with lavender either  but as you say its best to ask the docs before taking herbal remedies some herbs can be dangerous if youre pregnant too not that thats a worry for me  x i think indirectly my anxiety does lead to eating problems when i get anxious i feel quite faint and out of it i think i use unhealthy foods as a way of grounding myself  i think anxiety can sometimes feel similar to low blood sugar too like when you havent eaten anything and are really hungry the shaky wobbly feeling can easily be confused x glad that somethings worked for you ive found diazepam to be not as helpful as lorazepam but nonetheless  im pleased to hear you got some relief from it  x i think its understandable that people can feel worse during the summer everywhere just seems much busier there are  more people around and theres generally much more activity  at least midsummer has passed now were closer to autumn sorry not much help is it just wanted to say that i can understand why you feel this way and im sorry that its a difficult time of year for you x i live alone and spend a lot of time by myself so i cant really relate first hand to what youre going through  do you know what particularly it is you are afraid of is it something more practical eg someone breaking in that could be helped by making some changes more locksalarm system etc   sorry to hear that this is such an intense struggle for you x i experience chest pain too  a few months ago it was particularly bad and it would knock the wind out of me  thinking about it i do have a bad posture and should probably do something about it ive heard wonderful things about the alexander technique   im glad to hear that the test from the doctors have come back as normal   whilst it doesnt take the pain away it must be reassuring for you to know that there isnt any serious underlying problem for you to worry about x i would definitely encourage you to see a gp you are having whats caused intrusive thoughts please dont judge yourself for this  you are not a bad person and you are in control of your actions its just that you are having anxiety and your brain is deciding to be a bastard not a medical term  there is help out there x the vitamin d thing never occurred to me so thanks for that info kate    it sounds bad but i am very intolerant of light i find that if im outside and its really sunny it can be quite painful on my eyes thats very vampirey isnt it   i do very much relate to what youre saying its gone half three and im feeling fine  i despise being awake during the daytime hate having to get up early for anything  it does worry me in terms of how im ever going to lead a productive life suppose just look to work night shifts    im sure its a depression thing i find the stillness of the night really comforting   for me it also makes my sense that theres nothing to live for and my loneliness much less apparent at night nobodys around theres nothing going on  so i literally dont know what im missing   sorry to make my reply about myself you are definitely not alone in how you feel x thanks pentagram its good to have a name for this because its something i experience too x sorry to hear that this phobia seems to be out of control and ruining your life there are things that might be worth a try do speak to your gp if you havent done already cbt as toasted crumpet said can be helpful there are loads of other things out there too but they arent usually available on the nhs things like hypnosis nlp or eft it does mean paying money but if youre at that point where enough is enough it could help  i am wondering if you live near a zoo at all i know that sounds odd but i know that bristol zoo offer phobia days its just a group session where they have a therapist helping you to overcome your fears and then at the end of the day the aim is to hold whatever it is youre scared of they definitely do them for spiders and snakes a bit of a long shot but there might be something out there x sometimes i imagine scenarios and they can seem so real that i am not sure if its an authentic memory or just something ive made up generally i have gut feelings as to whether or not what im thinking about actually happened and usually it hasnt  obviously when recalling a time youve had a few too many drinks is going to be difficult i think unless there is evidence facebook photos peoples comments that would show that you did do something bad its safe to assume that you probably just went home it may just be that you dont remember anything because you didnt really do anything particularly memorable x hi welcome to the forum i havent had any experience of zoloft but i have taken other ssris  they can take a while to work up to a few weeks but i have found them to be quite helpful i still have anxiety issues but i do find myself more relaxed than when i dont take them x welcome to the forum  i havent personally had any experience of the medication youve mentioned but have tried other snri drugs i wonder if theres a reason you havent been prescribed an ssri that might sound like gobbledygook to you theyre just different types of antidepressants they both ultimately try to produce the same results as one another but they work in different ways im not much of a scientist so probably havent explained it well  sorry  off on a tangent you can find bad reviews online for pretty much every type of medication each medicine will naturally work differently on each individual so whats bad for one person might be really good for somebody else  even on this board there are people who have a variety of experiences on different meds ive seen really positive reviews for meds that didnt help me at all and have seen people have a really bad time on meds that have really saved me  how long have you been taking them it takes a while for them to kick in sometimes  also sometimes people dont always take to the first thing theyre prescribed its trial and error really  i think it is possible to cope without medication but i think you need lots of tools in order to do that sometimes having some time on meds can help you just while you find other ways of coping  whether you decide to try to make a go of it without the drugs or not i really hope you start to feel better soon x urgh some meds can be so sedating   i have some friends who are very antipharmaceuticals and into their herbal healing they mean well of course but if sometimes eating your lettuce just doesnt cut the mustard and if you find a medicine that helps then really its not for other people to tell you not to rely on them x welcome to the forums  i have social anxiety too sometimes its worse than others but i can sympathise with your situation im sorry youre feeling so isolated and uncomfortable whenever you arent at home  have you sought any help for your feelings x hey welcome to the forums    have you tried talking to a different gp whilst in theory they should all be aware of mental illness some are more on the ball than others   ive seen a gp in the pasts during a crisis who said completely the wrong thing to me and was totally unhelpful ive also seen gps who are very compassionate and understanding and who have genuinely wanted to help   it may be an idea to see another gp and just explain how bad youre feeling i notice you said that your mum and sister are the only reason you dont do something stupid  its against the rules of the forum to go into selfharm specifics but if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself even if you dont think youll act on them you must tell the gp thats presuming you havent already   the only other suggestion i have is to look and see if you have a local mind centre or if rethink run any services in your area you can go onto their websites and i think you can type in your postcode and theyll show you whats available in your area x as others have said it definitely sounds like some form of anxietypanic attack   poor you theyre really horrid especially when they come on out of the blue   its good that you went to the hospital and got told you are all healthy its really good to have that knowledge because sometimes it can really feel like somethings wrong when it is just in fact anxiety symptoms ive been convinced i was going to have a heart attack before not good   hopefully when you see the doctors theyll be able to offer you some support some medications are helpful but so are some selfsoothing techniques its good that you called your mum do you have anybody else you might be able to phone   sometimes it helps just to have that contact to help keep you grounded x maybe try to do some practical things to help make sure windows are closed if you get too hot you can get a fan blackout blinds may help to block out some disturbances  i live in a flat where i have people living both above me below me and to the side  i cannot recommend earplugs enough screaming toddlers and drunk people creating a racket arent a problem for me when i need to go to sleep  if the issue is more during the day then try having the radio on or something it might feel better to hear some noise thats your own  im sorry that this is putting you on edge hopefully in time youll adjust and be happy in your new home x uh yeah i was going to reply to this thread earlier but yknow   seriously though i am a procrastinator its just as well i dont have things of great importance to do  although ive noticed in the last year or so that ive started to arrive late to appointments and stuff its not good i used to always be there early x welcome to the forum  its not a pathetic first post at all so please dont worry  x happy birthday for tomorrow i hope the people youre celebrating with make a fuss of you   it sounds like youre a really kind person and people are obviously taking that for granted oh and i doubt youre a boring person   the thing is ive found people are just really bad at keeping in touch i know im guilty of this myself  sometimes people are busy they forget to get back to you they dont want to put themselves out there to ask to meet up because theyre scared youll say no etc  although it might feel like nobody cares and people ignore you i doubt its something being done deliberately maybe if they realised just how you felt they might make more of an effort to talk to you and make sure you felt included x as others have said talking to your doctor is a good step to take  i have too many kinds of issues to list and while i havent been cured ive definitely been helped to cope better and manage things on my own  i hope they help you too x it sounds like a tricky situation and its not nice feeling that you have to hide away  there is a risk that the situation isnt as bad as you think but by avoiding it and being fearful you could make it more awkward i dont want to make you feel bad at all because this is something thats obviously really difficult for you to deal with  have you tested the waters with the fathers girlfriend have you talked to her at all since the incident at the park  having grown up in an abusive household has probably made you more fearful than you need to be  perhaps just start by going inside and cooking a meal take little steps and youll feel braver x i did think that maybe the thought you had were along the lines of intrusive thoughts  it sounds like you might be having some kind of hallucination though whether or not its due to psychosis is another thing theres something called the hypnagogic state  basically where youre between waking and sleep  and its really common to have different kinds of hallucinations when youre in that state of being personally i think that the dark makes it worse i have some kind of night light on when i get off to sleep purely because i get that kind of thing a lot when its dark and it sometimes leaves me feeling scaredunable to relax  i think its worth sharing your concerns with a doctor though especially if its not getting much better x sometimes pain under the lower left ribcage can indicate problems with being quite constipated  you dont have to give details if you dont want to but if its something youre having a problem with you should try and sort it out  i havehad lots of issues in this area recently ive been struggling with nausea previously i was having problems with acid reflux im on tablets for it now but the tablets seem to have had a laxative effect which in turn makes me feel lethargic etc etc i think anxiety and stress can have such a major impact on the stomach and digestive system x you can get moth repellent products cant you there are certain scents they dont like i know some of the moth repellent products can smell a bit odd but there are some better ones out there that smell more pleasant than others ive seen strips of what i presume is sticky paper or it must have something on it that they dont like that you can stick to windows and stuff to keep them away  obviously it would be better to deal with the root cause but have you tried any of these preventative things  x do women have an adams apple anyway i do get a funny feeling on my throat sometimes its like i can feel my pulse in the front of my neck and its as if theres a huge lump there its usually when im upset or it can be when i exercise too much  i think it might be related to breathing  i think you should chat to a nurse or doctor about it though you probably would have noticed if something is wrong with your thyroid but as thats where the thyroid is its worth them checking to see that youre healthy in that respect x im not speaking as staff here so dont take this as official im just speaking as a fellow forum user i can understand how you or anybody else might feel quite upset and triggered by what other people may post people use this site as a place to come to talk about things that are disturbing them and thats not always good to read  particularly if youre feeling vulnerable  personally id much rather someone came onto a site like this and talk about having urges to do harmful things than to actually go out and do them in real life you must remember too that if people are posting these types of things on a mental health forum it means that they know that theyre not well and they want some help the way i see it if someone was inclined and really set on hurting someone i doubt theyd pause to post online about it  people can be mentally ill in lots of different ways i cant quite understand how other people would want to hurt someone else but having said that im sure there are others who cant understand why i would hurt myself  sometimes its good to stay away from subforums which you know you might find troubling i know when im feeling a bit overwhelmed i just stick to the chillout section  i just want to say though that in terms of the site being dangerous we do have forum staff to make sure that that isnt the case hopefully nothing gets said thats too harmful or out of control and if it does it gets moderated or edited x x yep  they do indeed apply to me   headaches  before resorting to a painkiller i drink a big glass of cold water and then wait a short while i think a lot of my headaches are due to dehydration and the water helps make them go away 9 times out of 10  aches pains and tense muscles  if its really bad then i will take a painkiller also pain relief gel is good if theres a particular area thats sore i like to use a hot water bottle tucked into my jeansskirt because my lower back is always an area that hurts but the heat really does relieve it  chest pain and rapid heartbeat  try not to freak out about it ive noticed the worse thing i can do when im experiencing chestheart issues is to panic it just makes it much worse what helps me is just calmly accepting that its just anxiety and that ill be ok  nervousness and shaking ringing in the ear  ringing in the ear i was absolutely amazed when i did some selfreflexology when i was having really intense ringing in my ears the points for ears are basically where your toes meet the sole of your feet  the length of that ridge theres also a point thats your second and third toe with big toe being first basically i just rubbed about in that area and within seconds it went its worth a go    of course i do have issues with all the other points on the list but havent really got any tips or advice on dealing with those x lets hope the report recommendations get implemented   i must admit i am somewhat surprised to read of the amount of people who suffer with anxiety and the poor coping mechanisms used   i know this isnt really a particularly nice thing to say but i do find it reassuring to know im not alone and that these problems are more common than people think x i agree with dillf  it might be helpful to see a doctor different areas offer different services so am not quite sure what help is there in your area however your gp should be able to help you you might get referred to another service that offers therapy or groups for anxiety  i think 7 months is still quite a short time in your new house its completely natural to take some time getting used to things knowing which noises are out of the ordinary and which arent  x  oh and welcome to the forum oh sorry the doctors made you feel less than understood and cared for did you meet with the mental health doctor in the end  it could be an anxiety attack provoked by the unfamiliar noises i get that a lot too but i dont think living alone helps me  its difficult when youre so easily startled isnt it the only thing that helps me when my heart is racing is to concentrate on my breathing counting my inhale and exhale x i can relate to what youve posted and would say that it almost certainly is your anxiety worsening if i were you id make an appointment with your doctor i got myself in to a bit of a state a while back and was convinced that something was drastically wrong with me i saw a gp and she was very understanding i told her straight away that i thought it probably was anxiety but i just needed some reassurance she gave me lots of different checks and confirmed that i was physically healthy  have you sought any help before for your anxiety i think you could kill two birds with one stone in seeing your gp  you can get the checks you need to be assured that youre physically ok and also talk about your anxiety and hopefully get some help for it x im sorry to hear youre struggling too it sounds like youre really trying to help yourself by keeping occupied its horrible when you want to feel better but just cant do you find things like having a bath helpful or maybe listening to soothing music sometimes when im in a bit of a state i go on youtube and there a lots of videosmusic tracks for meditation sometimes even nature noises help like the ocean or a woodland  might be an idea x i agree with kermone its likely that ptsd is making you think in this way from what youve said it sounds like she didnt show up on time anyway and so what can she expect these kind of local sites are full of time wasters ive experienced a few situations where people havent turned up when they said they would and wasted my time  anyway try to put this worry out of your mind because im sure shes probably not even thinking about the tumble dryer let alone coming to your house unannounced xx very useful  in fact i think understanding and identifying thinking distortions has been really crucial for me in managing my anxietydepression or should i say attempting to manage my anxietydepression x its a tricky situation when youre waiting to feel more robust isnt it  im in that boat for sure and the more time goes by the more convinced i am that im not going to wake up one day and feel stronger its getting out there that is going to help me feel stronger though having said that i think in your case youll be wise to hang on for a while   i dont want to worry you but i feel like youve been left it a potentially unsafe state obviously the dissociation is your brains way of protecting you but im concerned at just how vulnerable your situation sounds  will you contact the mental health servicesyour cpn tomorrow tuesday i think they need to be made aware of whats going on for you   being in a dissociated state is really horrid i know first hand how difficult it makes life   really hope you feel better soon and that you can get more support in place x gecko if you are at risk then you must phone 111 or indeed calling the samaritans is a good idea  it might help to have a real life conversation   i dont know if your hubby is supportive or not but im sure hed rather know you are safe and be woke up than find you feeling in a really bad way    am so sorry that all this stuff has been brought up and youve been left to deal with it by yourself x good idea i think thats a good decision  x im 24 and im exactly the same whether its general friendships or something more with men i always tend to gravitate to those who are much older than i am  for me i feel safer with older people i did have a lot of bullying in secondary school and its so part of me feels like people my own age arent to be trusted this is especially true of boys  then again ive always been a bit of an old soul and even though i was a very popular girl in primary school i always felt a bit different and knew that people around me werent quite on my wavelength  i wouldnt worry about it too much its nice to have acquaintances of all ages but in terms of real friendships its better to spent your time with people who you find interesting  i dont know if its social anxiety it could be how do you feel when you mix with people  of course it could just be that youre an introvert even when i spend time with people im really comfortable with i breathe a sigh of relief when i have time alone again to recharge my batteries x that must be a really unnerving thought im sure your friend was saying it from a sincere place rather than wanting to put you in a position of vulnerability perhaps it might be an idea to spend some time outside you dont have to go to where your friend recommended if you dont feel safe enough  obviously if its going to cause you a huge amount of anxiety then take it easy  but i think one way you could get rid of this thought is to go out and see that actually its safe sometimes it can be good to face the fear and see that actually the anxiety is worse than the reality x i cant wrap my brain around the idea of pensions and am not entirely sure what the government is getting at with it all  i suppose im choosing to be in denial i also find it really hard to imagine being an old lady   im sorry youve got so many health issues to deal with it must be really difficult and complicate treatment x i know you might be scared of talking to a doctor but you really must they are not there to judge you they are there to help and i guarantee that nothing you say will shock them it sounds like what youre experiencing is really frightening but if you can be brave and tell your doctor about it then they can help x obviously massage is a really good thing if youre on a budget and cant afford loads it might be an idea to see if your local colleges has a salon open to the public when i did my massage training we had one evening open to public who would pay something like 8 for a full body massage obviously nobody is a professional but we werent let loose on the public until we knew what we were doing  might be an idea have you got a bath where you live having a nice bath is good too also although they are an acquired taste herbal teas are good ive also got a microwavable lavender pillow basically you heat it up and it helps relieve muscle tension  those are just a few things that help me anyway  as i say probably an idea to go to the docs to rule out anything physical there could be a number of things causing the tension though mind you  anxiety and depression for that matter can really take its toll on the body x im not sure if it will you may not need hospital treatment not sure where youre from but they like to keep people out of hospital whenever possible do you live alone or with family im just wondering what kind of support you have around you its likely that theyll put you on some meds that should in theory help with how youre feeling  anyway you have nothing to lose by asking for help it might seem scary but im sure what youre experiencing at the moment is probably much more frightening and upsetting x ah me too isnt it annoying and the more aware you are that youre blushing the more you blush have you ever blushed so much that your eyes started watering and tears ran down your cheeks i have its bloody annoying  i especially get that thing where i have an embarrassed reaction to something im not embarrassed about whats that all about  one thing that has helped though i dont do use it so much any more is to put on a green primer  it doesnt necessarily make a huge difference it just helps to balance out redness in your complexion im sure its a bit of a placebo effect but still just by convincing myself that this green stuff on my face made my blushing less visible was enough to help interrupt that horrible cycle of making blushing worse because you know youre blushing   its a painful situation isnt it and i still get it every now and then but once youre more relaxed about it all the more it improves x also hydration if youre sleeping that much then theres a change that not only are you not getting enough vitamins but you could be dehydrated which doesnt help i would also suggest seeing your doctor too they should take some blood to rule out things like anaemia or hypothyroidism x ah im sorry to hear you and your partner had a rough patch though personally if you sorted things out after a day then it sounds like you both do really want to be with one another  its really difficult to say whether the anxiety will sort itself out on its own or whether it will stick around two weeks isnt really long enough to know either way  if i were you i would still chat to the doctor and consider the prozac if things continue to be difficult for you though thats just my view  i think its better to catch these things sooner rather than later because time can just make anxiety a lot worse x welcome to the forums   the feelings you describe of things being unreal and dreamlike sounds to me like derealisationdepersonalisation its something i experience a lot too and at times it can feel like its a sight problem and that your eyes are playing tricks on you it might help you to read up on it on wikipedia or wherever unfortunately there is no cure as such but it can be helpful to put a name to an experience and know that there are other people out there who get the same thing  i dont know if its very understood or what the reasons for derealisation are but there is one idea that its the brains way of switching off and protecting itself when things are too much considering that you are feeling that the world is scaryfragile and are being bombarded with unpleasant thoughts and imagery i do think that it would make sense that youre brain is saying thats enough im switching off  by that token its not until you really sort out the anxiety that the feelings of derealisation will get any better do you notice that these feelings are worse the more worked up you are  i think the anxiety is getting quite out of control and difficult for you to handle and is manifesting itself in the thought avalanche i cant diagnose you obviously but it sounds like an anxietypanic attack  oh and one more word of advice never google your physical symptoms i can guarantee it will make you drive yourself around the bend and make you convinced you have a very serious illness do not underestimate the physical effects of anxiety stress and depression x this isnt something ive really experienced for a long time but am finding myself struggling with now  im worrying that something bad or disastrous is going to happen the more i try to ignore it the more im convinced im having some kind of premonition   wheres the logical reasoning part of the brain when you need it   to be more specific my parents are going away for the weekend  i live on my own and they visit 2 times a week on average so i cant say i depend on them a great deal but i always have a big wobble whenever they go away anywhere  i cant specifically understand what it is that bothers me so much or why i feel so unsafe when i know theyre not a 40 minute drive away  i just a horrible worrying feeling that they wont come back and ill never see them again if you see what i mean   i got myself into a bit of a state earlier to the point where i was thinking of phoning them to tell them i love them even though they literally left my flat only a couple of hours ago after visiting me today obviously ive resisted because doing that would have only freaked them out or made them feel guilty for going or both   its so so irrational yet so so real and frightening   someone knock some sense into me theyll be fine right itll all be fine im not having some eerie psychic insight im just wobbling right very true  thanks for the reminder i have felt like this before and its all just been in my own head  and big thanks to you too lu  sometimes its just good to hear it from an outside source xx you lot are lovely just want to say thanks for the support even though ive huggedthankedliked already  x i was wondering the same as misskitty can you identify a possible trigger for this increased restlessness  a couple of things that have helped me going for a walk to get rid of that excess energy having a bath deep breathing listening to chilled out music or my nature noises album writing it down doing something creative to channel that energy into something soothing teas chamomile is great if you can stand the taste etc   if it doesnt pass it might be worth talking to whoever is responsible for your care your cpn or psychiatrist x tea and coffee do count though there are different opinions on it also people say 2 litres is the right amount but there are loads of factors that affect how much you should have this is a link to a hydration calculator i cant say that its professional or endorsed etc etc but its useful i suppose to give you some idea hydration calculator  i think the reason i was suggesting hydration is because ive been and still am at times in a similar position with excess sleep and tiredness i know that i always wake up feeling hydrated plus i was never awake long enough to get the right intake of fluid you are absolutely right in that you shouldnt start drinking lots and lots and its not good to drink huge amounts in one sitting i usually have a 15 litre bottle next to me and take sips out of it steadily during the day  ive started taking multivitamins for the last week or so i suppose its still too early to say but ive not noticed much improvement yet  i cant remember if youve already said youve been to the docs for blood tests but if you havent already then i think its worth going just to rule out any physical reasons why youre so tired x i sent mum a few texts last night and theyll be back tomorrow  its funny the bad feeling seems to have gone randomly the same as it came   i get like this a lot with people i care about feeling like theyre going to die  have no idea why this is such an issue ive never actually lost anybody that close to me really and my parents are still together and happily married  mind you ive felt totally emotionally abandoned repeatedly and its been very painful maybe thats what its about who knows xx welcome to the forum  whos prescribing your meds a gp or a psychiatrist have you explained to them that you cant cope with your moods i get the feeling that nobody is listening and its not exactly the nicest feeling in the world but im wondering whats been said or not said to you thats made you feel like that x perhaps you need to speak to your psychiatrist again particularly if youve had no help since the episode where you nearly got sectioned  is there someone that can attend an appointment for you it might even be worth seeing if you have a mental health advocacy service in your area so that an advocate can go with you in my experience mental health professionals are quite quick to fob you off if youve saying something by yourself but if you involve a third party whos there to back you up they have to sit up and take notice x i can only suggest what dd1ps has already said really  it is definitely worth seeing a different doctor and explaining you felt misunderstood the last time you spoke to a professional  explain the things that you do that you think are abnormal and also mention the alcohol use is a direct result of the social anxiety that you feel  i really hope you get listened to and given some help x it could be that you dont have the tic or it could be that your parents and counsellor dont see it or dont want to mention it to you  either way if you have it or not being aware of it is only going to make it worse i cant say that ive ever experienced anything like this myself but having social anxiety i know how the mind can torture itself  it sounds as though if the underlying issues with social anxiety were helped then the tic might sort itself out have you spoke to your doctor at all about your issues i know this isnt necessarily the answer to everything but being on citalopram and other antidepressants has really helped me out in terms of my social anxiety its not that im suddenly the life and soul of the party but the inhibitions that weigh me down just seem to have been lifted x as someone that left the family home not through choice and has been forced to be independent id say you really need to make sure you move out when youre ready to  as much as i used to get short tempered and frustrated sometimes i do miss having company and loneliness is a big issue not only that but it really doesnt help my mental heath in terms of my grip on reality when theres hardly anybody else around to talk to  im very daydreamy and depersonalised most of the time   is it possible for you to get out go places on your own im not sure what your physical problems are so that might be an issue but if you can get out it would be helpful  even on really bad days when i lived in the family home i always took the dogs out for a walk every afternoon and that really helped x i really think its worth a go independent living especially as you do have a supportive family to go back to if things didnt work out as well as youd hoped  pets are great company so its good to hear that youve got a little kitty to take with you    not sure who you have supporting you but i would chat with whoever handles your care and say its something youre considering you might be able to get some sort of supported or sheltered accommodation find out whats out there x i just tend to focus on the things i do like about my appearance and make the most of the good points this is something my mum kind of passed on to me she told me there was a point where the only thing she could think of that she liked about herself was her ankles because they were thin so she wore ankle bracelets  i think thats quite a good principle to take on there must be something even if its just one little thing that you like or at least accept about yourself  to be honest i used to be a bit like this then my attitude changed i gave up caring i realised that theres always someone willing to criticise no matter what you look like  so what difference does it make x wear a halter neck or something like that i think its about hiding the things you dont like and flaunting what you do like  for me i always get told that i have such a beautiful face and that im really pretty for a girl of my size  i know ive got nice hair nice teeth and occasionally i get compliments on my eyes so i wear clothes that are more flatteringcovering for my body and just make the most of whats there from the neck up lol x its good that you go to the dropin place  does mind or rethink run any services in your area or are they the ones you already go to  its so difficult when you dont have real life friends i do have friends but theyre all 1520 odd years older than me with their own children to look after cant exactly expect them to drop everything to come around for a cuppa  also even when you do eventually go out to actually get a lasting friendship and have the confidence to invite them over is difficult too   did you just not see a course that appealed to you or were there other issues transportcostetc  ive found that doing courses has helped me ive been doing pottery its come to an end now and i dont have any lasting friendships out of it but it really helped me just to be around people in a nonthreatening environment   i think thats a key thing for me being in a nonthreatening environment ive found my older friends through going to different spiritual groups like meditation classes and the like i dont know if thats something youre into or that goes on in your area  dont know what your beliefs are but maybe even church might give you some sense of community x i was going to ask you if something significant had happened around the time that you noticed this change you may not be able to make the link on a conscious level but i wouldnt be surprised if perhaps losing your father has had a lasting impact on your mental health perhaps therapy might help you explore your feelings a bit more and enable you to pinpoint whats causing this nervousness obviously what helps one person might not be so helpful to another but i do want to add that my social anxiety seems to improve without conscious effort whenever im taking citalopram antidepressant not that im saying you should do that but just saying whats helped me anyway if this is really impacting your life then id suggest getting in touch with a doctor or somebody who can point you in the right direction of getting some help x i think im the other way around if anything i get more alert and agitated at night x i know its a bit of a cliche but journalling and writing things down may be helpful   it doesnt matter if its not articulate or if your thoughts dont come out in a particular order just write whatevers in your head and then you can make sense of it later  with the comfort eating im not entirely sure what to suggest because i do it too   as you said its a relatively new thing youre struggling with i wonder if there was something else you were doing before that helped you that youre not doing now especially since you have a son to look after  for instance did you spent more time exercising did you pamper yourself did you do something creative  obviously youve got less time to yourself now so that must be having an impact   im just wondering if you can identify whats different from before that might have altered your way of coping x you could write what you eat but when i wrote that i meant generally keeping a diary of your thoughtsfeelings  you mustnt beat yourself up thinking youre letting your son down  of course you need to look after yourself so that youre in a better position to look after him but im sure youre doing an amazing job of raising him   i dont have any children but i would imagine that you might be fearful of being judged by reaching out and saying youre struggling a bit but is anybody around to help you take care of him you havent mentioned if his dads in the picture or not  im just wondering if you could have even an afternoon a week where someone looks after him for a bit someone you trust someone in your family or whatever so that you can have some time to recharge your batteries i think its important for parents to have that time for themselves i really do x its such a difficult decision to make medications are so potent even antidepressants that gps dish out like smarties  i can relate to just wanting to feel normal   personally im always on a merrygoround without the merry of initially feeling great on medication then feeling worse so then i stop them all and at first i feel great but unsurprisingly i come crashing down  both the improvement i get initially on meds and off meds never seems to last   obviously i dont know what youre taking but if youre on more than one medicine perhaps you could lower just one   do talk to your doctor about how youre feeling and see what they suggest take care x unfortunately i dont really think there is a way to change the feeling first i think that some days moods can be better than others and so its going to be easier to go out on a good day i can really relate to this scenario and lets just put it this way  ive waited months at a time to feel better before going out into the world  i think its about little steps too being realistic about what you feel able to do and not giving yourself a huge challenge sometimes its an achievement if ive forced myself to go to the library other times i feel inspired and go out for a walk just to be outside  sorry that thats not really much help its just my take on things and also just want you to know youre not on your own with what youre experiencing x youre not dying seriously   i sometimes think im dying god knows ive tried to die but alas i live to see another day x yeah did you say in my astro thread that you were a fellow scorpio were ruled by pluto see death and rebirth transformation phoenix out of the ashes and all that jazz  x yeah were not afraid of strangers in dark alleyways  we are the strangers in dark alleyways x some antidepressants are prescribed for anxiety too so thats possibly why you handled things differently when you were on them i take citalopram which is an antidepressant but is also used for anxiety i do find that my social anxiety calms down somewhat when im on it im not fearful of speaking and can actually have a conversation now  it might be helpful to look up thinking distortions which includes catastrophising sometimes just identifying how your thoughts are skewed can be a helpful thing to do because it makes you aware that what youre thinking is not necessarily accurate or true x im no expert but id imagine that this probably is due to the alcohol did you notice these sleeping problems start when you gave up drinking or have they started since you started drinking again im not much of a drinker at all in fact over a year i think ill drink a maximum of 5 times on special occasions and when i do drink i have a hell of a time with my sleeping i wake up after only an hour or two and then find it hard to get back to bed if youre drinking more regularly then it wouldnt surprise me if this is what was causing your sleep pattern to go a bit funny at all  when you quit drinking were you supervised or did you get any advice from a doctor on how to quit or was it just a cold turkey thing it might be worth mentioning your situation to a doctor to see if they can recommend anything even if they cant help in terms of prescribing they might be able to give you some idea of how long you can expect this to go on for and what you can do to help yourself x someone will be taking over the contract but as youve not actually had the letter or forms to fill in for a reassessment id say youre safe until the new people come along which is supposedly in early 2015  i cant say this for sure but im sure ive read that theyre only going to be dealing with new claims and reassessments that are already in their system and not taking on anything new i sent off my form for a reassessment back in late november so i presume eventually theyll be getting in touch with me at some point but for somebody in your position id imagine youll be left alone until the new company come along whoever they are x i hope your doctor is helpful  have you been offered any help with dealing with the anxiety any booklets selfhelp advice cbt anything   you say camhs so im not too sure how old you are but when i was with camhs i was prescribed lorazepam which i still take now when im in a really bad way as far as i know they could prescribe you something like that though it has been 7 years since i was with camhs so the rules might have changed   i know its all a cliche but have you tried working on breathing techniques i know this sounds odd but i also find putting my hands on a flat surface like a kitchen counter or table can help me feel somewhat safer and more stable when i panic x i dont know about the drugs thing ive never really been around people who do drugs and have only had a handful of occasions where ive tried them had a really bad reaction to cannabis once must have been very strong  with the alcohol though perhaps you could drink in a calm safe environment i presume you go out to drink but it might be an idea to have nights in where you have a drink or two in front of the tvlistening to music or whatever aahh fcking facebook thats such a coincidence that youre experiencing this because this last week i have been massively triggered by things im seeing on facebook what is it thats affecting you are people talking about how wonderful their life is or is it other stuff for me i seem to be getting an increasing number of people sharing photos of animal abuse conspiracy stuff and just horrific news stories its understandably really affected my world view can you not unsubscribe or hide the things that are bothering you i understand what youre saying about the fact that theyre still going to be there reguardless of whether you can view it or not but it might be good to try that because itll be easier for you to put it out of your mind if you cant see whats upsetting you  your anxiety probably wont help you physically no what selfhelp techniques have you tried i know it can be so annoying when someone suggests listening to whales songs or taking a hot bath but sometimes it does take the edge off of things and help you relax  what support are you getting at the moment you said you hadhave depression what help did you get for that x i wonder if it might be helpful for you to see if womens aid offer any services in your area  even though you say youve left him they may still be able to offer outreach support counselling or put you in touch with some organisations where you can get support from people who either specialise in these things or have been through the same thing too   as toastedcrumpet says its definitely a good idea to see your gp too but id also suggest womens aid   im really sorry this happened it must have really shaken you up glad things are more stable in your outerlife now but obviously that doesnt change whats going on for you on the inside  x i have similar issues i am in a lot of pain recently ive been getting chest pain a lot went to the gp and nothing is physically wrong  dont under estimate what anxiety and stress can do to you physically sometimes ive been convinced im having a heart attack but its just an episode of anxiety my gp said that they can give you medication if palpitations were an issue but thats not really what bothers me i recently had an increase in citalopram which can help anxiety so there are meds that might help  just try not to worry i know its easier said than done but the more you stress about these aches and pains the more likely they are to feel worse x are you getting any professional support in helping you help yourself with your anxiety   i think youve already been given some good advice  the only things i can add that help me    deep breathing put your hands on a flat surface and take deep counted breaths when you exhale really blow out hard like youre trying to inflate a balloon and imagine that youre breathing out the tension  distraction i know this is a difficult one if youre already in a bit of a state but try and watch some tv look at a book do a crossword or something can help  put the radio on sometimes when im alone and my thoughts are beginning to drive me mad i put on the radio and try to find a station that has a lot of talking it feels like i have some kind of company and gives me some normal conversation to focus on  think of 5 things that are goodgoing wellyoure grateful formake you happy and keep chanting them over to yourself the other day i actually made myself laugh doing this so i think it can help   obviously these things only do so much and if youre really in the thick of it then its not so easy to do them x i think it might be worth trying to see a psychiatrist or perhaps a therapist might be helpful too  i can relate to getting angry over little things being out of place the way i see it is my brain and thoughts are so chaotic than when i see any chaos in my outer environment it just sends me spinning  obviously nobody here can diagnose you and i dont think i could anyway it sounds as if the social anxiety and selfesteem issues that you said you had in childhood has continued through to your adult life and is creating more and more problems  so yeah my advice to you would be to look up a psychiatrist but to also consider trying to get therapycounselling because i think it might help you to talk x hey welcome to the forum its sounds to me like its due to tiredness especially as youre experiencing it when you need to rest or are about to go to sleep  lack of sleep is so bad for health  not that im trying to preach what im saying is i dont sleep well so i know from first hand experience how bad it can be sometimes i feel like im extremely drunk when ive not slept enough  i would say its just another symptom of the overall situation youre got of dealing with anxiety and being really tired try not to worry to much about it as im sure your counsellor would be concerned if it was something serious am glad that youre finding your cbt helpful and starting to notice an improvement x its worth going to the doctors to get your blood sugar checked another member on here pointed out to me how symptoms of low blood sugar levels can be very similar to an anxiety attack when you get these feelings do you feel hungry or want to eat something sweet it may just be down to anxiety anxiety is complicated sometimes the reasonstriggers for it are so subtle that you dont notice and then suddenly seemingly outoftheblue you get an anxiety attack  so id say it is more than likely anxiety but go to your doctors or even a nurse to get your blood sugar levels and blood pressure checked x yeah i get this sometimes its a regular thing and other times i can go for a while without experiencing it it seems to be very out of the blue i dont think its anything serious i think its probably where your muscles relax as you go to sleep but because part of your mind is awake it goes into a bit of a panic and kind of jolts you what position do you sleep in apparently it makes a difference to this kind of thing x im not necessarily convinced that you are acting weaker than you actually are  it certainly sounds to me like you have depression have you been prescribed any medication for it  also you say youre going to therapy  what kind of therapy are you having  obviously even though you were very anxious during your time with the armed forces it sounded like you managed to get by even if it was with difficulty im sure as well that you had to be very strong in that situation i wonder if now youre away from that you feel youre choosing to be weak because youre not necessarily being challenged   reguardless my point is that i dont think you should label yourself as being weak or lazy or give yourself stick for not being well  the overanalysing thing is very difficult i struggle with it a lot and so i know how out of hand it can get what doesnt help is when i dont keep myself busy or focused on something   if im not using my brain then my brain will start to create things to think about to make itself useful keeping busy can be helpful even if its just by reading or doing crosswords because if im focused on something else im not torturing myself by overanalysing what i said to someone last week   how long have you been having therapy by the way x aww sorry that things arent all that great for you   you are trying really hard and you are doing really well dont hesitate to reach out and get any additional support that you may need i can imagine that it may feel like taking steps back and that must be frustrating and upsetting but if youre noticing the warning signs then in theory at least acting soon should help nip things in the bud before they turn into a full on crisis situation   by the way have you ever tried a green facial primer heres one from boots i know its not cheap but still  no7 colour calming primer green 40ml  boots  im really not a make up kind of a girl myself but putting some of that on my face is very cooling i cant say the difference visually is amazing but it does help cover up redness and blushing  i find when i wear it it helps i think that also because i feel the makeups covering up the redness when i feel myself blush i dont freak out about it obviously thats a good thing the worst thing about blushing is the more aware you are of it the worse it gets  x yeah i can relate  ill go one step further and say that sometimes when im really in a bad place i hate people looking at me recently i was really stressed out and agitated i had to go to the supermarket and i swear peoples looks just felt so invasive i just wanted to shout fuck off and stop looking at me really loud  i cant explain it really they were only going about their business and it was probably just a passing glance and if they were starting at me it was more than likely because i was glaring at them first but it was like they were psychically suffocating me with their eyes yes im a nutter  i think its just a selfprotective thing as bothersome as it can be when you feel yourself getting anxious or agitated its your brains strange way of creating boundaries x thanks for your response crumpet  i know what you mean about the blood sugar thing i used to get that a lot especially when i was taking antipsychotics quetiapine and risperidone used to make me have a low blood sugaranxiety attack but this feels different to that ill just have to take it to my therapist or care coordinator cant remember who im seeing soonest x ok well basically every now and then i get this horrible experience that comes very out of the blue  first of all i start to feel very sick and think im about to vomit  and then ill start to cry its like a cry that makes me want to whinge its unbearable  and my thoughts are usually like i dont want to be alive  and then i have to breathe deep breaths i pretend that im blowing up a balloon strong inhale and strong exhale i have to hold onto or lean against a surface like my kitchen counter eventually after a minute or two it stops   the reasons why i doubt theyre panic attacks are i dont feel like im going to die or that im under threat i feel like i want to die i dont get the shakes with it   the reasons i think they are panic attacks are they come on outoftheblue its a physical sensation that comes on first and then come the horrible thoughts i feel an extreme sense of urgency in body and mind and also i feel unreal   yes i know nobody here can diagnose me but im just wondering if anybody experiences anything similar does this sound like a panic attack x sometimes there are no answers i know thats not much comfort but there are sick people out there who will target anybody the loss of your friend must have really shaken you up do you have any other mutual friends it might help for you to talk to someone else who knew him and feels as shocked as you do do you live alone or with parents if you live with other people  are they aware of whats gone on and are they supportive sounds to me like you really need to be kind and look after yourself im sure its normal to go through what youre feeling though i cant imagine myself because im lucky that not many people ive known have died x is an internship similar to an apprenticeship do you get fully paid or is your training considered part of the payment for your time sorry im not quite sure what an internship is  there is absolutely no shame in making a mistake there is no shame in asking questions if you dont understand theres no shame in needing someone so show you how to do something several times over just to make sure you understand  i just wanted to say that because its completely natural to have these kinds of anxieties  people will be understanding and forgiving of your mistakes because theyll know that whatever it is youre doing is a new experience im sure youre willing to learn and are a good listener i know its not much help me saying youll be fine but always in my experience the thought of doing something along these lines is way scarier than actually doing it x if this has only occurred since your coworkers death then this could be a result of that maybe on some level your mind has thoughts that life is fragile and can be taken from you at any time etc i think someone has said that most fears ultimately are a fear of dying like with the flying its probably not the flying youre afraid of its the thought of having a crash the chances of something going wrong on your flight are something like 11 million to one ive read a statistic somewhere that youre more likely to die because of a donkey attacking you than in a plane im glad the zoloftsertraline seems to be helping you a bit as for the xanax im not sure that thats even available in the uk so not sure what its like to take but its a benzodiazepine so it should help you it will probably send you to sleep to be honest im sure you will feel like yourself again it just sounds like youre having a bit of a mental health crisis and could do with some talking therapy to help you move past this fear of death that youre having i hope your psychologist can make some helpful recommendations  im not really sure what advice i can give but i just wanted to reassure you that things will be fine and that it sounds like the medication youre taking is a good idea for the time being x i think falling sky has a point its worth contacting these friends and asking if everythings ok if they say something hurtful which is unlikely then at least you know where you stand when you have anxiety its easy to imagine the worst case scenario and think that they might not like youyouve done something to upset them etc it might just be that they know youre shy and so they presume that inviting you to a lively party might not be your thing be brave and talk to them youll feel better for it and wont be left wondering whats wrong x hey i had to check your previous posts is the person youre fearful of your former flatmate or have i got the wrong end of the stick  as for your question i think its normal to some extend for people to wonder what happens after you die and to have existential questions however it seems to have triggered off a lot of anxiety for you as well as the social situation youre in who do you see for your mental health are you in contact with any of the services  i didnt quite see the beginning of your story but if youre in danger of people wanting to get hold of you for whatever reason could you not phone the police x ah i really understand how you feel i think of all the symptoms i have depersonalisation is by far one of the most difficult to cope with  have you had your blood pressure checked  a couple of weeks ago i had a major episode of depersonalisation i mean i always have it but this was utterly scary i went to see an outofhours gp because it was a weekend and i was panicking so much i couldnt stand to wait until the monday  anyway she checked me over and it turned out that i did have low blood pressure  in an odd way i was relieved because at least there was something tangible to prove or explain how out of it i was feeling   ive just realised that ive responded to another thread of yours  i really think you need to see a doctor about your anxietydepression im not trying to sound insulting like omg you need help i can just tell youre really struggling and even just a little bit of help is better than struggling on your own  it sounds like youve battled with this by yourself long enough xx the earth itself i believe is a separate entity mother earth will survive anything its humanity that may end through itsour own stupidity    it is helpful to adjust your own thought patterns around it  my anxiety isnt around the world ending because i know it wont end but it can and probably will change drastically im putting my hopes and prayers out there that it will be a positive change  i get anxious about the state of chaos that may come whilst the way things currently are no longer works the bottom line is i fear what people may do to one another to survive but i have faith that there are others out there who will show kindness and compassion because thats what i try to practice myself   thanks for the thread anyway peacewithin i do like your posts  x its really frustrating when people dont listen to you isnt it do you have an advocacy service available to you what do your friends and family think about you do they think youre ill maybe you could get the help of somebody close to you to go to the people who are suggesting you go into hospital and explain that you dont want to go there how do you feel about people saying youre schizophrenic do you relate to any of the criteria sorry if im asking loads of questions i can just see youre upset and want to help x i kind of want to print this off and stick it on my wall  i dont know if you were just writing what what on your mind but this could almost be a poem very wise and lovely words hey how are you doing now i think sleep deprivation plays a huge factor in these sorts of things youre not rested your brain is probably exhausted and so your body is probably making you take short breaths to increase the oxygen to your brain so that it can function better when i dont sleep well this happens to me too i also get ridiculous heart palpitations suddenly i go a little bit deaf and all i can hear is my heart suddenly thumping fast and loud i hope you get some good nights sleep soon i really think itll help you feel better if it doesnt then it might be worth getting checked out as belmont suggested x having a really bad time of it at the moment  i am really anxious and dont feel present at all i dont even know what reality is  anyone seen inception the film yeah its like that wheres my spinning top obviously on one level i know im not dreaming but everything is lacking in dimension   waiting for a call back dialed nhs direct i cant really handle what im feeling any more  i swear somethings wrong with my brain but isnt that what anxietypanic can do  make you convinced youre dying  i cant feel my limbs my eyesight is blurry im dizzy   you know what the most depressing thought is in all of this  i live alone if i were to literally drop dead this second it would be a good few days before anyone would notice it would probably be my mum who phones me to check if im ok now and then nobody else really sees me i dont have contact with anybody else regularly enough for them to know something was up   i dont want to be living alone i never wanted to live alone and this is precisely why im either dying or am going insane and nobodys around to anchor me and help me feel in this reality  i could just float away   sorry for the depressing post im not really looking for advice just trying to distract myself waiting for a call back i phoned 4 and a half hours ago made another phone call an hour and a half ago still nothing someone from nhs direct im going to see outofhours gp at 7pm hopefully they can help me out xx thanks guys for your support  the gp checked me over said my blood pressure was low but there was nothing physically wrong with me i suppose that was good reassurance  i just cant get over what mental health and anxiety can do to you physically so many times ive thought to myself no this is beyond anxiety now something is really wrong with me and im going to die chest pains unbearable headache etc etc    my family dynamic is a different story altogether after seeing the gp i popped into my parents house although within 10 minutes i felt like walking out of the door i did get a nice hug from mum and a lovely bit of dinner and got to make a fuss over my doggies too  so that helped bring me back into reality a bit xx   and dont worry andy you didnt depress me at all it can be a depressing situation being so isolated youre welcome to pm me too anytime x anxiety is horrible its not my main diagnosis but my diagnosis includes with significant anxiety complaints it sounds like its still early days in terms of treatment correct me if im wrong it takes a long time to find the right medication for you and when you do sometimes it just stops working its a pain in the arse i think with anxiety it is as much about changing your thought processes as it is medication mind you having so little sleep cant be helping you at all you have my sympathy there have you been offered any talking therapies yet  as far as daytoday advice goes the sort of things ive found helpful are breathing exercises i have a fan at my bedside table that i switch on so i get fresh air when im lying in bed it really helps to take in some deeper more relaxing breaths i also have a nature sounds album my favourite tracks are ocean sounds and theres another one which is the sound of a stream with birdsong ive read somewhere might even have been a link on here from somebody that listening to nature sounds for 2 hours a day i know thats a lot and i dont do that much can reduce the symptoms of stress by about 50 distraction techniques are always useful whether its art or doing a crossword although you have to be able to concentrate somewhat chamomile tea really helps me i was a bit skeptical about it at first but for me personally it has a really noticeable effect aromatherapy is good too  lavender oil baths etc  its just about finding some relaxation techniques that work for you hope you find some relief it sounds like what your experiencing is really horrible xx as stanogden said its a free webcame based chat thing you can chose to type to one another with webcam on or if you have the snazzy equipment you can talk i suppose the only way he could see into your eyes would be if you started directly at the camera otherwise hell just see you looking at the screen x you may need something stronger it sounds like youre under a lot of stress at the moment do you have any other family members around ie father siblings extended family perhaps you could reach out to them and ask for more support youre obviously in a really distressing situation and so you shouldnt have to feel youve got to cope with it all by yourself ok so you have some sleeping pills to help are you on any regular daytime meds the trouble with sleeping pills is the body builds up resistance pretty quick and they arent as effective its frustrating ive been there too many times what can help me is a nice hot bath and a cup of tea in the bath if the waters hot i find it helps me to take deeper breaths and breath work is essential in dealing with anxiety another thing that helps me is to do some activity that requires your brain to be used and it helps you to not think so much i keep a book of puzzles you know the ones that contain all types of things from sudoku to crosswords i keep it on my bedside table and do a puzzle when i cant sleep because im focusing on that it really helps to occupy my mind another thing is to keep a jotter and note your thoughts down until you get bored of writing yes it most absolutely would be classed as trauma  it sounds to me like you may well be suffering from ptsd im not a doctor obviously but you would really benefit from seeing one rollercoaster what is your current living situation who are you living with is your halfbrother within a close distance to you im quite concerned for your welfare  it might be an idea to also contact womens aid also domestic abuse doesnt just happen between couples it happens between family members too they could offer you any support you might need from counselling to a place in a refuge where you can start a new life hey nikki sorry to hear youre doing through such a difficult time   i dont get thoughts of harming anybody other than myself but i feel so surreal and like the world is some sort of hologram that i feel utterly insane  my thoughts are more around vandalism lol seriously i feel like because theres no substance or weight to the world around me i could smash up anything  a car a shop window my own face  and it wouldnt be real  have you ever seen the inception i kind of feel like the woman dicaprios wife in the film who jumps out of the window because she feels like shes in a dreamworld kind of feel like a i need a spinning top to remind myself that im here   you just have to really keep reminding yourself that this is real you are in reality it may be fuzzy but youre here   recently ive wondered if the amount of time i spend in front of a screen tv laptop mobile etc is contributing to this feeling that im not here and things arent real  as from tomorrow im going to make a real effort to go for a walk once a day if the weather allows im going to take off my shoes and really try to feel the earth around me  sometimes just touching your own body no not like that  can help you to feel physical and anchored in the world give yourself a foot massage or buy one of those body brushes and use it having more body awareness and sensation on your skin can help a lot the skin of course is the bodys natural boundary and so it can help you establish where you and your psyche ends and where the real world begins   as for meds it really might help you i agree that when you first start them things do feel a bit strange but you will get used to them its a small price to pay if it helps you in the long run ha what a coincidence i was listening to their 1hr ocean waves sleep video only last night  has anybody else here tried binaural beats you have to have headphones to listen to them its music in which a different frequency comes out of each earphone it stiumulates the brainwaves and it has a really soothing effect supposedly i havent explained it really that well but if anybodys interested check out the link sleep music relax  delta binaural waves meditation  relaxation  youtube i suffer with anxiety but dont take oxactin and so i cant really relate to your experience or tell you how the meds work  but if you ever want to chat im all ears or should i say eyes   really hope you start to feel better soon and welcome to the forum ok so i think youre going through a combination of depression and anxiety the two can feed off of eachother which can leave someone in a right mess with all due respect it sounds like youre really feeling like your heads a mess at the moment  the best thing you can do is visit your doctor there is nothing to be scared of the sooner you make the appointment and go about getting the help you need the better because if you leave things they could escalate and you could end up becoming quite unwell there is help out there for you its bloody hard work at times but you can turn things around when you speak to your doctor tell them everything youre experiencing its also worth mentioning that your mum has been unwell when you were little because some mental health issues can be hereditary not always but if you have a gene and your environmental factors arent great then it makes you far more prone to becoming ill  be kind to yourself value yourself and speak to your doc so what did the psychiatristspsychologists say was wrong did they offer you any help it sounds like youre really struggling and need some support to deal with things because its affecting your life in a major way oh no its nothing like being sectioned or taken to some facility dont worry intervention is just a word they use for getting involved in your treatment they are intervening and thank you to google p the definition is  come between so as to prevent or alter a result or course of events  they are trying to prevent you from getting to the point where you need to go into hospital  i hope they help you and that you start to feel better soon sounds like youre having a hard time dealing with whats going on in your mind and the results that that has on your body must be really draining to be going through that absolutely im sure this is something that is probably a major factor in your anxiety i dont know what the secret is obviously but if you say its making you ashamed and guilty then its obviously got a big hold on you it must be affecting how you view yourself as a person your selfesteem and that will be having a knockon effect on how you relate to other people  im sure youre going to guess that i think this is something you should talk about with someone do you have access to any counselling services confidentiality is a major part of their job role and so you can trust them not to reveal your secret to anybody make sure you go before you take him out im sure the worryanxiety will only make your crohns worse not that i suffer from it its just what ive heard where do you walk your dog is there a toilet nearby if it was urgent when my sa was really bad and i was asked to do any kind of survey for whatever reason i used to hate it because due to the sa i couldnt find people to actually ask anyway if i can be helpful heres my response   1 do you think slim women can and do look attractive and feminine if not why not yes i think they do and can be attractive and feminine of course nobody is going to please everyone all of the time and people have their own idea of beauty but generally speaking yes they can be attractive and femininity comes from within its not always about wearing floaty skirts  2 what would you think of someone whose body is not perfect that theyre real my body is not perfect even the women who seem to fit the mainstream ideal arent perfect theres a lot of airbrushing that goes on and this makes peoples expectations unrealistic  3 what would you consider the perfect body type to be and do you think there is a perfect body type i dont think there is a perfect body type as long as youre breathing and your hearts beating your body is perfect 4 what do you think of slim women well automatically i thought theyre lucky but i dont think thats necessarily the case to be slim is whats considered attractive by most but of course there are downsides to every body type as i said previously other peoples expectations are unrealistic 5what would you think of a person who is quiet in a conversation im usually that person but when i notice it in others it doesnt bother me at all i understand what it is to be the quiet one ive always been told that the empty cargos make the loudest noise and so the quietness means that your cargo is full  6 if a person does not seem to have knowledge on a topic being discussed in conversation what would you think of them  in a way it pleases me to be able to teach them something new i enjoy passing on knowledge to others knowledge isnt something to be kept secret and turned into power its to be shared among everyone  hope your cbt goes well and start to feel some improvement just take care of yourself too yeah   either way whatever you decide to do  dont hurt yourself any more than is really necessary i know it sounds like hippy dippy bullshit but you need to love yourself because you deserve to be loved oh gosh thats awful for you  are you on any medication at the moment or seeing a professional im wondering if theres something they could give you at night so that you wont wake up feeling as bad as you do  because its really not a common thing i dont want to say normal thing to feel like that when you wake up  its bound to affect your whole day if youre waking up feeling like this and you shouldnt have to live like that hey i have bpd and anxiety too is your partner aware of your issues and how they affect the way that you interact with her sometimes even if you have already had a conversation like that perhaps you need to explain that youre really worried about losing her and that youre sorry that your bpd causes you to act in certain ways  obviously its not the right thing to keep looking for reassurance from her because at the end of the day any assurance you need should come from yourself  have you been offered or are you getting any help for your bpd from a mental health team because unless youre being taugh strategies for dealing with it then its bound to be an ongoing thing perhaps you should also find some selfhelp books ive got some great ones relating to bpd that are really helpful ah theres nothing worse than leaving a meeting with any mental health professional and feeling worse than when you walked in has she not communicated with your specialist have you asked her why shes decided to give you a different diagnosis  it must be really frustrating for you and im sure there must be a part of you that never wants to go and see her again but if shes your only source for help  then eventually youre going to need to see her again how often are your appointments at the moment maybe you should give yourself a little bit of time to reflect on things and work out what you would like to say to her ie you dont feel her diagnosis is correct or helpful and thats shes completely ignored the cptsd diagnosis that sometimes you feel like she doesnt understand you be totally honest as well and tell her that sometimes you dont feel shes listening to you and that her reaction to your talking is patronisingjudgemental  obviously i dont know what shes like but in one of my worst episodes i was a right bitch to my psychiatrist told her she was wrong asked her how many patients of her patients had killed themselves asked her if she bought her degree certificate from ebay and after a few months i got better and went back and apologised she was really pleasant about it and actually said she was just happy to see me better so its not impossible to fix a relationship with a psychiatrist right i didnt realise shed been saying things like this to you when i suggested going back to see her in a while  i think youd be doing the right thing by staying away from her how come you were made to go and see her in the first place was your specialist away ive been told by my psychiatrist that lorazepam is good for getting to asleep but not keeping you asleep and as you probably know its easy to become dependant on it and youll need more to get the same effect but i dont see why you shouldnt take it once in a while if youre having a bad time of it sorry youre having a bad time at the moment selfharm is a tricky one ive gone for years without doing it and then suddenly life all gets too much and ive done it again the trick is not to be hard on yourself  its a coping mechanism when you took an overdose were you suicidal or just wanted to selfharm that may sound like a silly question but taking an overdose doesnt always mean someone wants to die  i think maybe you should be more trusting and open up to the professionals as you said theyve always been against sectioning you in the past tell them that thats not what you want to be honest psych wards are overflowing and they dont want to put people in them yeah selfharm is more about keeping yourself alive than it is wanting to die like i said in another thread dont give yourself a hard time about it until youve learned or found other coping mechanisms youre doing the best you can i think it might be a good idea to write things down that way youre clear on what you want to express at the end of the day theyre there to help and you should take advantage of that fact  do you have any idea of what you want to happen i know my carecoordinator sometimes asks is there something we can offer you that you dont already have it might be an idea to think about what you might like in future whether its therapy or access to local social groups for people struggling with mh issues sounds like your anxiety causes you to overthink massively i could be wrong but i feel like that might be whats going on for you youre so worried and overanalysing everything that youre going around in circles and tripping yourself up  i really hope i dont leave you feeling disappointed when i say this and im sure you already know this yourself but the only person who can stop this worrying is you and i know its not easy its not like theres a switch you can flick on and off  but you know in your heart that you both love eachother and that neither of you are guilty of anything you just have to train your brain into knowing it too   out of curiosity what help have you recieved for your anxiety in the past honestly i dont know if social services would get involved or not ive not got kids or any experience with them i would imagine that they would only ever really get involved if someone felt that your child was at risk in any way from the sounds of what youre experiencing i dont see that there would be any cause for concern in that way  its not as if you hear a voice telling you to hurt your child you dont sound at all violent or prone to outbursts of anger im sure social services wouldnt waste their time  they have far more important cases to worry about im sorry i dont know a great deal but i just wanted to reply and tell you that i dont think you have anything to worry about youre not awful  i can completely 100 understand where youre coming from  i think even someone who hasnt had the traumatic experiences that youve had in the past might feel uncomfortable in that situation  has he ever done that before or done anything else to make you feel uncomfortable why did he hug you were you just saying hellogoodbye or did you say something that might make him believe you were upset at all im just wondering if theres a reason for him to have been more tactile than usual  it could be that he didnt realise he was doing it it could be that it was accidental not that im defending him at all its just difficult to know whether it was intentional or not  if i were you id give him the benefit of the doubt for now as long as it was a oneoff and if he were to do that again id either seriously think about what i would say to him eg im not comfortable with you touching me like that are you aware thats what youre doing or think about telling somebody in your family or your husband how youre feeling   that advice might not suit you and im sorry if it doesnt   you are very entitled to feel like you dont want to give him the benefit of the doubt hes obviously triggered off some painful memories im just saying what i would do it must be difficult for you because yes you probably are more sensitive to whats appropriate contact and whats not but that doesnt mean that what you feel is invalid you shouldnt have to endure something youre not comfortable with because its whats expected of you is there a way that you can make the hug shorter or perhaps hug with one arm and have your body facing away from him if you get what i mean  you really arent stupid and none of what has happened to you is your fault i know thats easy for me to say but other people wouldnt ever judge you as harshly as you judge yourself satnavs are wonderous inventions and once youve made the first journey you and mum will be familiar with the route so it will make things easier its always scary to start any kind of treatment but counselling can really make a difference to peoples lives i completely hear that youre worried and its understandable but itll turn out fine just you wait and see my diagnosis is a personality disorder with significant anxiety so while i dont have an anxiety disorder as such it is something i deal with on a daily basis personally it does sound like you have anxiety as sarah said if its affecting your quality of life and it sounds like it is then its worth seeing a psychiatrist i dont know what country you live in or how your health system works but as you said you would have to shell out money to see a psych im guessing you have control over how often you might see one what im saying is i think you should go for a consultation with one for a single session if its not at all helpful then you dont have to commit i hear you im a complete weener when it comes to the dark   it obviously helps to have the light on when youre asleep so dont give yourself a hard time about it as mentioned above there are older people that are scared of the dark too theres really no shame in it also sleep is so vital to your mental health you need to be rested to even have a chance of feeling well so anything that can make you sleep better is worth doing do you make a conscious decision to start staring or do you find that it just happens also do you find you do it when youre particularly under stress or can it happen whenever i dont think its a medical issue with your eyes sounds to me like its more of a coping mechanism your brain has like its taking mini breaks to make you feel better it could also be dissociation as mentioned which is itself a coping mechanism perhaps you could read up on it and see if you can relate\n",

      "doc: im not sure if what youre experiencing is common when taking prozac or not i suppose it could be more to do with the withdrawing of effexor  how long have you been on the prozac for now if youre still experiencing stiff and trembling muscles and clenched jaw i would contact your psychiatrist mainly to make sure that its not a bad reaction to the prozac which ever med its down to the symptoms youve described sound rather unpleasant so id definitely find out if its what your psychiatrist would consider a common reaction  i wish you well hi and welcome to the forum   you have got so much going on in your life at the moment that even a person without anxiety would struggle i cant give you answers but i can tell you youre not alone and that others here will understand some of what youre going through keep posting if it helps we all have to reach out at some time or another and sharing your thoughts and worries really can help i get it with answering phone calls i hate it when the phone rings and have disabled my answering machine and my providers answering service so that nobody can leave a message on my home phone this said im more than happy to text or email  i dont know the best way to overcome this do you have a friend or family member with whom you could practice for want of a better word instantly texting and emailing you could do it while in the same room as that person so that they can encourage you it might sound silly but i was just thinking along the lines of desensitisation also i often find the more i do something the easier it becomes hi cuddlybear and welcome to the forum   ive not experienced this but im aware that gad can affect you both mentally and physically i would imagine that the tension and aches are tied in with feeling on edge perhaps you are tensing your muscles more when feeling this way its just a thought  hopefully others who have experience with this issue will come along with a more helpful response  take care hi guybrush and welcome to the forum  sorry to hear of your worries and the impact its now having on your relationship i think it would be worth trying a counsellor or therapist it could help with your obsessional thinking and perhaps having that alloted time to talk about it would alleviate some of the need to go through it over and over with your girlfriend  i wondered too as you talk about a timeline that you keep trying to work out if actually creating a timeline on your computer assuming you have one or something similar might help im thinking along the lines of creating a document that you can save and add to as you remember things that your girlfriend can access if she feels the need to you could make the past an unspoken subject and do it all via your computer  i hope that makes sense every time you feel the need to discuss or disclose something you can go to your pc and type it all out you would know then that you wouldnt need to tell your girlfriend as if she wanted to know she could look at your timeline  it might sound like a silly idea but at the moment its the best i can manage i agree with the other responses here i think itll be a bit of a wait and see type thing  perhaps the colleague has experienced this personally and is just giving a warning of what they think will happen of course this doesnt mean that it will definitely happen to you on the other hand it may be a rumour started by a disgruntled member of staff who didnt like the manager in the first place there are many scenarios that could have led to this comment  i wouldnt worry about it just carry on as you are it sounds as though youre doing really well at work and that you get on with your manager sorry youre feeling like this flowerpot it sounds as though you have a lot to deal with and that youre at the end of your tether im sorry that i havent got any specific advice for you i just wanted you to know that someone else is here  with the mental health services i think youre right on both  too many ill and not enough staffservices to cope with it all i dont know that it matters how loud you shout  you wont make anyone low by sharing your worries and issues were all here to support each other so vent as you need to i hope things get easier for you hi miss chaos77 and welcome to the forum  ive not taken cipralex before so cant help with that specifically but as somersetscorpio said most side effects will improve within time i think i went through the worst of it for about a month with my meds but still get a couple that have stayed with me over the years  sometimes it just comes down to a case of weighing up the pros and cons just keep an eye on it and if the side effects become too bothersome talk to your gp about it  im glad the cipralex is helping with your anxiety and hope that the side effects ease soon i dont think that this is necessarily a bad thing or should be viewed negatively i had to go through the dreaded medicalinterview which was awful the only person i know who didnt need a medical actually received a decision in their favour obviously i cant offer consolation based on just one person but i hope it goes a little towards making you feel more relaxed  waiting for a result is probably the worst part but as cpuusage says if you get a decision that you believe is wrong then appeal  i hope you hear back soon with a good result hi jensdad and welcome to the forum  if youre getting suicidal thoughts you really do need to talk to your doctor about them there is help available and with the right treatment you can start to feel better again  please dont leave it too long before seeing your doctor again suicidal thoughts should always be taken seriously write it all down and hand the piece of paper over if you really feel unable to talk about it  could you phone the samaritans rather than email this might help are you getting any help with your drinking   hope you feel better soon when were suffering there doesnt have to be a reason and if we cant understand how or why were feeling a certain way those closest often get caught in the crossfire for want of a better expression  please dont consider self medicating and please reconsider seeing your doctor again i know how difficult it can be to face them and really if you are not finding himher sympathetic then would it possible to change doctors you shouldnt have to be going through this with no extra support but that will mean opening up i wouldnt know possibly the issue i see is using any drugs psychotropic or otherwise unless theyve been prescribed for you i just wouldnt go there  i really think you have to push past your phobias and worries and stress to your doctor how you are suffering dont be fobbed of with unhelpful comments and dont worry if you feel as though you shouldnt be persevering with it we are all deserving of help and support but have to sometimes muster all our strength to get started youre bound to be scared i think any of us would feel the same i do hope all goes well and your surgery is a success its a completely sad and soul destroying joke isnt it the entire process is so longwinded and seems to be aimed at causing suffering to those who need the most help i despair i hope you manage to get the answers you need tomorrow do let us know how you get on im so glad that the call was more positive than expected and that you are now feeling some relief hearing the result before christmas would be great i hope you can manage to relax a little fingers crossed for you please try not to feel too guilty look at it as a break that is much needed at the present you are worth so much more than what you can provide for your family and im sure they want whats best for you and just want you feeling better  i dont think any of it seems silly being cheated on in the past is bound to effect your selfesteem and can have a lasting impact on your life if you wont go back to the doctors sooner then maybe try looking at your two weeks off as time and space to think about what help you need and to start writing down some of your main concerns  if youre feeling no better after the two weeks go back to your doctor with whatever youve jotted down and talk things through with him a good doctor can make all the difference but he cant help you properly if youre not open with him thank you i hope youve had a good day too its great that youre still not drinking and that youre feeling better during the day night times can be some of the hardest and loneliest to cope with but were here to help if possible  im glad that youve decided to go back to your doctor if you need to i know personally that putting off getting help when you really need it is one of the worst things you can do  good luck with your progress hi lollipop75  ive nothing much to add to the good advice already given but i do understand how you feel and some of what youre going through i just wanted to say a quick hello and welcome you to the forum i think that most of us here can probably relate to your issues to some degree or another i have made and lost friends over the years some of it due to isolating myself at times and some because of my erratic behaviour    you should have no problems making friends here and while perhaps no substitute for real life friends it would get you back in to communicating with others and can be used as an outlet for sharing your thoughts and feelings without having to feel self conscious i wish you well   by the way welcome to the forum ive only just read this thread  i was wondering why you hadnt been around lately   i do hope youre feeling better than you were and just want to wish you a speedy recovery oh yahtzee sorry to hear of your struggles and that you feel so alone unfortunately many mental health illnesses and disorders go hand in hand with isolation andor feelings of loneliness  are you receiving any help or treatment for your depression or anxiety  by the way welcome to the forum i hope that being part of it will help you to feel less alone thats not good i would imagine thats putting you off seeing anyone again for a while do you think youd be able to cope with a talking therapy such as cbt i suppose its difficult at times to know what will make you feel better and what makes things worse that sounds like a good plan i hope youre feeling stronger and more stable soon particularly at home perhaps talk about how youre feeling with your family they might think that theyre helping and may be totally unaware that things have become worse  take care it can include that yes my oldest son suffers badly with social anxiety and hell do anything to avoid talking to others hes sure people think hes rude because he can be quite abrupt and appear offhand at times whereas in reality hes just really embarrassed or nervous much of his depression stems from his social anxiety its pants my daughters partner uses a light box though im not certain of the make hes found it very effective for sad theyve also replaced their living room light bulbs with daylight ones   several people at my bipolar support group also recommend replacing light bulbs and have found it very helpful i personally find them too bright and as with foxjo they give me headaches   everyones different but it might be worth giving it a try nothing ventured and all that by the way welcome to the forum goodnight monopod sleep well sorry youve had a bad day hi bethamyy and welcome to the forum  i would say if you feel as though you need help with your issues yes go see your gp   we cant say whats wrong with you to use your expression but we can hopefully offer support and maybe advice  if you feel awkward or anxious about what to say to your doctor why dont you print out your above post and hand it to them to read it explains what youre going through very well sorry to hear that youre still feeling so anxious about your friend and her other friend i responded to one of your previous threads about the same thing and can only reiterate what i said then  i really dont know what your friend can do to reassure you any more than she already has perhaps you just need to prepare yourself for their return you know how hard its going to be for you so maybe try to come up with some coping strategies to help get you through whilst your friend tells you about her time away   it might be a good idea to avoid facebook for a while too it sounds as though facing it might be too stressful perhaps think about taking up a new hobby or interest to distract yourself  i hope that you find some way to ease your anxiety over this  take care and a good name it is too i like it excellent its pants feeling used and unappreciated by people in your life perhaps after a time they will realise how much you do for them and it will be possible to have a more even relationship that said sometimes for your own sanity the only thing you can do is break ties  i hope youre okay hi jack and welcome to the forum  it does sound kind of anxiety or selfesteem related to me leaving school starting college worrying about your career concerns about your future having an operation etc can all be quite stressful and knock your confidence once you start worrying about things it can be hard to keep it contained  have you talked to anyone family or friends about how youre feeling are your parents supportive people because your operation coincided with you leaving school and then starting college its hard to tell if thats where your problems originated perhaps it was a combination of events  i think that understanding whether youre just a natural worrier or if there is an underlying anxiety issue comes down to a matter of severity and how you cope if your worries adversely impact your life and effect your daytoday living then its wise to seek help i know this isnt as easy to decide as it sounds   you were obviously worried enough to seek help on here so maybe thats a sign that you do need some support with what youre going through  calypsos suggestions of counselling and mindfulness are definitely worth looking in to there is a lot of helpful information on the internet too  i hope you start feeling better soon hi kardia and welcome to the forum  sorry to hear you are suffering so it really does sound as though you need some help   sleep deprivation can cause many problems alone would it be possible to have a lock fitted on your door or perhaps start putting something against the door so that access is restricted or something that would wake you if the door was opened alternatively do you have any family or friends with whom you could stay for a while  so sorry to hear that you suffered abuse too having to see your attacker at all must be quite awful and stressful have you ever had any counselling or therapy for this are you receiving any treatment or help for your depression and anxiety hi  sorry you are feeling this way your friend has reassured you that nothing will come between you and if you value your friendship you have to trust that   just because she has another friend who sounds as though she really needs support at the moment it doesnt mean that youre forgotten pushed out or not important  also whether this other girl wants to be best friends with your best friend or not is totally irrelevant having new or other friends doesnt make our relationships with existing friends any different we have the capacity for many people in our lives  it does seem as though you are taking a huge interest in your best friends life instead of concentrating on your own life and happiness perhaps try to focus instead on what you like and enjoy doing  i hope you feel better about things soon i know its not easy to let things go when anxiety kicks in hi ldigi1 and welcome to the forum  it does sound anxiety related particularly as his tests came back clear and he checks his blood pressure and heart rate several times a day its so easy to slip in to habits that get a bit out of control and become almost obsessive before we know it  im just wondering if some of his symptoms are caused by his medication has he discussed how hes feeling with his doctor if hes taking klonopin for his anxiety it doesnt sound as though its working too well perhaps a change of meds or dose is needed i dont know i personally think that for anxiety talking therapies help more than just medication  perhaps your boyfriend needs to go back to his doctor and tell him that the medication is not working and that he needs more help and support   although it shouldnt be the case i think doctors will take more notice if someone goes in with the patient to stress how bad things are would you be able to go to the doctors with him hi megan and welcome to the forum  i think part of what you are experiencing is quite normal youre bound to have certain thoughts and emotions about your husbands ex she caused some issues but your husband as you say yourself was also naive and basically did as she said she also still has a connection with him as she has his children  you seem to view her though as someone who has everything sorted which is highly unlikely and someone who you wish you were or would aspire to be she might appear strong confident and happy to you but basically shes just another person with her own worries troubles and insecurities as we all are has your mini obsession with her got worse since you and your husband hit a rocky patch is it related at all  i think the first thing to do would be to stop looking at her facebook page easier said than done i know if you cant avoid facebook altogether then every time you get the urge to check her page out do something else every time you start thinking about her do something different to distract yourself   if you start taking little steps you should hopefully find that more and more time goes between thinking of her until shes not such a big part of your life i dont think anyone will be offended by your post also i think being scared that you cant get well is a common fear fortunately you have motivation which will hopefully keep you going  having mh problems certainly doesnt make parenting a breeze when my children were very young i did what i could to hide everything i was going through from them they just thought mummy got ill a lot and as they grew older i explained in very basic terms what was happening i was lucky enough to have a very supportive family too  having children changes the way you view everything or it did for me all of a sudden the most important people in the world were these two little babies i had twins who were totally dependent on me my responsibilities changed immediately and thoughts of myself apart from staying well were pushed to the back of the queue  just put everything youve got in to getting better a lot of this will be trial and error but youll find something that works eventually the next step is then discovering which coping tools and strategies work to keep you well  i hope that helps a little if you have any specific questions i dont mind having a go at answering them hi kelly  a belated hello and welcome to the forum  i hope all goes well with your appointment tomorrow let us know how you get on hi evolutionarysleeper and welcome to the forum  sorry to hear youre going through such a bad time  i think if youre going to see your doctor you should be as open as possible theyre not going to be able to get a true picture of things unless you tell them as much as you can im pretty sure they wont cart you off in a straightjacket  im sure your mum and dad dont think bad things about you it sounds as though they care and are trying to be supportive   i dont think youre a monster to me you sound like someone whos confused experiencing odd thoughts and wants a bit of help  let us know how youre appointment goes  i wish you well its weird isnt it almost like we have to accept or allow ourselves certain liberties so that we can cope with them without feeling bad  i was the same a while back along with my depressive episodes came terrible guilt for sleeping too much it wasnt until my psychiatrist explained that after a high i needed the extra sleep for my body and mind to recuperate that i felt better about it  its a strange world  i hope youre okay sorry to hear youre feeling like this clive its pants for sure  hopefully there will come a time when you are feeling well enough to escape its never too late  not sure about the becoming a vagrant part mainly because i wouldnt last 10 minutes but i think when we feel the need to get away anything seems better than the situation were in  i hope youre feeling better soon hi samboo and welcome to the forum  sorry to hear about the troubles youre having im wondering if you dont think its associated with your anxiety and panic attacks whether youve had tests for any physical problem  i only mention it because i suffer with asthma and i can relate to the feelings you describe of not being able to catch your breath and feeling like youre suffocating which is sometimes a lot worse than others  its just a thought hi hutton and welcome to the forum  im glad you found the strength to post here having such obsessions must make life extremely difficult at times   it gets a little quiet on the forum at this time of night but there are many members here who im sure will be able to relate to your issues  were all very supportive anyway so i hope that you continue with your story as and when you feel able to i love coffee and im quite tolerant of caffeine but it can sometimes make me feel very jittery i would imagine that its effects are more pronounced as youve been caffeine free for months ive done the same before i take someone with me and it definitely helps if its somewhere you cant familiarise yourself with first just ask somebody to show you to the room and then when youre about to leave ask that person to take you to the exit im sure theyll be helpful and will understand  im useless with directions so usually end up asking for help anyway i think its a good post and one that will be of interest to others here   there was a thread not long ago about certain physical illnesses or allergies causing symptoms that doctors thought were mental health issues for which antipsychotics were prescribed its quite frightening really it must be a horrible thing to go through but hopefully youll feel reassured once youve had your routine test in a few days  the trouble with anything that were worried about is that it makes us about 50 times more aware of it and it almost becomes obsessive   have you tried any distraction techniques for whenever you start thinking about your heartbeat as youre going to sleep have you tried listening to music the radio or a cd or reading a book so that you can concentrate fully on that i find that music mindfulness is quite helpful i hope it works for you if not it might just be a case of trying different things and finding what suits you best  this might sound silly but i sometimes use a problem of sorts  more often than not a cryptic crossword puzzle that i cant solve  and try to work it out as i go to sleep i think it works in a similar way to the music something to concentrate on and lose yourself in for a while either that or i just bore myself to sleep   anyway let us know how you get on  take care hi dee sorry to hear youre still worrying about pregnancy   youve already received some very good advice here and i think it would be well worth following i just wanted to reiterate one point and its the same advice i gave to your previous pregnancy worry its totally 100 impossible to get pregnant this way no ifs ands or buts it just can not happen  please try to stop worrying about it hi pelennor and welcome to the forum  ive not personally come across anything like this before i might be wrong but i think there was a thread a while ago that was not too dissimilar regarding lying andor denying events had occurred it might be irrelevant and not connected to your friends problems but ill see if i can find it i wouldnt hold your breath ill look tomorrow as i really need sleep at the moment  i know when i have suffered with delusions in the past that my family was told to neither completely ignore them nor to reinforce or validate them something along the lines of yes i understand that you feel that way and believe this at the moment but in my opinion this is not correct i dont know if this helps at all or if this is still seen as the best way to deal with delusions but i hope you manage to sort things with your friend  good luck that sounds awful and must be difficult to cope with i must say ive not come across anything like it before but hopefully others on here have and can offer some advice  as all of the tests youve had have come back fine have you discussed with your gp whether this could be a mental health issue or not oh my im not sure if its ocd or not i honestly couldnt say ive never come across anything like this really all i can say is that i personally have no worries about or issues with toilet paper where ever i am hey sorry to hear youre feeling worse than you were  googling isnt always a good idea theres so much conflicting evidence out there that its no wonder you feel more confused than ever   we can connect to other people male and female and feel love for them as friends without feeling anything sexual towards them i personally think that if you were gay you would have been sexually attracted to men by now which you claim you are not please try to stop worrying about it all sorry youre going through this   it sounds like the panic attacks one of my sisters gets she found cbt very helpful have you spoken to the doctor about anxiety or what to do if it is a panic attack i hope you manage to get to the bottom of it soon  by the way welcome to the forum i dont need wiki i already know its how i conceived my third child sorry to hear of your problems relationship troubles and the end of a relationship will obviously have an adverse affect and can compound further feelings of depression and anxiety my depressive episodes involve a lot of sleep  as the others have suggested i would recommend trying counselling again or any talking therapy do you feel able to go back to your gp and discuss this maybe it would be an idea to go for a med review anyway i hope you are feeling better soon  by the way welcome to the forum hi squirtle and welcome to the forum i hope youre finding it of some use  sorry to hear of your issues they sound very debilitating at times i personally think it sounds more like an anxiety issue than a personality disorder  that obviously is just my untrained view based on what you have posted others may see things differently   i hope you dont mind me asking but you mention heavy drinking is this a regular occurrence  i think discussing things further with your psychiatrist is the best way to go you explain yourself well and obviously have good insight regarding your feelings and behaviour i wish you well im so sorry to hear you are feeling so very bad that suicide seems like an option to you please think again this time of year can make things seem so much worse when youre already suffering  i think that the whole people talking suicide equals not doing it is a fallacy many of us will have hit that point i know i have on more than one occasion and its hard to think forward or to be positive about anything you are too young to have failed at life and i think you just need another chance you deserve another chance  please go to your doctor or the hospital and tell them you are feeling suicidal there is help out there please dont give up i care too if your doctor is not listening to you change doctors make an appointment to see someone else and tell them you are suicidal you dont need to talk about the rest of your worries to begin with just stress that you are suicidal and need help now there is support available and you deserve some happiness and help to feel better   a lot of what you said in your previous post sounds very similar to what my oldest son has experienced he suffered very badly with social anxiety counselling and a course of cbt helped him a great deal and taught him to learn to cope with situations in a different way that was two years ago and he hasnt self harmed since surely its worth trying again to get the help you need please try if your doctor has recommended it then yes i say go for it youve nothing to lose and possibly a lot to gain sorry to hear that your anxiety is causing such issues it must be very hard to cope with you have some very good advice above from misskitty i just wondered have you spoken to anyone about how youre feeling at the moment have you taken or are you taking any medication or seeing your doctor for your gad sorry for the questions just trying to get a better picture of how things are that sounds awful and must have been terrifying for you have you suffered with panic attacks before i would imagine that its mainly your anxiety making you feel this way do you generally get on well as in are you close to your brother i suppose how you feel about him and what your relationship is like or has been like in the past is bound to have an impact on your behaviour too  i would say hes more likely to forget about things if theyre not drawn out but again it depends on what type of person he is are you aware of clinging on to things at the time or is it just when you think about it afterwards sorry to hear of your struggles lovagemuffin paranoia is a horrible thing to go through and i know how hard it can be when there seems little hope and no light at the end of the tunnel   im glad that you have your sister to think of and i hope that you are soon feeling a lot better dee you cant get pregnant from a toilet seat end of the men are just getting a little carried away amusing but carried away   i thought your main worry was getting pregnant at all if you have sex with someone and then find out youre pregnant then thats how you got pregnant its all irrelevant dee it really is i can assure you that it is not possible to get pregnant from a toilet seat or from something you touched regardless of who has done what   please try not to worry as i said if you have sex and get pregnant then its because youve had sex and not for any other reason it might if its having such an adverse effect on your life which it obviously is then maybe cbt or working on some mindfulness would help theres lots of help online about both it may be worth checking it out first and seeing what you make of it not a fan then im not saying youre crazy at all its a very real issue for you and we all have issues the fact that i have not come across it before doesnt make it any less valid and i honestly cant believe youre the only person going through it    i think that it is worth looking in to therapy particularly as your doctor has suggested this its the same with any problem that anyone has  its about finding something that works for you you dont need to suffer as much as you are and i sincerely hope that you find something that helps sorry that youre having such a rough time with your thoughts and worries it can all seem so overwhelming and hard to think straight when your mind is bombarded with too much at once  really though youre just overthinking things everyone has worries and concerns within relationships but it sounds as though youre taking on the stresses of it all at once and prematurely just try to relax a little and be yourself rather than this person you think you should be  your girlfriend is with you because she wants to be with you and loves you for the person you are theres plenty of time to be thinking about living together and marrying when the time is right you probably wont even question those things  women dont want bad guys or supermen we want someone we can trust love and care about and receive that in return  i dont know if any of this will help but i hope you manage to relax a little and feel better about things soon hi tansjzdf and welcome to the forum  as your social anxiety has such an impact on your life i would say that getting professional help might be a good idea would you be able to go to your gp or college counsellor about your issues i would suggest gp first my oldest son suffered terribly with social anxiety when he eventually saw his doctor about it he was referred for cbt which helped him in many ways hi  im obviously not a doctor so can not tell you what you do or dont have but i seriously dont think youre going crazy you sound as though you have pretty good insight and are very aware of how youre feeling perhaps too aware i dont mean that to sound condescending or wrong i just mean that it could be that you are becoming so very anxious and worried that you do have a serious mental health problem that you are noticing many things which you may have shrugged off or not taken any notice of at all at one time sometimes reading about too many mental health issues can cloud our judgement too and we can start twisting symptoms to fit in with our experiences im not saying this is what youre doing at all merely stating that it can happen  i hate to say it but if you dont think that youre feeling this way because of your anxiety you really do need to talk to your gp in fact i think it would be wise to talk things through with your gp anyway i know you said you cant do this but maybe you need to look at it a different way and put things in to perspective for starters a gp is highly unlikely to diagnose you with schizophrenia  they would refer you for an assessment also worse case scenario if you are suffering from a serious disorder would it be better to go to your gp for some advice and a referral or hit that breaking point and end up in a psych ward you might go to your gp and find that your problems do stem from your anxiety which could then be worked on  theres no shame in mental illness and i hope that you are able to seek help and that things arent as serious as you are expecting take care hi zozo1  i havent got anything useful to add to the good responses you have received already but i just wanted to say a quick hello and welcome to the forum do you think its your anxiety and depression causing your inability to concentrate  my nephew had similar problems in class and he used a dictaphone to record what the tutor was saying in class so that he could listen to it again in his own time could this be an option for you have you told your tutor that youre having problems you dont have to ask them to talk slower but if you discuss your issues they might well have some advice of their own it would be a good idea for them to know anyway awww monopod no we have probably all said things we dont mean and later regret when were ill or in a bad way and its usually the people we care about the most who bear the brunt you certainly dont come across as a bad person and your post reads as caring and worried definitely not the traits of a bad one im sorry i cant offer any real advice i just felt sad reading your post and wanted to respond nothing wrong with strange quirks unless they impact detrimentally on our lives  what im trying to say i think is that if its really bothering you continues to get worse or is having a negative affect maybe talking to your gp about it would be an idea if its not bothering you too much and youre just looking for some insight or information im sure youll find it here   ive been trying to teach myself how to be a grown up for many years my children tell me not to bother anymore lol ill have to remember that  its going to be added to my top tips list  all of a sudden im feeling hungry hi   just wanted to wish you well for tomorrow i can relate to how youre feeling and how difficult it can be pepecats suggestion of headphones is a good one it might relax you as well as act as a distraction   anyway good luck hi im new here too  it seems like a good place for support and help    although i dont suffer with the same health issues i can definitely relate to the part about keeping things hidden because you dont want to worry anyone  i find it shocking that your therapist seems to brush off your feelings particularly if youve mentioned suicidal thoughts or ideations  is there anybody else you can talk to about this say your gp or a friendfamily member  i believe that thoughts like this should always be taken seriously maybe stress the seriousness of your problems again to your therapist and question her about it  i hope this helps a little  just wanted you to know that people here are thinking of you hi and thank you  its quite daunting when first trying to find your way around on here but at the same time comforting    ive read a couple of your posts about the issues with finding a good therapist and really it must be awful  they are supposed to be people who you can trust relate to and confide in  actually that should be the least you get from them  im quite lucky in that respect  i hope that both winterfall and yourself find therapists that behave as they should it must be really difficult frustrating and probably makes you feel quite alone but youre not   im obviously not qualified to give proper advice but i wonder how you would feel about writing things down and taking them in to show your therapist  you could even print or copy out what you have typed here in your posts  it might go some way to explain how youre feeling without having to actually say anything  it may not appeal to you but i have often found presenting either my previously written word  or at least typing out a list of things i want to say  more beneficial than relying on myself to say the things i want to at any given time i say its worth a try  nothing ventured nothing gained and all that  i often write down how im feeling just to get it out of my system  it doesnt work for everyone but it helps me sometimes  the night time and demons although its probably little comfort at the moment i think most can relate to that  sometimes the night time is a blessing its peaceful and quiet nobody will bother you or phone or need your attention  other times it can be the most terrifying saddest and loneliest of places to be  although new here i feel that this forum is a safe place to be  you can relay your thoughts and fears and know that someone is listening and empathizing  you are not alone\n",

      "doc: this is going to be difficult to ask or explain but i try keep an open mind and sometimes it helps to get another point of view or side to a problem and hope someone can help there are three families whos children are growing up and out on their own living nearby they are very badly behaved and anti social children and parents three of the neighbours have put their houses up for sale because of all the trouble and its like everyone is under siege from them  one of the boys who has been labelled as the ring leader is supposed to have some kind of behavioural problem but all of them are unaproachable and just shout insults and threaten people its really awful  i cant help thinking though that if the boy does have a problem it must be hard for his parents they have four more kids but does it excuse whats going on and for them and the other parents to not bother either or is it easier to just ignore and leave everyone else to get anxious and stressed people are frightened to try and stop them but want to be reasonable thanks misskitty theres no talking to the parents and i dont know them or even how long theyve been here to be honest someone said one family is known to the police   other neighbours are fed up of it all too and have tried to accept and be nice to them but its not working and im very anxious and stressed out with them not everyone can up and move out though including me  the parents just dont seem to care at all and im sorry if they cant cope or arent getting help with their problems and just wanted to try see in a way what it might be like for them but dont understand and its half term next week nightmare thanks fallen i think everyone is too scared too do anything i went out to the children one night and wasnt nasty but made some excuse going out to the car they were a bit hostile but not bad but it didnt last long though its awful being frightened in your own home yes  they have been causing damage to peoples cars and houses threatening and swearing and are frightening its boys and girls the attitude their parents have is bad too its not good at all  i dont know and cant understand how they live like they do but then think im being a snob which im not at all thanks misskitty thats the problem being careful word soon gets round and everyone knows someone it doesnt take much to point the finger even if its not you that does anything things are bad enough without all this i just hope someone else does something soon i feel sick and frightened pathetic letting kids get to me like this but at least i know am not alone its constant fear and harrasment terror im so upset with it all sorry x thanks fallen glad you think im not a snob and decent i wonder sometimes and try tell myself not to be such a grumpy old cow x theyre out its been quiet all day until now im shaking again thanks topcat i dont think there is anywhere like that here and everyones frightened of contacting the pcsos but think and hope someone will complain soon i keep having to stop myself from going out and shouting at them which would be the worst thing to do and think is what they want really think im going to go put the tv on now so cant hear them hope youre feeling better take care x sending s too am glad youre feeling better anouska x hi rose4  to the forum x hi alesha im sorry not have any advice but hope you can find someone to help and be ok x hi  to the forum x hi jordo and welcome to the forum it doesnt sound trivial but is an awful lot to cope with and agree with going to see the cab and trying to find a more understanding gp   with paying bills in situations like this as long as you keep in touch and explain whats going on and make some kind of payment until your back pay comes through they should understand and accept whats going on hope things get better for you soon clouds x hi liz and  im sorry youre struggling and can relate to what youre saying  mine isnt so much agoraphobia but social phobia but i understand the not feeling happy and relaxed at home too it can and does get better with the right help and support  is there a different gp you could try see or speak with waiting times for therapy can be quite long but it wouldnt hurt to ask about it again  i hope you dont feel so alone being here there are lots of us who understand take care clouds x hi deimos sorry youre in pain again is there anyone that could go to the dentist with you to help put you at ease a bit or can you phone them and explain how anxious youre feeling about going in but need to see the dentist if you think theres any possible infection or the pain isnt any better please try go get it sorted being in any kind of pain can be exhausting and make anyone feel more run down hope you feel better soon x hi deimos im sorry youre anxious and feel alone have you tried contacting mind or the cab to see if they can advise or help your gp might be able to help too if you can speak to them try get a telephone appointment first if they do them and ring samaritans if you need to over the weekend they can only listen but sometimes it just helps hearing and speaking to someone  please take care and keep posting if it helps x hey tina youve had and are still having to try manage with so many things its not surprising your body is reacting to all the stress and anxiety as well x  i lost over two stone had awful stomach upsets and sickness couldnt eat the annoying thing is worrying about having stomach upsets on top of everything else but it can and will get better  xxx hi bearandmoon i dont know if this will help but i often wake up with a churning stomach and feeling anxious about the day ahead and have found it helps to get straight out of bed and go make a cup of tea or coffee then it kinds of stops me from laying in bed and worrying more the lighter morning are making doing it easier and dont know if you work or have other commitments or can rest in the day but it might be worth a try x hi gajolene of course i remember you and have wondered how you were doing sorry youre not so good but am here if you want to chat xx i dont know if this is agoraphobia social anxiety or both but can walk and go out into the countryside or quiet places and be ok or fine even but cant walk down the street or in town and busier places hardly ever and its got worse over the past few months noise makes me panic a lot too  is agoraphobia really more a fear of whats on the outside rather than a fear of the outside itself   thanks  clouds x hi lucretia and thankyou for being lovely x its not nice thinking everyone is watching and laughing or judging and am sure theyre not but understand feeling like it sometimes x hi mk thankyou youre right about alerting system the hyper vigilance had lessened a lot but is back now even in the house dont think i could wear ear phones because of having to listen for danger all the time and  the effects of too much stress and need for peace and simplicity makes sense too x hope youre both ok and have a relaxing weekend  xx hi cloudberry a caravan sounds like a great idea and im glad its helped do you have any idea why travelling west is more difficult  my friend offered to let me use their small motorhome but trying to get insurance was nearly impossible and way too expensive when we did find somewhere maybe one to think about for the future though  hope you can get out and about to some nice places while the weathers good hi rubybegonia  to the forum i think im right in saying the mental health forum originated in the uk and although many members are based there people join and participate in the discussions from all over the world or stumble accross the forum whilst browsing looking for information and advice caravans are known as trailers in the usa not sure if motorhomes are called the same as well as gad and social anxiety i have a number of issues going on diagnosis including clinical depression but dont think now agoraphobia is one of them  its only possible for me to go in coffee or other shops away from where i live with the exception of braving the supermarket and one other shop very occasionally  we the gp psych support worker do know the underlying cause and reasons for these fears and illness two years of therapy helped and medication since late last year still sorting out  thankyou for your kindness tips and advice i do appreciate it and hope you are keeping well its nice to meet you clouds x and welcome x hi sophie92 sorry i dont have any wise words but can relate in a way to how youre feeling up until a few years ago any kind of public transport wasnt a problem at all now i cant go anywhere without the car on my own i think somersetscorpio is right in that if you can identify and know what the root cause of your anxiety is it would be a start in working on it and not letting it hold you back either from getting on  is there anyone that could go with you on short journeys at quiet times by train or bus with to rebuild your confidence or can you look into seeing a different therapist maybe who can give other advice to the one before as it was a while ago i have travelled by bus but not on my own building up slowly hope you can overcome whatevers going on and follow your ambitions for an exciting career and future take care and good luck x hi madsheep ive just seen your post and well done its not easy doing everything youve done today agoraphobia isnt just about going outside like a lot of people think but coping with what is out there when you do and you have very well and should feel proud hope you dont mind me chipping in take care clouds youre very welcome try not to worry the building is alarmed and registered with security  saying out loud yes its done secure or whatever should help register and alleviate any doubts or worry hi alberto welcome to the forum and congratulations on your birthday thankyou for sharing your story and am sorry but

and sorry if youve tried already please take care and keep posting if it helps clouds x youre very welcome i know its hard but try not to be embarrassed when the gp first referred me to cmht i didnt know what was going on how they could help and was very anxious it didnt help that id worked with mh teams before in my job even though it was a long time ago  sometimes its easier to speak to someone

being here helps too and you start feeling better soon take care  clouds x hi justchecking i dont have ocd but the best way ive found is too try keep calm concentrate and lock a door turn a tap or plugs off whatever it is and say out loud locked done off i have to do it with the cooker boiler windows etc and even if have to check and say it again it seems to work sorry if thats no help or youve tried it already x hi dan and welcome to the forum  im so sorry about your mum youve been through an awful lot and it sounds like atm your self confidence is low and sleeping patterns mixed up  could you try going to sleep and getting up ten or fifteen minutes earlier say do it gradually and discuss your medication and possible referral for therapy with your gp or pdoc sometimes it takes ages to find one that suits better i tried lots dont worry about talking to yourself unless you really feel its affecting or worrying you like shaky says your most definitely not alone with doing that  its great that youre wanting and trying to do things and  looking toward the future positively dont give up and hope youll find being here and talking helps take care clouds x hi littlethings it sounds like youve a lot of stressful stuff going on is anyone helping and supporting you with the dwp tribunal  there are people and organisations that can help you dont be afraid to ask if you havent already and get advice and people here to talk to like taff has said if it helps  take care clouds x hi auntvickie im sorry not to have any advice but just wanted to welcome you to the forum  x hi molly moving to somewhere new always takes some getting used to even if you have family or know people there  could you try going out and meeting someone a short distance away at a park or caf and then them go home with you or the other way round sorry if thats not a good idea and dont know about the cmht and gp the cab might be able to help thinking of you take care clouds x hi worried93 and welcome to the forum i know this temp job might not be ideal and  am sorry youre feeling anxious and scared but my friend and daughter both went on to get full time jobs after temping it helped a lot with their cvs and getting the experience so might be worth giving it a go if you can one of them got a permanent job where they were temping  is there anything you can take or do to help distract and keep busy with that might help you sleep too im sure the employers wouldnt expect anyone to go in and be able to do everything straight away and cant tell you what to decide but hope it goes well whatever you do good luck clouds x hi coffeelover has anything happened thats made you feel like this that you can think of it sounds silly but even something like lots of car doors slamming or people outside can make me really on edge x  i dont think youre whining or boring either fallen its hard really hard sometimes true and genuine friends dont make you feel like sht or abandon you when those who you thought were always going to be there leave and arent after almost a lifetime it hurts and leaves lots of questions but do you know what theyre not worth the worry or time if thats how it is  peoples lives change they go on to do different things or not but anyone who intentionally hurts anyone or anything whatever the circumstances is best left to it that sounds unkind and probably wrong but you dont need or deserve to be hurt anymore xx hi bert i dont feel exactly like it but maybe in a way bed and inside home with the curtains shut is like a safe place but going to ground hiding  when i can get to somewhere out in the open that is safe i love to look up at the sky and everything around its like a big window opening and being able to breathe or move without feeling afraid they might be little adventures but can be so good hope youre ok xx hi lx sorry your anxiety has been worse over the weekend finals exams and the run up to them can be a very anxious time  the only thing i can say is some of the advice i remember being given to students here and you probably know already try eat and drink well take some extra vitamins if needed and organise study into bite size chunks with breaks in between something relaxing away from the books if you can getting some fresh air even opening a window or standing outside on the porch or garden hi shades and welcome to the forum what you are saying and describing does sound very familiar and am sure does to a lot of people here too but try not to worry its good you have friends that can go out with you do you have any support or help from your gp or a support worker too  mind or the cab would probably be able to advise and help you if you havent spoken to them already i hope youve managed to get more sleep and someone else here might be able to give better advice when they can there are lots of sub forums here including ones for ptsd and gad and lots more hope youll have a look and post some more take care clouds hi hannahlous28 and welcome to the forum sorry youre having difficulties and sorry cant tell you whats happening but have had something like it happen before  was there anything in particular that brought on the panic attack that you can remember and is there anyone that can walk with you and your kids to school at all to build up your confidence again  you must of worked very hard to overcome panic and the agoraphobia in the past and hopefully with the right help and support from your boyfriend gp support worker or therapist if you have them youll soon be back on track  hope the forum will be useful and of help too take care clouds hi lincoln how you doing hope youre feeling a bit calmer and are ok x dont worry about not going so long as you feel safe and have something to eat and drink when you can its so awful being panicked by the thought of going out into public sometimes but is and will be do able again  i hope the doctor will have some ideas and be able to help you on monday thinking of you x thankyou for all the hugs and replies i dont know what was going on and got in a panic had a restless night but have been asleep today xx thankyou catkin the robbing evil miscreants wont get in here  xx this sounds very silly but i feel frightened someone has just been knocking on the door my dog keeps growling i darent go out even with my rifle no one knocks on the door at this time of night hi fallen thankyou i dont know my dog is still growling if its a neighbour or friend they would shout through the letterbox to me looks like its going to be a very restless night armed and ready if needed x thanks fallen and youre right with my dog picking up on anxiety they all do i think more then we realise sometimes and for warnings geese are good too  i think whoever it was has gone away now but dogs have been stolen here and in the surrounding area recently its very worrying and am on guard more then ever x theres someone out there going out to look hi sorry mk but i replied to another thread before reading your reply to this one and said some things a bit the same in it an interesting article cpu but i darent say anymore the supermarkets always one ofif not the worst for getting crowded in or herded then being trapped and shoved by someone behind you at the checkout and the person in front getting a load of money off vouchers out then a dispute over them if something can be such a bad shock that it causes great trauma or anxiety wouldnt it make sense that a good shock or unexpected or new or sudden something could work to turn things back again and take away the trauma or anxiety or whatever hi oobiemoobie thanks yes winning the lottery would be a pretty good shock i sometimes think that if someone one day said pack an overnight bag were going somewhere and then we went to some new place that i never would have thought and stayed did and saw different things that were so beautiful and good it would make me feel better and be so good it took away all the bad  sorry im going into one of my dos againlol hi mk i suppose what im thinking is if something can change someones life in such a bad way why cant something change someones life back in the other direction  im thinking of selling the house and just taking off into the unknown but towards and where i might find some answers and chance of escaping this even though i love my remaining family more than anything  hope youre ok and do get a surprise valentine trip or present x hi unwell thankyou i dont know if it does or not  there is a man in australia who rescues orphaned kangaroos near the town city of alice springs he seems so devoted and love his life and what he does so much without modern convenience or a wife and children thats very special and two ladies in the town who rescue them too  ive left it too late and will never see or experience any of these things unless im very brave very soon and do something hope youre ok today hi dita85 im glad you saw it too and thankyou x is someone who cant stop grieving really mentally ill or is it the loss is too much and genuinely leaves them broken hearted sorry but i cant stop thinking about this now and dont what anyone can say more hi cazzh im sorry and dont know if its anxiety but its good that the doctors done blood tests some of what youre describing does sound anxiety and season related or both this is just from personal experience though and in no way a diagnosis at all did you tell the doctor youre taking st johns wort it is a powerful natural remedy that doesnt always suit everyone or mix well with other medications its hard to say anymore but hope youve got some support around you and someone here can help more soon take care and people do understand lots of things and feelings x what happens if grief and ptsd turns into anxiety and depression as well everyone has different ways of grieving but there is supposed to be stages of grief and sometimes they only get so far and cant move beyond a certain stage  there is a television programme next week about a young soldier who was traumatised  so much by what he saw and experienced he couldnt go on its very sad he had some counselling from the army but his mum doesnt think it was enough  im going to try watch it not sure sometimes i think the world has become too complicated basic and fundamental but good and meaningful most important even if simple things are lost and forgotten  maybe the world has to rewind in more ways then it realises to be civilised and survive there is but people arent doing enough with the time and information the message still isnt getting through our world and planet doesnt depend on us and what were doing to survive it depends on everthing thats being destroyed by us i know you hate going to doctorsim the same but well done for making the appointment they will hopefuly be able to do tests and put your mind at rest  i had and still do get similar symptoms to the ones youve described and was worried sick had ecg xray and blood tests and they came back clear hope very much its the same for you i didnt believe that anxiety etc could cause such physical symptoms but think they must do sometimes now not saying its the same for you but understand how worrying and scary it can be its best to get checked out though sorry thats not much help but hope you feel better soon x hi meercat i dont like pills either but sometimes they can be good and im glad youre feeling settled and calm in a nice bubble  sorry not to have replied to your other threads but have been thinking about you just didnt know what to say were ok here thankyou and feeling pretty calm too tonight x sorry topcat and hope you dont mind me replying but some of what and how youre feeling is what was described to me as hyper vigilance  being on guard and alert all the time even at home but more so when going out  it is very tiring and finding ways to cope is harder sometimes than others but you will and can do it  hope you feel better soon try not to worry topcat youre doing your best and very well with everything mks right and i cant really help as much but hope you can have a relaxing evening take care clouds x youre not stupid or dumb misskitty far from it xx wish i had the guts to do it last year here a dog ran out of the park on to the motorway and was runover when fireworks were going off it was midmorning on a school day too and another woman with her dog fell and broke her hip trying to get away from kids throwing them about theyre a menace a couple have just gone off and im starting to shake already because theyll get worse it must be kids messing about but they make me really anxious and my dogs not too keen either why do they do it theres nothing wrong with enjoying a quiet academic side of life and keeping an open mind and is something that a lot of people dont understand and are probably missing out on lots even if not academic sometimes being quiet and still and opening the mind to new ideas and experiences gets lost i worked in an office full of women that thought i was a nerd but i thought they were lol x hi misskitty this might sound silly but one of the things ive found to help is smells good smells an aroma or scent perfume that reminds me of nice things from better times  it might be a bit like the old fashioned smelling salts but in a nicer way some aromatherapy oils or a solid perfume with them in to keep with me help kind of therapy is also helping as an alternative to meds most of the time theyre not right for everyone am not sure about herbal tablets youd need to check up on them and with some oils as well i think hope you can find something to help soon hi big g your dog isnt ignoring you but is a good listener youre welcome i babble too mostly to myself or my dog or a piece of tree in the corner hi big g that must have been scary and very painful and hope youre feeling a bit better now  sounds like youre having to cope with a lot and are doing really well they were a good ambulance service to check you out so well and hope things get better for you soon  sorry im new but just wanted to say hi and hope you have a better night hey bigg dogs are the best arent they i wouldnt leave the house if i didnt have one your boy sounds lovely and good company its good you can both get out and enjoy the top of the hill together  hope youre doing ok hes lovely and youre daughter is too for looking after you im sorry youre in so much pain and not getting much sleep feel better soon and go for a slap up meal with your daughter  im ok thankyou but its one of those nights when dont know what to say very much but want to say loads but dont know why or who to am a bit tired and dont like sport on tv hi big g how you doing i hope the new anti depressants will help you feel better its awful when non of them work or have horrible side effects  today im angry brooding and have spoken to only my dog and piece of tree and shouted at the notice that keeps popping up on the tv to re tune it for all the olympic coverage and press the yellow button to get rid of it guess which one i did  its bonkers hi wendolene26 hope you are ok now sorry i dont know how to stop panic attacks all the time but started to in the shop today and of all things focused on a packet of chewing gum at the checkout stand  i didnt want to reply before because it sounds silly but it did work clouds hi when will it end i think anxiety and stress can have an effect on physical well being too like jippy tummy from being nervous or head aches and things  if im in a real state the chest pains start and bad headaches stomach churns the list goes on but distraction and trying to be calm deep breathing when it happens stops some of it  one thing i have found is that once the doctors know you have mental health problems and you go with physical stuff they blame it on the stress a lot of times but should get things checked out to be sure reply was posted twice\n",

      "doc: hi stresshead  firstly i noticed this is your first post so welcome to the forum   im so sorry to hear that you are struggling so much at the moment you say you cant tell anyone what youre feeling and thinking because theyll think youre crazy well youve told me and i dont think you are crazy i think that you are confused and youre scared by your thoughts which is something i would guess most members here have felt and continue to feel i do think that the most important thing for you to try and do is to be honest with your mother about your thoughts if you find it difficult to tell her face to face maybe you could write a note and give that to her i would also strongly suggest that you go to your doctor and explain what is going on for you it might be as simple as increasing your medication slightly or changing your medication we wont know until you go to the doctor i think both of these ideas are important because you are worrying a lot about your thoughts at the moment and its undoubtedly making you feel worse which may make the thoughts more intrusive because youre even more stressed  its very good that youre keeping yourself occupied during the day as that really does help maybe at night you can read to try and distract yourself however as ive said i do think talking about this is the best way to solve the situation they wont think youre crazy theyll just understand as i do that you need some extra support right now   i hope tomorrow is a better day for you x personally for me i tend to get more anxious when im not as low in mood i guess because i can only focus on so much so when i am at my wits end with my depression and bpd etc i have no excess room to worry significantly over things and also i care less about the outcome of things when i feel lower however if i have to think about something when im really low my anxiety will go into overdrive my anxiety always tends to be there but my heightened anxiety seems to be more when i have things to do or something on my mind or a visitor coming basically not when im laid in bed wondering how im going to make it through the day i hope that made some semblance of sense lol though i highly doubt it  hope youre okay hi strawb3rry  im also agoraphobic so i understand what you mean with this its bad enough not feeling able to leave the property to go out and about like most people can but when your safe place no longer feels safe its unbearable i dont know what i can really suggest as i havent made much progress myself but can you call your doctor and ask to speak to them over the phone all the professionals who work with me know i dont leave my flat so if i need to talk to my gp i do it over the phone else id have a panic attack i dont even know if that could be a possibility for you but i thought id offer up my experience anyway incase it helped if you do have to go to the doctors do you have hands free on your mobile so you can talk to a friend while you drive there it would still be stressful but at least youd have some support  just ideas im sorry things are tough for you hugs just to let you know im thinking of you lovely oh and in the hopes of raising a smile to your face  bernard mannings lol hugs for you xxxxxxx heya  is there any tricks youve learnt about trying to control your anxiety ive been told of some which havent personally worked for me but have worked for many people ive encountered some people use to count to 20 method to try and control the breathing and lessen the panic and others try to envision a positive outcome to their fears and worries in an effort to lower the anxiety and feel calmer you may have already heard of those and im sure other people have much better suggestions than mine but i just wanted to offer you my limited ideas in a hope to help  im sorry youre feeling so anxious at the moment your way of thinking that if something good happens to you something bad will happen too and that you dont deserve to have good things happen to you isnt a great mindset to have im sure you already know that lol but maybe you could think about therapy if youre not already partaking in it so you can explore these thoughts and self beliefs and get to the bottom of them i feel the same way about myself and have not yet embarked on therapy but i know that it has literally transformed the lives of others and helped them really move on  just an idea anyway hugs no anxiety is not a matter of life or death but it is scary and frightening and something that is not very nice to experience  saiten im glad to hear that your belly breathing helped even a little bit today and that you thought to try that technique while you were feeling such anxiety  as for your thought process youre right breathing techniques wont change that which is why i suggested therapy i do understand that you feel reluctant to try therapy again and i get why but maybe it might be worth a shot feeling uncomfortable talking about things can be worked on as well you dont have to try and muddle through everything on your own  anyway i hope youre feeling better at the moment understood however i was talking in response to the posters anxiety issues not anxiety in general  saiten i hope youre having a better day today heya  i dont have much to add to foxjos post as i agree with what theyve said i just wanted to let you know that i can relate to how you feel i often have panic attacks and have an anxiety disorder and it can be really debilitating but by the sounds of it youre doing well i understand it may not feel that way but please try and give yourself credit for the fact youre still going to work it is important to continue as it does provide routine and something to work your day around i wish i was able to work as i do think it helps i will just second that its really important to go back to the doctor maybe write down how youre feeling how the anxiety affects you and just try and reiterate that you do need support you shouldnt have to do this alone anxiety is a scary thing to face for anyone and heightened anxiety is unbearable keep posting here too you are heard and hopefully we can all help each other hugs hi beth  yes customer services must be difficult at times i used to be a nursery nurse and when i was at my lowest while working it was a nightmare so i can kind of relate to that i truly hope the doctor can help you  my doctors surgery has the same ringthesameday policy its bloody stupid  and please keep us informed  feel free to pm me if you need to chat or whatever   black rose xx\n",
