      "doc: everyone is here to listen if you need to speak or vent what exactly is making you feel overwhelmed this is usually how my anxiety and depression starts out crying and feeling like everything is just too much    maybe i can help you its been the same with me thought she was a friend shes stabbed me in the back and used everything i have ever confided in her and reason to make the managers think im useless just feel so stupid i would love to be able to take it to someone but obviously i feel like they already have had her side of the story and who knows how many years of her turning them against me   i need to find another job because im going to end up on long term sick at this rate its just so annoying as my old jobs i had good friends and i used to actually enjoy it but now i just go for the money and try not to lose the plot  not sure if it will work for you but it did for me   i needed emergency surgery so didnt have a choice in the matter  that said it was nhs so i still waited 2 days during the 2 days i listened to surgery hypnotherapy and it really calmed me down could be worth trying sooo my tooth is bad i think a bit of it just came off and its been bad for a while so sensible me is forcing myself to phone for an appointment tomorrow then anxious me is panicking already just booking an appointment is going to be a huge step for me but going along alone is terrifying i have bad memories of the dentist pulling my baby teeth out so its right up there for me on my fears i know a filling isnt too bad my tooth isnt hurting so if he wants to try do anything else im going to be strong and refuse and ask him just to fill it    as i type my leg is pulsing as im stressing about it i cant even keep my mouth open when i go its like it clamps shut uhhh    does anyone have any coping mechanisms im not on any medication could a change of job be the best plan you sound like you are stuck between a rock and a hard place with regards to discussing your issues with it where i work the sht floats somehow i will be honest i finished my therapy course and have tried to put it all out of my mind which worked in the short term  i had been active in another forum about completely different things i voiced an opinion and started an all out war basically because they didnt like my opinion to be logical and sensible about it my opinion was nothing it was like i hate the colour red in the realms of importance i wasnt saying i love trump or anything really controversial   long story short i got myself upset and deleted my account   i think it shows a lot about how far i have come since my treatment normally i would just keep going back and defending myself but i got to a point where i just said what am i going to achieve  i had previously seen how they jumped on people who wanted a rant and basically told people who were clearly upset that they were in the wrong so why stay there putting up with it its people like that who have made me ill in the first place   also today i had an email from our high up boss which i basically took as her trying to vindicate her feelings of me being useless by pointing out i had done something wrong even though i hadnt done it and its not even my teams work all day i berated myself then this afternoon i decided maybe she sent it because i do get things sorted   not everyone hates you somethings i find really hard to believe   how is everyone else doing thank you means a lot i have a plan im place for a relapse i feel very aware that this will happen at the moment and this feeling of being ok is a blip im trying to block it out and rationalise things as much as i can to try keep myself sane i feel a lot like its my choice to stay happy or to be sad which i suppose is something a lot of people would love to feel and to choose being happy but it doesnt take much for my thoughts to sour and the paranoia to set it lets just hope a good dose of sunshine helps cheer me up and boom we are back i drank too much last night and think i had some kind of mental break when im that drunk i scare myself because i feel like if there was the opportunity i would jump   i dont know whether im just paranoid or what but my oh doesnt get it hes very factual he cant understand when i say someone made me feel bad if they didnt say something but sometimes it can just be their tone or the fact they stood round in a circle conspiring to go home and leave me   i feel stupid every time too because i give them the benefit of the doubt then they hurt me again   i just wish i could find a decent new job with lovely people yea i really shouldnt drink    i punched a toilet roll holder i was lucky it wasnt one of the people i was with really i am so proud of myself today   my therapist made me list things that made me anxious and rate them 110 she asked me to try do some of the smaller rated stuff and work my way up well today i did a 10 the dentist i was terrified my lip was shaking haha but i tried to breathe through the fear   gotta go back for fillings which is gonna be another 10 but just gotta be brave and remember how good i feel that ive done it defo speak to someone i hid everything for years and it made me worse  when i get really upset i hyperventilate or stop breathing completely i try breathing exercises to calm me down totally tune into your breathing and be calm this is what the professionals are there for dont suffer alone had cbt on nhs for a couple of months i am starting to get my personal life back on track but work is terrible still i started bawling my eyes out over nothing the other day just felt so undermined by something which really shouldnt bother me but it did    just wondering if anyone ever truly recovers im desperately seeking a new job as i do think my work is the root of all evil i used to be so confident and i feel as if they chipped away at me bit by bit over the years  before this my ex cheated and lied to me and i think the combination of the 2 has turned me into this obsessive worrier and i hate it   also if anyone has any tips on how not to cry or get stressed at work i try all the breathing exercises that normally work and try to quiet my mind but its this voice telling me im no good which keeps going round and round that gets me thanks  i did bring it up but i just cant manage to get my practices in normal life to work in work its like i go to crying and shaking before i can be calm and breathe when i told my therapist she did kinda side with me about work that getting a new job is the best route as the people sound awful which in a way is good because i know i have a tendancy to catastrophise situations and think worse than it is but this is terrible    for example someone told me one thing knowing it was wrong to make me look like an idiot and when confronted she just laughed said oh well and turned round smirking i have learnt from my therapy that this isnt paranoia obviously thats great for my mental health but not really for my work situation  i think you might be right about being discharged it certainly hasnt helped i will talk to them next week see what they say thanks everyone your support and kind words are really helping especially as i have till next week to wait for my appointment i went shopping this morning really early and my paranoia and anxiety levels were right back up i almost cried in the car because of the feeling of slipping back    trying to remain positive today another job has come up that im maybe 80 qualified for and could certainly blag the other 20 as i know people who do this job and they dont have the experience or knowledge i do just need to try big myself up for once on a cover lettercv i am just disappointed i know we all have set backs in life but this event along with others this week just allows me to add fuel to the fire of the problem being with everyone else and not me   i used to be so strong i could be horrible to people when i had to be i would never take any sht from anyone and now i feel like i walk round with mug on my head i let people take advantage of me thank you for replying   to list   i have an alcoholic on my team who my manager refused to deal with  we just had pay review and someone who does no work just got promoted and someone who is a complete idiot has been promoted to my manager this is the moment thats caused me the panic ive been here twice as long as them and i basically feel like they stuck 2 fingers up at me   i tend to catastrophise things so in my head its like im gonna have a breakdown or im never gonna find another job i just feel so sick i feel like i should just go home sick to be honest i have suffered from depression for years as long as i can remember and recently diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder i have a lot of things going on at the minute which werent really helping and i was referred for cbt which i thought would be brilliant and was my 2nd last session was this week my therapist wants to discharge me because she thinks ive made amazing progress and i have i did somethings happened at work and i feel like ive been shot in the chest i had a panic attack on the way home ive been suffering from loss of vision in my peripherys and today i feel so tight across my chest i barely slept and i keep crying hysterically ive basically gone back to how i was prior to any treatment   i dont feel like im a danger to myself or anyone but i have the overwhelming feeling of not wanting to be here i would never do anything but its like i want to run away or something  i tried to be proactive applied for new jobs but then the anxiety and panic kicks in  what if i dont get any of them what if they are worse   i dont know what to say to my therapist next week in my last appointment at the minute i feel like just caving and getting on medication i just want to feel numb     please help or send advice its completely unworkable we were friends i feel betrayed and stabbed in the back shes a moron she cant even speak just mumbles has no confidence to make decisions makes the team paranoid with all her batching and basically is just the worst choice ever    i dont feel like im catastrophising this specific situation its pretty much as bad as it gets but certainly the worrying about finding something else is right up there   also i do have an appointment with an optician about my eyes as it was available quicker than docs appointment   i just dont want my therapist to think a shes just trying to get more sessions  b  shes completely lost the plot now   uh im just so frustrated i feel like i am back to square 1 this is where i started only my breakdown material was less serious i went hysterical over something breaking in the house cried for hours and hours and just couldnt stop at least this is something real i suppose today im not good my body is shaking  clearly on some kind of adrenalin overload nothing has happened just the same old but im sat here so annoyed i just nearly broke the printer slamming stuff around and i cant speak to anyone i feel like im screaming inside   i have too much work to do theres no one to help and i refuse to spend a minute longer in here than i have to so i wont do overtime but the work has to be done so im contemplating whats the worst that will happen maybe i could just go home but then i cant i cant leave the few good people with all of that to do the bad people wont have to do it anyway uh i dont even know what i want you to say nothing will help will it i havent spoken to anyone all day i just cant face it i feel so paranoid at the minute too i have slated this person who got promoted and feel like they are all talking behind my back when they might not be ok so i am back update spoke to therapist about work agreed i need to find a new job and i have an interview in a couple of weeks im so excited  slight anxiety about interviews and the thought of leaving a permanent job to go onto 18 months probation period ick but im hopeful that a new environment might help as i never had anxiety this bad in previous work environments i actually remember a time being happy in my old job wow    im still on verge of being discharged from therapy i feel a lot more positive about it at the moment but yesterday i felt terrible completely exhausted with worry and thoughts circling anxiety about everything tried to work though my plan but nothing would help am i just going to get days like this wow its quite nice in a weird way to see these things arent just happening to me certainly reducing my anxiety    panic attacks   difficulty breathing  like the air is stuck and my body wontcant let it inout  hysterical crying   sweating  ridiculously bad bladder  need to go every 5 minutes  palpitations  heart fluttering  for some reason i had this past couple of weeks then when something really bad happened never got them  maybe worry related rather than factual events   inability to speak  dry mouth sudden lisps or stuttering  vertigo  why i rarely get drunk who chooses this  visual disturbances  new one for me  over eating  i think when i feel most anxious i eat more which makes me worse because my tight chest gets tighter and fuller which causes more anxiety  reading your post made me feel so sad for you i have avoided and ran away from stuff most of my life too my grandfather died of a heart attack and i blamed myself for so long losing someone that quickly is always going to have an impact  what i will say is feeling depressed every day i do have thoughts of no being here but i couldnt do it for my family  and i dont even have kids i find it easier to focus on others when i feel down just know its not a reset button and theres no guarantee of peace you probably crave a friends mother took her life last year and seeing how hard that was for her made me realise i just couldnt  just focus on the good days we all have bad days some more than others i just hope you can find some happiness soon xxx thats lovely to hear u stay strong im similar at work my colleagues who are customers i get on with amazingly they think im funny intelligent and chit chat with me and tell me all sorts of details about their lives my colleagues in my office probably hate me i cant be bothered with them they probably wonder why i turn on the charm with the staff from other offices how i get on so easily and so well with them    i dont know how to help in this situation just reaching out as someone with similar experience you arent alone i like the work the people are terrible yup i agree there  i find myself questioning people daily  why do you think you have the right to hog the middle lane to go through a red light to expect me to move out of the way sit and do no work expecting me to do it all   i think thats how ive become so introverted the older i got i just cant be bothered to fight them all anymore i used to think 90 were good and now ive realised 10 are good i often find myself wondering if people are just npcs and thats why they are always doing these things because they dont have a choice\n",

      "doc: it took me a long time to stop reflexively saying yes when asked for a favor to stop volunteering myself for things i would rather not do etc  giving in to people who want something from you can be a compulsion and if you dont learn to overcome it itll drain you mentally and financially  eventually i realized that if i didnt learn how and when to put myself first i was going to get really burned out helping everyone else  when it comes to strangers who ask for help i learned to remind myself that you cant save the world  helping out a little when you have the time and means to is all you should expect yourself to do  theres nothing to feel guilty about if you say no to someone   panhandling is a numbers game  people expect to get turned down or even ignored by a lot of folks so theres no need to feel like youre delivering a personal rejection if you cant or dont want to hand them some cash   everyone ive ever given something to on the street has been extremely grateful regardless of whether i handed them 2 20 or just a fresh meal weve got a few homeless people in the areas near our apartment  sometimes i see someone on my way home so i pack up either a serving of whatever im cooking for dinner that night or a couple sandwiches plus a side salad andor piece of fresh fruit and maybe a can of cold soda and then go back out to drop it off  this guys behavior is a huge red flag   i wholeheartedly agree that he sounds like some sort of scam artist  he knows how to pick out and target people who have a hard time saying no then push them until they cave and does so with a sociopathic lack of concern for his marks  while you didnt mention or even hint about him doing or saying anything threatening i wouldnt be surprised if  in the back of your mind  he somehow made you feel like something bad might happen if you just told him to bugger off and leave you alone even though you had no logical reason to feel threatened  if you did it was all part of his manipulative mindgames    if i had to sum up what that guy did to you in a single phrase it would be psychological mugging   to remind you to summon up the strength to say sorry my bus is here and disappear onto it the next time heres some things to keep in mind    just because someone is homeless doesnt mean they cant also be an hat    you work hard for your money and need it to support yourself  if you give money to someone it should be a gift out of the kindness of your heart  not an obligation because the person wont take no for an answer    you are a good kind person and you deserve to be treated with respect    sometimes its ok to treat others as they treat you  if a total stranger is rude and demanding of you then giving them what they want reinforces that bad behavior and encourages it to continue  by blowing them off youre sending the message that you find their behavior unacceptable which it definitely is in this jerks case     learn to embrace your sense of righteous indignation  recognize when someone is trying to take advantage of you and give yourself permission to get a little bit angry about that  think to yourself how dare you demand more money when ive already offered you all i have  let that anger and the adrenaline that comes with it overpower whatever it is that normally traps you in such situations so that you can walk away    sometimes its easier to jot down a fake phone number than to refuse to give them your number  heck if you want to be a little bit sneaky and devious give them a real number that isnt your own  for example the number for a homeless shelter or psychiatric helpline or perhaps your local nonemergency police number     it may help to think to yourself what can they really do if i say no and walk away  their only options are to move on and go bother someone else or escalate to physical violence the latter being highly unlikely but something its always good to be prepared for  having a way to defend yourself just in case can give you a confidence boost in situations where youre anxious and unsure about what might happen next   many folks carry an easily accessible can of pepper spray personally ive opted for a 25 pair of steeltoe girly sneakers  theyre cute and unassuming  no one would ever see them coming  while i really hope i never need to use them its reassuring to know that a swift kick in the shin would drop pretty much anyone to the ground giving me time to get the heck out of there  best of all theyre kittenapproved\n",

      "doc: im sorry youre dealing with this i dont know if youre going through something stressful in life right now but often our body responds in odd ways to stress when you start feeling the dread try breathing deeply listening to soothing music and drinking water it seems simple but it really helps thanks for being so brave and sharing youre not alone many people deal with the fear of associating with others i dealt with social anxiety for years someone told me that whenever im in a crowd to remember that most people are worried that when they meet new people they will be rejected think of everyone as scared and you dont feel so alone im sorry that youre going through all of this thank you for being so brave and sharing i grew up in a home where my parents fought like crazy finally my mom and dad got divorced it took me a really long time to realize that it was not my responsibility to fix my parents marriage i know you want to help but the best thing you can do is speak to a counselor about your feelings in all of this i dont know why your mom is staying in the marriage if she is so unhappy but you cant carry the burden for everyone give yourself some rest you deserve it keep hope thanks for sharing this time of year cause anxiety and depression for many folks youre not alone the overcommericalized rush that our society has created has really taken away from the peace and joy this season is supposed to be about in the past i got overwhelmed trying to create that feeling when i realized that instead of focusing on what i dont have or dont like about the season focusing on the good really helps try volunteering at a childrens hospital or maybe at a homeless shelter giving not material possessions really takes you out of the rush and puts what youre blessed with in perspective what youre describing is not so uncommon many of us deal with weird anxieties regarding how other people view us the important thing to remember is that your happiness cannot be in another persons head overthinking about what other people are thinking about will drive you insane i know i did it for years finally i decided one day to not let other peoples expectations hinder me i hope you find the same freedom\n",

      "doc: hello and   i agree with bee  youre struggling with something thats one of the most stressful and distressing things people can go through  dont beat yourself up for suffering  please be kind to yourself right now  gad will obviously make things harder for you because the anxiety and dejection that comes from a break up is enough to knock most relatively stable people on their arse  youre not weak you have within you the strength to cut ties find that sense of closure you need and move on  you owe it to yourself and itll only take you properly realising that to turn the corner  i hope you can find that sense of closure soon    do whatever you need to do to get it as well  if you need to talk to your ex and say whats on your mind before you can let go then do that  equally if you need to cut himher out of your life and even people associated with himher do that  do whats best for you  it should all be about you right now im so sorry youre having to face all of this shit from people who dont know what the bloody hell theyre talking about  people are very quick to judge depression but anyone whos actually suffered from it would never treat anyone like that  please remember its not your fault that you cant work and that youre doing a lot of good in your community by being there for other people  im currently working and im glad my tax money is spent supporting the people who really need it hello and welcome to the forum  im so sorry your neighbours are making you feel like this  no wonder youre sick with anxiety  is there any way you could get out of the situation    have you told the council or the police about what theyve been doing  the best advice ive ever heard about stuff like this is document everything  keep a journal video them make a video diary record the noise on your phone take pictures   that way if you have to prove what theyve done at a moments notice you can  also have you been in touch with your gp  they might be able to help you in the short term in terms of eating and sleeping while you sort yourself an escape plan  really hope you can get out of this awful situation soon and that your anxiety can be lessened there are antidepressants you can take that have an antianxiety effect too  im on fluoxetine and i cant remember which kicks in first the antidepressant element or the antianxiety element but that might be something to consider with your gp  id go in and ask for some valium too dont know if they prescribe that but still maybe talk to the police  its antisocial behaviour   im so outraged for you that youre having to put up with this situation aww im so sorry  maybe some counselling alongside this will help  hope you can feel some relief soon hello and    just tell the doctors what youve told us you might even want to print out what youve written here if you struggle to get it out into words  that way the doctor will know how youre feeling and how much youre struggling and hopefully theyll be able to give you the treatment you need right now   wish you all the best  university can be a very difficult time   i think going to the uni counsellor is a very good idea  theyre easy to access and you dont get that at any other time in your life im so sorry to hear youre struggling with this  i hate feeling that anxious  its like torture     im glad your boyfriends so supportive  hes right  the job isnt worth making yourself absolutely sick and miserable for  youll find the rent in some other way   clearly freelance work is too distressing and detrimental to your health at the moment  dont feel guilty about that im so sorry youre struggling like this and im really glad youre finding some help for your issues   im going to speak frankly in the hope that i wont upset you and if i do make you feel bad im genuinely sorry  im saying this from the perspective of someone whos also dealt with serious anger issues and has hurt others in the past  i know  from experience that the sooner you take responsibility for it the quicker you can both heal  with that said  your reaction to her not having sex with you could be having untold damage especially if she is bipolar  if someone had that reaction to me not having sex with them i probably wouldnt ever have sex with them again id feel as though i was having sex with them under threat  its really good that shes understanding about this  but you seriously need to sort that out you cant pressure a woman into having sex with you that way  its really damaging  i know you dont mean to hurt her because your reaction is the result of feelings of rejection that are too much for you to handle right now and your reaction does not make you a bad person  but you need to think about what this is doing to her  also not allowing her to have friends constitutes abuse  again this doesnt make you a bad person  id suggest taking a break from the relationship so that you can focus on your anger issues and start again by relaying the foundations of a relationship and building trust again with her slowly  unfortunately your anger is meaning that youre breaking a few unspoken rules of relationships because youre not on a solid foundation of selflove and selfawareness  these unspoken rules basically dictate that you must treat the other person with respect if you follow that feeling youll find yourself not treating your wife in the ways you describe  your judgement about this has been skewed by your anger issues but you need to find this sense of clarity before you can rebuild your relationship with your wife and i do sincerely think it needs rebuilding from what youve said  a break might not be necessary though  i hope you can get over these issues fast because you do love each other and everyone makes mistakes  were all struggling and please dont ever feel that you are in any way a bad person youre just dealing with too much right now and you need to take time to heal     you should go and see your gp immediately  i dont know what combination of therapy will work for you but i would suggest going down the route of medication and talking therapy that seems to be a good combination for most people  id definitely look into anger management asap  i hope everything goes really really well for you and i sincerely hope i havent made you feel like shit  youre doing the right thing everythings looking up from here hello and   im so sorry youre experiencing this  it sounds very distressing  ive been through a period of having agonising panic attacks daily so i really feel for you  my suggestion would be to see a gp about your mental health rather than physical health  i think perhaps focusing on the physical side of it might make you more scared that theres something physically wrong with you whereas if you get counselling for example you might be able to cope with your panic attacks better and that might lessen the effect or the occurrences of these attacks  for dealing with the attacks when they happen what i found helped was to not panic  i know that sounds impossible but what i mean is that when your bodys panicking try to remain calm and be aware that this is only a panic attack  tell yourself that and be firm about it  if your thoughts start to wander and you think youre experiencing something physically catastrophic just remember what the doctors said to you  physically youre fine    i know it doesnt make sense at the time cause it feels like youre dying but you can get to a stage where you can keep calm while your body is in panic mode  it takes practice but eventually youll come up with an action plan as to what to do when youre experiencing this  youll get better and better at it until it becomes second nature  remember as well that it will pass    your action plan might be different to other peoples  just find what works for you  keep breathing rhythmically as deeply and for as long as you can  even if it hurts  that will help  consistent breathing is really good because its freeing  try not to move around too much because that might throw your thoughts off balance and make you panic more  you might want to sit forward or lie down  i chose to lie down because theyd last for so long and id end up getting tired  so find a comfortable position perhaps put some music on  you could maybe make an emergency playlist on your phone and id suggest soothing classical music  you might choose to breathe into a bag although i know that doesnt work for me  i become concerned that im only breathing in carbon dioxide which brings about fears of physical catastrophe  that might not be the same for you  but try to avoid anything that feels wrong or knocks your thoughts off balance  you could perhaps light some incense regularly at a time when youre feeling calm perhaps when meditating  get used to the smell of this incense and use it for meditation a good few times and use the same one when youre having a panic attack  your sense of smell is really good for associating with memories and emotions so this might help put you in a calmer mode  and meditating regularly might help ease some of the inner panic youre feeling which might be leading to these panic attacks  check out the headspace app for this  also id suggest white sage incense  hope this eases for you soon really basic but i find this really effective breathe in for two seconds breathe out for 7 repeat  makes you feel a bit lightheaded but its quick and easy works for me sometimes the unknown can make us feel like that  it might just be that you havent started your job yet  i think exercise is a good idea i hope this goes well for you  do you do anything to take your mind off things  maybe reading would be good should be fine i think  if youre worried about this kind of stuff you can store your files on dropbox or something i get that feeling if ive been off work for a little bit  youll be okay i would suggest trying to acclimatising yourself to being around people a little bit each day so it doesnt strike you as too alien and it doesnt stop you from going seeing your friends  going seeing your friends would be really good for you youll get through this  youve made so many positive steps recently  i know its hard to come across a set back but your attitude is so so good right now im sure youll be able to overcome this  just dont let it get too long between trips out and you should be able to beat this im glad youre seeing a specialist about this because itll dispel any fears you may have about it being a physical thing  i think youll feel a hell of a lot better once youre sure what this is and you have some more strategies to deal with it when it happens  its understandable that youd be scared about it because its like a problem you feel youve already solved  but dont worry   i suffer from panic attacks too and i find they come and go  i used to get them almost daily in uni then none at all then a little bit when i was training to be a teacher and then the other morning i woke up having a panic attack and i was like really  im quite good at dealing with them when they happen because they used to happen so so much just dont give into it  dont panic  as hard as that is to do and as easy as it is to say  it hurts like fuck but dont panic and keep breathing and youll find that you can handle them fairly quickly  hope everything goes well for you  in the meantime between now and your appointment is there anyone close to you you could talk to about how anxious youre feeling  that might help i dont think theres any weight to this argument  its like saying love isnt real because its just chemicals in your brain  of course its just chemicals  it doesnt make it feel any less real though  theres no such thing as a selfless act but of course there isnt  doesnt stop you from feeling that you care hello and    im sorry youre struggling with this phobia   in answer to your question im not sure to be honest  im not sure if something like mindfulness would help because that encourages you to be in the now   what about being in the now scares you  is it like an existential crisis im sorry youre going through this  workplace sexual harassment works both ways  youre not there to be gawked at and these women should respect that  im sorry this is making your working life harder than it needs to be hello and    i suggest have him come to a meeting with your gp or therapist so he can hear from them how serious what youre experiencing is  might work if he hears it from someone whos a professional  sometimes people struggle to understand whats going on beneath the surface   might be good for him to see those questionnaires they make you fill out to gauge how depressed you feel eg how often in the past week have you felt worthless etc     hope you find this forum useful and supportive  i know its difficult when your partner doesnt really see what youre going through but hopefully with a bit of education on the subject he can learn to support you in the ways that you need right now i think you need to start thinking about whether this person is the right person for you  if youre talking about your innermost feelings and the pain youre feeling and he had no interest  thats bloody awful i think youre right actually michael  my last post was going a bit far and probably not quite fair to the guy  maybe hes processing it in another way  i sometimes forget how different men are  my apologies  caught me at a bad time i guess i know that feeling  its horrible  its like youre scared of upsetting anyone and you overthink absolutely everything you say   you cant live like that  my advice would be to try to act as authentically as possible with the understanding that youre not going to please everyone and nor should you be expected to because youd never find what you want  do whats right for you and dont feel too bad about not pleasing everyone  thats what im working on  its a long hard process but its so so worth it yeah it really is harder said than done  i dont know how to achieve it really  i think its different for everyone  please dont focus on the negatives about yourself though  im sure there are lots and lots and lots of positives some people just dont know what its like to have mental health issues but those people are often toxic to us  so its not a huge loss  youll find people wholl understand where youre coming from  please dont worry  i know that mustve been quite a saddening experience for you  try to distract yourself by doing something you enjoy its understandable that youd be a debbie downer youre struggling  some people cant really cope with a lot of this stuff  this forum is really good though  im sure your mother isnt exhausted with you  shell just be unsure what to do to help  the best thing you could do right now would be to focus on yourself and try to make yourself feel better i think writing things down is a great idea  its hard to try to summarise all your personal feelings to someone who doesnt know you  maybe your therapist having that background information will mean she will be able to ask more questions that are relevant to you and bring you out of your shell a bit more  dont worry i imagine this is very common in therapy  i think you should also ask yourself if theres anything about your therapist thats making you feel less open sometimes that just happens and it wouldnt be a bad thing if you had to change therapists i have social anxiety too although im coping with it a lot better nowadays and ive had this urge so many times  i think youve got your head screwed on about this though when you say it probably wont solve all of your problems it just seems that way at the time  sometimes you just need a break from your world and thats even harder to do when youre socially anxious maybe what youre feeling is a build up of missed opportunities to breathe away from your normal situation  why dont you go for a hike or something with someone you trust  might make you feel better   wish you all the best hello and welcome to the forum  please dont worry youre just in a transition stage between drugs and that can make you feel temporarily worse  this will pass  im on fluoxetine and it made me worse at the beginning but its really good for me now actually  it just lessens all the really intense feelings of sadness and lets you focus more on things  its quite mellow and comforting  this will pass just keep in close contact with your gppsychiatrist so they can monitor any new developments and decide on the best course of treatment for you  there are better times ahead hello and   i havent had therapy specifically for panic attacks but i used to suffer with them really badly i still do suffer from them still from time to time and ive found that therapy does really help generally  its good to have strategies to know how to deal with it when it happens which lessens your anxiety about it in itself  hope you find something that helps you i know panic attacks are a fucking nightmare but you can get better hello dan and    im so sorry youre struggling with anxiety at the moment  please remember that  although there are a lot of horror stories out there  the appointment should be a good thing for you  i know anxiety can make things seem like everythings doom and gloom and i know its easier said than done but maybe you could try to look forward to it  not to the appointment itself as it sounds like thats a real stressor for you but instead look forward to the feeling of accomplishment and hopefully calm after the appointment if it goes well and makes you feel a bit more in control     i know thats hard to do and i really hope the appointment goes well for you  ive found that if you tell the people there that youre a bit nervous theyre usually quite accommodating for that and will make you feel a bit more at ease  remember its their job to do that   remember youll be feeling a bit nervous about it too because youve been out of the cycle of going outside and things and it can be really hard to get back into all of that but its all in your head   i hope you can find a lovely perfume to wear  just to put your mind at rest  and maybe a hat if itll make you feel better  not that you have to  just might give you a bit of a boost that might make the whole experience a bit more smooth for you   hope it all goes well and thank you for joining the forum  i hope you find it useful  it can be really hard when youre dealing with the anxieties of getting mental health treatment on your own  a lot of conversations here are centred around anxiety in terms of going to appointments so i hope you can share with us how youre feeling as it might show you that youre really not alone when it comes to all of this  also you should never ever suffer in silence aw thats great  my mums like that too  shes like so you owe someone money  what are they gonna do come round here and break your legs  i think not  well just not answer the door  well not answer the fucking door  they can fuck off  hahaha  shes not chavy or anything  im making her sound chavy  shes really sweet and just really on my side   well done for going through that bloody assessment  its done now you should feel so proud of yourself for going and putting yourself through it and by the sounds of it theyll be able to visibly see how much you are suffering which is surely a good thing i love a good swear hey guys  my chest has been in really bad pain all day  its like a constant panic attack but im able to remain calm  but it doesnt take the pain away  its fucking nearly unbearable  i do not know what to do  i know i cant go into work tomorrow  im gonna get a sick note tomorrow  maybe thatll lessen my anxiety  i feel like im broken  every noise is literally painful  trying to breathe  god i dont want to feel like this anymore shit man i wish i had some valium its like a tightening in my chest that is really painful and makes me feel dizzy  im noticing im forgetting to breathe  i had a nap before today and i woke up feeling worse  i will go to bed soon though  thank you im not sure what it is but its just really painful and so long lasting hello and    im so sorry youre experiencing this it must be very difficult to be afraid to sleep  i hope you are getting enough sleep   are you in touch with a gp about this  also you mention you have exams maybe you could talk to the counsellor at your place of study   you might want to consider measures to make yourself feel safer when you go to sleep  maybe look into dreamcatchers  i mean this is the very reason they were created in the first place to protect people from harmful spirits in dreams and certainly its stood the test of time maybe theres something in that you know aw im not sure what this is referring to but it sounds like its really stressful for you and i sincerely hope the torture is over soon  its appalling how these organisations can keep you waiting for far longer than you ever should    wednesday isnt that far away now in the grand scheme of things  try to be kind to yourself in the meantime i dont think you should ring the police  i think you need to take a step back breathe for a while then call a mental health professional  i think youre really struggling right now theres also stuff on the internet about how the worlds economy is ran by lizard people  and lots of urban legends  doesnt mean its true  im sure if it were true wed know a lot more about it   it sounds like maybe youre having night terrors and are harming yourself in your sleep as a result i dont think theres much in the way of evidence to support this  i dont think youre in any immediate danger  i do think you should get in touch with a mh professional asap if you can  im not sure where to direct you to so i feel a bit useless in this area but maybe nhs direct is a good place to start  they might be able to put you in touch with someone you could speak to in your area hello and    im not sure what to suggest really  i think the best thing is to always keep in touch with your gp and see what they suggest  id also suggest having a change in routine every so often to give your mind a break if you can  also have you tried practising mindfulness  that can sometimes help a lot   hope you find this forum useful and supportive im so sorry youre going through this right now  i recently went through a break up and i know what you mean  its so intensely painful and can make you feel so bad about yourself but please remember that it wont be like this forever i know emotionally you probably cant look into the future right now though  youre making such a positive step to see your psychiatrist  please be really really kind to yourself right now and focus on you  now is a brilliant time to do that  you can find yourself again you know   wish you all the best i really do ive talked about this in a describe how you feel in a sentence thread but i dont want to hijack it so i thought id make my own  this is what ive already said  having a really bad day im in work tomorrow i havent gotten everything finished and ive had a run in with my ex whos made me feel like shit again really dont need this right now i dont know if work will be understanding about the work i havent done because i made out like the easter holidays would be a cutoff point where i could make my life better but ive been so depressed and stressed out ive barely done anything dont know if i can handle my nqt year  im having really bad anxiety   thanks everyone for your support and letting me vent thanks so much everyone  my first days at work were okay  havent had the energy to post yet  its always worse in your head i guess  im feeling okay about my ex  i guess his words and actions just go to show i really dont need him in my life as sad and as disappointing as that is    thank you for your concern and support it really means a lot i used to and still do have like a running monologue in my head that takes any opportunity to call me a shit haha  id do things as well like tense up when i was going to be around people my breathing became erratic  mostly it was that  id think too much about where to put my hands too  id grind my teeth a little too  i think if youre more relaxed those things tend to lessen quite a lot anyway so relaxation techniques really help hello and    we accept the love we think we deserve   it sounds like things are going really well in your relationship at the moment and your brains a bastard and is trying to find any way to make you feel like shit or sabotage a good thing  i have a mind like that i know where youre coming from   i would get in touch with your uni counsellor straight away cause shell be able to talk you through these worries and also give you strategies of how to feel more secure within yourself which will cripple the basis of these worries   hope you can push these thoughts out of your mind soon and i wish you and your partner lots of wonderfully happy times together im so sorry youre feeling this way valleygirl  hopefully today will be good for you when you wake up     have you told your gp about your sudden and extreme changes in mood hello and    im sorry youve been experiencing such a rough time  unfortunately i dont think ill be able to answer the question you had about why it happened its probably a multitude of factors that built up and caused a physical reaction in your body  sounds like you were experiencing panic attacks   the best way to avoid those feelings is to take good care of your mental health you should be feeling more secure in that now youre on medication  i would suggest you have some kind of talking therapy in order to identify what triggers these feelings in you and to help you come up with some strategies of how to deal with it when it does happen  once you have that solid basis your anxiety about your anxiety should lessen anyway as a result as youll feel more secure and ready to tackle the thing   this forum is really good as a means of talking or typing ha therapy  its helped me a lot  another good thing is to practice mindfulness and breathing techniques its about focusing your mind on your breathing or the world around you so your mind doesnt become bombarded with other things that can cause you to become anxious or depressed or be feeling out of control   these are things you should practise daily as the idea is to reprogramme your mind with healthier mental habits so you can better prevent any breakdowns   hope that helps  wish you all the best i suffer from anxiety and i was really worried when i had driving lessons i havent passed my test but thats because i never took it other things got in the way so haha   i found that once youre behind the wheel its a different experience  if you have a good driving instructor who is clear and supportive your anxiety will lessen as a result  once you get used to the controls you realise that in actually controlling the car its quite simple once you get your head around it  then when youre learning to drive on different kinds of roads youll have someone talking you through what to do and when  and they wont just make you go on a road youre not comfortable with straight away theyll build you up   when youre learning to drive its not uncommon to have these feelings of anxiety most people who ive talked to who have learned to drive have had dreams where they crash the car   it just shows youre concerned about not getting it wrong which will probably help you when you start learning   hope you can overcome this   god i wish i had a car youll have someone there to prevent you from doing that  and they have a brake on their side so its all good  i know the thing with anxiety is that sometimes its just not logical  hope you feel differently once youre in the car though i think you will i agree i think you should tell a mental health professional how youre feeling and theyll be able to help you make the call  im so sorry this episode is lasting so long for you  sounds like you need help yeah ive been there  abused sexually and then selfmedicating     ridethelightning i didnt struggle with selfmedicating as much as you seem to be right now but it was sometimes quite bad  if you ever need someone to talk to  someone whos been in a similar situation and has mostly come out the other side please pm me hello and welcome to the forum  i know what you mean about anxiety and paranoia at work  i think everyone experiences it to some extent its because its quite a false situation really where youre playing a role and so is everyone else and if you think about it too much it seems like a minefield   but it sounds like youre doing great  also theres things you can do to help you lessen the anxiety if its becoming too much of an issue for you  are you in touch with a therapist  does your work itself have any sort of counselling    are there any colleagues you feel comfortable enough to talk to about how youre feeling  hope you feel better soon wish you the best  remember try not to focus on how youre being perceived if you focus on being mint at your job everyone will love you anyway oh i know that  yeah its really good its about how your amygdela your emotional brain and how when thats activated you cant access your rational thinking  we were looking at it at school for those kids who come from difficult backgrounds   am i right thats really great to hear  being a perfectionist can be an amazing thing but its not a healthy mindset look up growth mindset versus fixed mindset  growth mindset is the idea that progress is always better than perfection it gives you the positivity to always be moving forward  whereas fixed mindset can go one of two ways as i understand it you believe youre really bad at something and therefore you dont try or you believe you should must have to be really good at something and the worry of not being perfect 100 of the time stops you in your tracks  you must learn to recognise that a little bit of failure is often part of the learning process and if youre willing to fail sometimes youll get way further than you ever would by being a perfectionist in the long run i know what you mean  when ive been for teaching interviews ive wanted to throw up  everyone feels the same on them they last all day and youre constantly being watched and scrutinised even though they tell you youre not which is ridiculous and then its almost worse afterwards because youre waiting for a bloody phone call  in teaching they try to ring you the same day  ive had colleagues who for whatever reason where rang a few days afterwards and they were visibly struggling with the anxiety  i dont know how youre coping with it its very stressful  i hope you get your answer soon and ive got my fingers crossed for you god im so sorry they havent called you yet  still wishing you the best im so sorry  drug addiction is a common result of being abused as a child especially sexually  please remember that you are worth it and you can get through this  please talk to a mental health professional asap im sorry youre having a hard time accepting help right now  i remember feeling like that at your age  it was almost like ive got this far without any of your fucking help so i dont need it now either and then finding myself struggling even more and blaming myself because i was the person i was meant to be relying on  i dont know if you feel the same way its different for everyone but it doesnt have to be that you have to deal with this alone  you shouldnt  of course you had trouble telling anyone what happened you had enough trouble dealing with it let alone being the one to bring it out into the open and tell your loved ones  especially because that throws their perceptions of their loved ones in the dirt  its horrible that you should have to be the one to do that especially after everything youve been through  please do not blame yourself  none of this is your fault  and you do deserve help it seems like you need help right now and theres nothing wrong with that  i hope you can start to accept help soon you need to go to the dentist  purely to lessen your anxiety about the whole thing  youll be fine  ive had this before i was scared to go because i didnt take care of them as well as i should and when i went they were understanding and just told me what i needed to have done  you might have to have some treatment but its better than waiting and losing a tooth  you do not want to have root canal treatment  it is a bastard   when i get like that i often have dreams about breaking or losing my teeth   best thing to do is just bite the bullet ha and go  if youre worried about their reaction just open up a bit and apologise for not coming sooner and tell them how worried you are your teeth might not be in the best state theyll probably be very understanding ahh i see what you mean  hopefully once your dentist tells you youre all clear youll feel better  if not then are you in touch with any therapists  if you cant lessen the anxiety fully through physical measures then id go down that road  hope this doesnt trouble you for much longer i know its hard when it feels like nothings helping but youve got to keep going with that kind of stuff you cant as you say just deal with it on your own  as hard as it is you should keep pursuing different kinds of therapy until something works  people dont understand this shit ive had friends who are like get over it  frankly ive cut them out of my life  they werent helpful at all  im not saying you should do that  its not anyones fault they dont understand because they havent been through this  but dont expect yourself to be able to just shake it off and be okay  its too much to handle  im really glad you feel better today and i hope it continues i know that feeling  you can learn to manage this  dont worry  youre only young this will get better  youre right about the fact you shouldnt bottle it up because thats half the problem you need to deal with it rather than push it away because it creates tension that you cant control  i feel for you    also dont be too hard on yourself  youre not a burden youre struggling and its understandable as to why  i can understand the frustration of not being able to tell anyone but being really in a low place  it comes out  but it doesnt mean youre not worth it hey im sorry youre going through this  you dont sound nuts it sounds like youre suffering right now  panic attacks are awful especially when youre not getting the support you need from a loved one which makes you panic more  i hope youre feeling better now and have managed to get some sleep   i know it seems bad right now and you dont want this sort of thing to be happening all the time for both of your sakes  but you and your partner can move from this forward together  this can be sorted out       i think she needs to understand a bit more how her actions are affecting you and modify her behaviour accordingly and you need strategies to deal with the panic attacks when they come a bit of a compromise really   i suffer from panic attacks and my key piece of advice would be dont give into them dont panic  i try to ignore the pain in my chest and try to breathe and they tend to be over fairly quickly     thats really hard to do when youre anxious over a partner though  in that respect i would try to remind yourself that your partner loves you and that everything is okay in that department your partner should help you with this recognise that youre having a panic attack and therefore your thoughts should be taken with a pinch of salt and also you should try to distract yourself with something positive maybe a comedy show   its all much easier said than done though i know    have you seen a doctor about this    wish you all the best im not on the drugs youre on but i get that kind of stuff sometimes i find myself whispering help me when i feel really agitated or saying it over and over again in a whisper and i think what the actual fuck  i wouldnt worry  it sounds as though youre just feeling very agitated at the moment and youre having some unfamiliar sideeffects from the new drugs youre on  try to keep a log of when you feel particularly agitated so then maybe you can recognise whats triggering you and keep in close contact with your gp ohhh i see what you mean now  sorry  yeah i can understand why that would be confusing and disorientating  im sorry your doctor is not being as understanding as he could be  whatever the diagnosis it does sound as though hes taking your symptoms seriously by agreeing to reduce your medication i doubt a medical professional would be motivated by wanting to humour someone when it comes to giving them medication  hope it starts getting better for you soon youre not stupid they should have rang you by now  id say something like i understood that your decision was going to be made a few days ago and im just checking in on the progress of that decision as i have not yet been contacted  you deserve to know im sorry to ask you mustve said but i missed it what is sues job to you  youll be okay  may isnt for a while yet and well be here to support you  plus youll know about this job very soon and youll feel better about everything then im so sorry youre going through this anxiety is horrible  could you not go to the doctors for a checkup  that way its completely out of your mind and your doctor will hopefully give you something for the anxiety youre feeling too  they might be able to prescribe something or put you in touch with some support groups ive done this a lot  i suffered abuse as a child  i think its fairly normal and you shouldnt feel guilty about it  i know its hard but try not to look for love in this way for your own sake  because the more you affirm the idea that youre childlike and need to be looked after particularly with manipulation the further you are away from a full recovery  thats easier said than done though its hard to flick a switch and say i will now endeavour to be emotionally selfreliant because incredibly hard when you have low selfesteem and you probably feel very guilty for not being completely selfreliant already anyway i do almost constantly    there is a happy middle ground in the future though  where you feel like you can act authentically and independently where it matters but you can also count on other people because thats not a bad thing and everyone needs that  sorry to hear youre struggling like this  if you want someone to show you that they care its probably best to just be open about it i dont think people like to be deceived  hopefully you have people around you around whom you feel as though you can be properly honest ahh i know how you feel  its horrible when youre anxious because it feels as though thats all there is  especially if you suffer from longterm anxiety  you can learn to manage it though and it doesnt have to be forever  thats what i keep telling myself  how often do you feel anxious   sorry youre going through this  hope you have some relief soon im so sorry to hear you had a breakdown  dont worry it happens to a lot of people  i had to leave a job last year because i had a breakdown and ive had pretty rough childhood with abuse and stuff  i was off for a few months and then got a job again  youll get back on your feet    it sounds like you need to deal with whats hurting you from your childhood before you can move on  if i were you id just focus on your wellbeing then everything else will follow  has the therapy been helping  are there people you can spend time with dont suffer in silence  i know its hard to admit youre struggling but oh my days its so much harder to maintain the im fine persona when youre not fine  its fine to admit youre not okay  if you dont feel as though you can tell anyone in your life  which i totally understand  tell me  pm me if you like  it sounds as if we have a fair bit in common    i tend to moan like a bastard though  to be fair only in certain circumstances  i had to tell the people at work ive been going through a rough time recently and they were horrified i was suffering in silence for so long so i guess im a bit like you in a way  let it out when you feel able youll feel better  theres no reason to be ashamed of how youre feeling or what happened  thats just insult to injury im so sorry jimmy  breakups are a terrible shock to the system   theres no other situation like it in most peoples lives  one day you have a loving partner whose life you share and the next everything changes theyre not there anymore and you have to weigh up everything in your life differently  and that person is different towards you  its like a death in that respect  and like the grounds been pulled from underneath you  i bet youre not eating sleeping cant concentrate always tearful and your body is like why is this happening  my colleagues going through this at the moment she drives me into work and shes in fucking pieces every minute of the day  it hurts so so so much for a while but it will get better  you will get through this  people do  i know that thought is totally alien to you at the moment and the last thing you want to happen but i hope you can find some solace in the fact that this pain is not forever  please surround yourself with understanding people dont allow yourself to focus on it too much  obviously let yourself feel the pain because you need to process it and get over it  but you must be kind to yourself  your body and your mind are going through a terrible trauma    the best thing you can do to allow yourself to heal is break it off you must think i cant do this to myself anymore i have to draw a line in the sand and then do it  you cannot be constantly going back and forth in your mind wanting to work things out because youll never allow yourself to heal  it doesnt sound like youre ready to do that yet and that is okay  its completely understandable  but one day you will and thats when youll start to get better because youll take some level of ownership over whats happening  until then be very very kind to yourself  do whatever you need to do to help yourself get to that break off point for yourself  if you need to talk to her again to finalise this and get a sense of closure do it  maybe it wont be the end  but at least youll know and you can move on from this no matter what the outcome  you cant live in this state for very long  i hope i havent upset you and i hope you feel better very very soon  focus on making new memories i think its important to focus on the positives and the fact that youre dealing with your anxiety a lot better than you have done in the past  youre also at uni doing sports and have a parttime job  thats really difficult for someone who suffers with anxiety and you should give yourself real credit for that  i used to have similar thoughts when i was in uni i remember doing to a counselor and saying to him something like i dont know how to walk down the street  where do i look  where do i put my arms  everything i do seems wrong  i think uni is a really difficult time for anyone because youre basically forging your adult self and thats bloody hard to do  but the best piece of advice or comment really that someone gave me was that i was so scared of being the wrong thing that i wasnt letting myself be anything  i know its piss easy for me to say and its not like you can wave a magic wand and make it happen but i think your end goal should be to get into a mindset where youre not bothered about being a certain way  you might look like a dick to some people  some people wont like you  but you cant please everyone and trying to please everyone or not offend anyone or trying to stay unnoticed is just making you ill  it would make anyone ill  plus youll attract the right kind of company for you if you feel like you can be yourself  id suggest seeking counselling in uni youre so lucky in that respect  its free and really quick to access  then id try to build some deeper relationships by asking people to hang out with you when you feel a bit more comfortable doing that not easy i know because hopefully thatll give you a deeper sense of meaning and enjoyment in your life  im trying not to give advice which is as useless as basically hey  dont be anxious and i dont know if im succeeding but i really hope you start feeling more comfortable in yourself soon  ps dont judge your looks too harshly when you know youre feeling shitty anyway itll be affecting your judgement im sorry you have such bad anxiety but im glad youre not having to put yourself through a life of stress at work  thanks for your kind words thanks so much for your kind words everyone  in moments like that i wonder whether i can cope  it went okay in the end though sounds like youre having a bit of an existential crisis which is perfectly normal when youre studying philosophy  i took philosophy for a level and it also comprised half of my degree i took philosophy  linguistics  my mum always said those courses fucked me up mentally and i do know what you mean  i remember coming out of as classes thinking that the whole world had changed forever  ive always been fascinated the limits of perception and the meaning of it all  your heads full of questions about the world and it always will be  you might find some answers to these questions but theyll be your answers and youll have no real way of knowing whether youre right because there seems to be a massive problem with being able to ever view things objectively  but thats fine  thats life i disagree with that  it has limitations because as soon as a question is properly answered them its no longer considered philosophy in many ways  but its hardly a dead end in the sense that we have questions about the world that we are not able to answer and these questions only lead to further questions  its a giant web that keeps growing the more we know thats true sorry i dont have time to view your video at the moment but i will have a peruse when i get a chance as i say once a question is answered its no longer philosophy  that doesnt mean that philosophy is a dead end though because its the birthplace of enquiry and it deals with probably the most important stuff there is  its where the important questions are first formed i know the definition of philosophy    well  the dictionary definition anyway  the actual meaning of it is often contested  but yes its a really common symptom of anxiety sometimes i dont even realise im breathing shallowly and then i realise all of a sudden and i feel breathless and even more panicked  have you tried breathing in for 2 seconds and breathing out for 7 or as long as you can  it apparently slows your heart rate really effectively  hope youre feeling okay today hi maw10  welcome to the forum   its a difficult question to answer because i dont know the answer myself i suffer from depression and anxiety and it has really put a strain on relationships in the past  im sorry to hear youre struggling at the moment   by incident with her ex do you mean that she cheated on you with her ex  because if so thats a completely understandable basis for your feelings of anxiety and thats something she should be helping you get over by actively rebuilding your trust in her   my advice generally with depression and anxiety is keep on with the medication its great youre on something  i hope its working for you keep in close contact with your gp to monitor any changes in your mood and maybe get some kind of talking therapy  im sure you know this already   its hard to do so when youre depressed but you should also find a way to focus on the positives in your life and take some time out to work on you  be it reading exercising or whatever it is that relieves your stress   hope you can get to sleep soon sometimes when i think of something really cringeworthy i basically twitch  i do a sharp intake of breath and my jaw clenches its really quick and involuntary  its so fucking embarrassing  i usually do it when im tired mostly at the end of the day when i routinely run through all the stupid shit ive said and done  there have been times though where ive been really tired and have nearly done it at work  i really need to be so conscious of it   i only started doing it a few years ago after quite a long stint of drug abuse about a year on unresearched untested technically legal drugs  wondering if anyones experienced a similar thing and whether theres anything i can do it alleviateprevent it   ill bring it up with my cbt therapist when i finally get an appointment  this is the first time ive really opened up a conversation about it outside my relationship because its so embarrassing i like to think its not so bad but its pretty noticeable my boyfriend and housemates have been a bit confused by it asked if im okay and stuff  its more when i think of something cringeworthy so it usually happens without any sort of external stimulus  im just sort of hoping noone notices  thanks for your kind words i struggle with this too  they say that people who suffer from anxiety often have problems being assertive  remember you dont have to yell youre probably going to make yourself feel worse by doing so as well haha and you can be assertive by just stating what it is you want in a positive way  ive made a bit of headway in this area ive found that being able to say no to things helps me to feel more in control and therefore more assertive  im sorry that people are talking down to you thats horrible and its difficult for anyone to deal with  remember that you can be assertive by just removing yourself from the situation  it shows that youre putting yourself first  and no you absolutely should not feel bad about standing up for yourself im sorry to hear youre going through this right now   it sounds like it is passing though which is good  you have reached out to us which is even better  i think you need to be with someone right now or at least talk to someone  is there anyone you know who you can be with at the moment  can you ring a suicide charity number    also please go to ae if youre still feeling wobbly   dont worry you can get through this i agree bluegrass  mami5 it is better not to hide this  the more they know the better they can help you  hope you are feeling better i think you should definitely talk to a professional so that you can identify what it is you are feeling as not knowing may be causing more anxiety about it  remember that panic attack or not there are things you can do to prevent these feelings from happening and it sounds like you have the support to help you achieve this thats understandable  the world will probably seem a hell of a lot more dangerous to you now especially since you dont have the answers yet about what happened  please talk to someone about this it might be best to talk to a professional about these fears because you dont want those fears to fester and to stop you from enjoying your life  good luck at the funeral  i hope it gives you a sense of closure  ask people for support if necessary im sure youll be able to sort something out  it sounds like you need some time out of work if possible to focus on yourself  are you currently receiving any therapy    it may be hard for you but i think it would be really good if you opened up to your friends at work and just explain that what happened was a culmination of many things that were out of your control and that you are now going to take steps to fix these  even if youre not sure what they are yet  just remember youre not a bad person and you can get through this  best of luck i can really empathise with your feeling of being out of control and wanting to erase the past  i guess the standard advice would be to identify what it is that makes you feel like this first of all  do you feel youve made any headway in this area from past therapycounselling i cant imagine what youre going through  one of my housemates has recently lost his mum and i feel equally unable to give advice   i know that people often feel the need to know answers when someone has been untimely taken from them because it gives them a sense of closure  unfortunately this truth may take a long time to come to light  what i would suggest is to find some sense of personal closure for your loss   my housemate wrote a letter to his mum and then burned it he said it helped him because it helped him get all of his feelings out and because his mother was cremated he perceived a connection between the letter and his mum  it doesnt even have to make sense to anyone else it can just be personal to you and your friend and still be powerful and significant  my advice would be try and do something cleansing if you can while you wait for answers   i assume the funeral is soon this can be your starting point for closure also   im sorry you have to go through so much pain  take the support of the people around you give support  pm me any time hi   this sounds like a mental health issue to me although obviously im not a professional  have you spoken to your gp about this  they might be able to define this and give you some help   i really hope you can find some help and resist the urge to become homeless  it might seem better than what you have now due to your anxiety about your life at the moment but it cant truly be better than what you have now  youll be cold lonely hungry ignored and in serious danger  dont let it get to that point  httpwwwchannel4comnewsleehalinvestigation   thinking of you do you mean the kind of meeting situations where everyone has to introduce themselves onebyone  if so i find this very anxietyinducing too in fact i hate it  i think its the act of waiting for your turn listening to what other people are saying and not wanting to be the one to mess it up  if im on the right lines just try to remember that everyone there is in the same boat thats understandable  your evaluation of the situation sounds right when youre doing your own presentation you feel in control whereas when youre asked out of the blue to introduce yourself youre suddenly out of control and on the spot    i dont know how helpful this is because i find this situation very stressful too  i tend to practise what im going to say in my head beforehand  this is only really possible if youre not one of the first people to be put on the spot  usually its about three things you need to say isnt it  im name  im here because thing and perhaps even the dreaded something unique about me is  i try to get those things together say them as clearly as possible and then turn to the next person to indicate my turn is finished haha  you might want to build on something someone else has said as well to make yourself feel more at ease  like such a person im also or something\n",

      "doc: im not familiar with drugs or whether they can have lasting effects like youre having but it does sound like youre experiencing anxiety   i would talk to a doctor if i were you 7080 of your day is a lot of time to be feeling this way and they might be able to help you   i dont know how youd feel about taking medication but there are meds that can help and there might also be talking therapies on offer some areas also do short courses in cbt or other therapy skills so it gives you a tool to use against the anxiety restless legs are something i deal with and i know its because of my social anxiety having all that flight or fight energy with no real outlet just leads to legs spontaneously moving to release it  its odd i have a very clicky neck too  but my posture is awful from where ive walked around with my head down avoiding eye contact and having to deal with facing people its left me with a slight curve around my shoulders im wondering if perhaps it could the the same thing with you   dont underestimate what mental health can do to your physical wellbeing its amazing how it can effect you hello i see this post is from several weeks ago so im not sure if youre still checking in on the forum  im sorry you didnt get a reply sooner    i think youre being too hard on yourself about this situation   its understandable that you might feel guilty to some degree but you mustnt torment yourself with it   you are looking back on a situation with hindsight and at the time you didnt know better you didnt have the information about marriage after 30 back then    you probably dont keep in contact with this woman but you dont know her circumstances now she might be very happy and here you are feeling really awful for no good reason   i know it must be difficult but its essential that you forgive yourself hiya i see this post is from a few days ago sorry youve not had a response yet   i can understand why youd be feeling anxious at an increase in medication  its always trial and error to get to the right dosage and you have to weigh up the pros and cons in your mind as to whether its advantageous to increase a dose    do you think that having seen how much 10mg has helped increasing the dose might help you more  or are you happy to continue with where youre at  also im wondering if youve been offered any kind of therapy alongside your medication its all very well taking meds but usually it takes more to really start making progress   im sorry to hear of your selfesteem issues unfortunately most medication of mental health has weight gain as a side effect   again you have to take into consideration the benefits that the medication brings you   personally im classed as severely obese but without the medication im on id be suicidal if its literally saving my life then sod it my weight can just be as it is    do you know what size you are at the moment i had a phase where i just had to accept what i was it may just be a number but the implications can make you feel pretty crappy  what helped me is really valuing myself and thinking actually i deserve to wear clothes that are comfortable and if that means buying a certain size then so be it    if high street shops dont stock your size they dont stock mine then online shopping can be good if you dont have a big budget ebay is pretty good for getting a bargain  you really are doing the best you can and fighting through some difficult issues and as i said you deserve to be comfortable    i think that when you dont feel good about yourself its easy to stop caring about yourself but feeling low is all the more reason to make the most of yourself misskitty has given you some great advice which i cant really add too  so really i just wanted to say that i hear you and know exactly how you feel when i was 16 i was so awful and like you i got my mum to basically speak for me but im 23 next week and can tell you that ive definitely got much better i live on my own now so i have to be able to answer the phone and be the responsible one who does the shopping etc restaurants are a whole different ball game though i know eating and ordering food is a big issue for me and a lot of people who have social anxiety  one thing i have found helpful is to always have a bottle of water on me when im really nervous i sip at it its good because its obviously a healthy habit but it also keeps you present in your body you obviously cant breathe really fast and drink at the same time so it helps calm my breathing and finally if youve got a mouthful of water the silences dont feel so bad because nobody expects you to speak while youve got your mouth full hey lu havent spoken to you here on the forum for a while    i know its really difficult not to worry especially when you have the association in your mind of what happened with your mum in my opinion its probably natural that this might make you feel scared   please dont blame yourself just because youve had it if anything try to take reassurance from the fact that you had it but youre better now   if its any consolation ive been struggling with this to i do have irritable bowel syndrome and for some reason really cold or really hot weather can trigger it also even if you enjoy christmas its still stressful and our bodies can react to that by eliminating waste quicker than normal sounds like what youre experiencing is having quite a big effect on your life at the moment    medication is a double edged sword because it can help but it seems with all medication theres a trade of sorts where one thing gets better but at a cost  the weird side effects  i suppose you have to try and evaluate whether or not any positive effects the medication is having outweighs the negatives  i do think that the effectiveness of medication depends on the length of time youve taken it and at what dose among many other things  it really is your decision what you do  i cant really tell you what to do because only you know whats best    that dream state sounds like derealisation to me its something ive dealt with for a long time and it can be really horrible and at times frightening unfortunately its one of those things that gets worse the more anxious you are and theres no treatment for it other than to be less anxious    as for the driving lessons is the anxiety about driving itself or more of a social anxiety related to being in a car with an instructor  i found driving lessons hard due to social anxiety and not wanting to be in a confined space like a car with a stranger   do you practice with someone you know in the car with you at all   i think you have to do these things when the time is right for you if you give it a rest for a while until things improve dont be too hard on yourself about it   on the other hand you dont want the anxiety to win and stop you from achieving something  even if it is scary you can be successful has maddie got any underlying illness  its not cheap to go to a vet but that might be an option if youre really worried  i think animals are very intuitive and it may be that shes picking up on your anxiety and so is behaving weird because she can tell youre worried if its bad you can feed her on plain rice for a few days but itll clear itself up im sure she might have eaten or licked something outside that wasnt very good for her while i agree it wont address the root of the problem i think meditation could be beneficial if you practise it regularly it might reduce your overall stress levels  also depending on the type of meditation it could help you when things are bad say if you do a breathing meditation breath in to the count of four hold to the count of four exhale to the count of four the next time you feel overwhelmed it may help to do that also mindfulness meditation is good if you practise mindfulness you will be more aware of your thoughts and your thought patterns and so have better insight into what leads up to you feeling anxious oh and as for emdr i really dont know enough about it to say if it would be helpful or if you could do it yourself definitely agree with what others are saying about how people can pick up on our own uneasiness and then start to feel awkward around us as a result centurion when you asked how do i make it go away what did you mean the anxiety itself or the thoughts you have around the anxiety i can tell by your post youre thinking a lot which is what anxious people do so well in my experience and id like to see if i could give some advice  but im a bit confused sorry it does sound like youve got social anxiety as opposed to general anxiety but im not an expert and sometimes general can lead to social and vice versa  i totally get what you mean about fightingworrying about the anxiety i think if youre putting yourself under pressure to be talkative and sociable youre more likely to freeze up  are you getting any medicalpsych treatment for your social anxiety at the moment   personally i have found an ssri to be useful ive not suddenly started wanting to give lectures to hundreds of people but its silenced the innercritic enough for me to have some breathing space  do you find there are situations that youre better in than others   for me im most comfortable in a group of about 5 people anything bigger makes me anxious but i hate oneonones with someone im not familiar with also i prefer it when im doing something practical with others watching a film craft bowling etc because if the conversation stops its not awkward  find the situations you feel more relaxed in and do more of whatever that is  the more positive experiences you have of not being so anxious or making a fool of yourselfupsetting peoplewhatever you fear doing the better it can be helpful to have a bank of good evidence that you can draw upon whenever the anxiety kicks in i know this thread is a few days old but just thought id say that something ive found very helpful is the reassurance that its unlikely ill faint when i get lightheaded too my psychiatrist explained to me that when youre anxious your body is doing the opposite of what it would if it was about to faint fainting is caused by a drop in blood pressure whereas anxiety causes a raise in blood pressure and heart rate its been good for me to remind myself of that maybe it might be useful for you too its a positive affirmation you can make to yourself like melonheadgirl said also i agree that while ive been shy for as long as i can remember my anxiety was definitely learned i hope things get a bit easier for you anxiety is so unpleasant and can have such a big effect on your life thats a really good question which to be honest i didnt think to ask  i could speculate about how perhaps hyperventilating disturbs oxygencarbon dioxide balance but seeing as i dont even have a gcse in science id probably be making a fool of myself personally i find it can only really help with a specific anxiety that you can do something about  say for instance im worried that someone in my family may be hurt i can phone them and talk to them which reassures me   that generalised sense of anxiety where theres nothing you can put a finger on i havent found cbt to be that helpful because for me cbt boils down to distracting yourself which is hard to do if youve got physical symptoms of anxiety all the time   this is only my opinion however if you have the opportunity to do it and its not going to cost a fortune it might be worth exploring   if not a cbt based selfhelp book might be good just for you to get a sense of what its about  ive got the cbt workbook for dummies ive not read it covertocover but its good to dip in and out of   i hope you manage to get some sort of relief soon whether thats through therapy or medication or whatever i agree with weeman  it would be a good idea to speak to a professional   in answer to your question about whether or not your too anxious it all depends on the amount of impact the anxiety youre experiencing is having on your life and general wellbeing   it sounds to me like its bad enough that youre daytoday living is being affected would you agree   there are lots of different types of anxiety that come within the anxiety umbrella and they can and often do crossover  im waffling a bit now but basically i would suggest you speak to someone  ideally a doctor who would be able to decide where you can go for some support i agree with parayana please try to resist hurting yourself if you can    insomnia is awful but its even worse when you know youve got an early start    i know its so difficult when youre so frustrated but try to relax yourself because they say the more you get wound up the less likely you are to sleep   hope you manage to get some rest soon do you feel like the medication is working well enough for you besides from the issues you are getting with foods  i have had similar experiences with foods for some reason apples can have that effect on me too  i think when your blood sugar gets low you can get very shaky and nauseous it mimics an anxiety attack very well i think it feels so similar that the brain gets confused and so you become more panicky  have you kept a food diary to see what is triggering this response do you eat enough and at regular intervals   it might be worth seeing a doctor just to rule out a physical cause for what youre experiencing it may be a food intolerance or your blood sugars might not be stable hey cottoncandy  just out of interest are you based in the uk   i think a lot of mental health professionals here will basically say youre fine just to get you off of their caseload    im not sure if its part of their training to be told to be provocative and antagonising   i dont know if they think that by being useless youll freak out and thatll be some kind of break through   even if its not the case i do think they play mind games which i cant deal with id much rather complete honesty   ive come across one therapist who i dont think should be practising at all she was absolutely atrocious luckily i had enough selfesteem to see it for the rubbish that it was and stopped attending the sessions   another therapist completely ignored and undermined me when i was telling her about the abuse i was experiencing at home  for the first time in my life i tried to talk about being raped and what the person did to me her response was that some people enjoy that   please do not question your own judgement if your therapist is making you feel undermined and not listened to its not you  its them this probably isnt very helpful but i did experience something similar taking citalopram i carried on taking it and still do now because slowed cognitive type thinking is preferable to crippling anxiety and feeling suicidal  i think there are side effects with all medications sometimes the pros outweigh the cons and life is more tolerable on medication welcome to the forum   i understand where youre coming from im very anxious and very lonely    this forum does help me a lot because i dont  have much if any social contact offline   if youre feeling up to it do post here on the forum because there are plenty of people who understand how you feel   the chillout section is great for general chat hi gingercat and welcome to the forum    im wondering  when youre going about your daytoday life do you really feel your anxiety or would you say you are on more of an autopilot kind of mode   the only reason i ask is that some people are so anxious that their brain zones out to the point of dissociationderealisation and that defence mechanism is a protective thing  and it allows people to seem quite functioning when actually theyre really suffering   if that does fit its ok i just wanted to check in and see   as you say its not easy to really get much benefit from cbt if you dont really have any clear thought patterns that are leading you to be anxious   have you had an overall health check it might be an idea to rule out anything physical that can cause people to feel like this i know having an underoveractive thyroid can affect peoples mental health   also have you talked to a doctor about this at all  if its something youd consider and it felt right for you there are medications that might help too hi runaway welcome to the forum    just want to say i can relate to the tormenting and obsessive kind of thoughts  ive experienced that too and also with a guy that was totally unsuited in fact id say he was toxic to me   as painful and frustrating as it is im pretty sure youre going to get answers from this guy  i know its upsetting and you feel like you need help in order to process whats happened but i think that any further attempts at communicating with him will only leave you more confused and hurt   for whatever reason he is unable to communicate and is stuck in his patterns   you know this  youve said yourself he seemed incapable of empathy or selfexpression   i think now is the time to draw a line in the sand and accept that he has a huge amount of issues that hes not looking at  dont take any of his negativity on board or punish yourself for whats happened   we all do things against our intuition because were not ready to learn a lesson   i know that when i was fixated on toxic guy i let him get away with abusing me   there was something inside of me that knew what was happening all along but wasnt prepared to accept it   i spent time looking inward at what it was i was wanting from him and how i could give that to myself   i also understood that id met him at a time when i was vulnerable and he was a really convenient distraction from all of the shit going on in my family dynamic  i was desperate to break free from the family stuff that was weighing me down and on some level i think i was counting on him as being my ticket away from all the pain and grief that i was feeling about my family   so   im also wondering if its possible for you to look for a job elsewhere   i know you shouldnt have to change your job for the sake of one asshole but its going to be hard to move on if hes there   he sounds very clever at manipulation  hell give you enough affection to keep you hanging on when he senses youre done but will ignore you the rest of the time  its controlling and not easy to ignore   i also wonder if youve got access to any counselling or therapy  the things in your past are probably influencing you really strongly and not for the right reasons with a bit of support you could start to untangle the mess and start to feel more empowered ah i apologise  i wasnt sure where youre from  being from the uk i assumed you might be able to get counselling on the nhs   have you read up on the idea of selfcare  theres a lot of material out there and it can be really nice to explore little daytoday rituals that you can do just to honour yourself  even if its just a fancy bubble bath or a really nice hot drink   not sure if journalling is something youve tried either  one book that helped me is the creative journal the art of finding yourself its not a traditional dear diary type of book its a lot more than that and some days it encourages you to draw how you feel rather than write theres other activities like mapping your time drawing your ideal self writing down your positive traits etc that can be really helpful   basically i recommend doing anything that encourages selfesteem and treasuring yourself even if it feels really alien at first   it can have a knockon effect and help you in putting up boundaries so people like him cant get in hiya welcome to the forum  im really sorry to hear youre in this dilemma    depression and anxiety can go hand in hand and it can create a vicious cycle just like youre experiencing  its clear that this is really affecting your life   im not a doctor but ive been diagnosed with having gad it is basically that feeling you describe of having panic and anxiety for no obvious reason   for me i get anxiety about everything and nothing    i dont want to pressure you at all but i have to say that citalopram has been one thing thats helped me massively   its prescribed for both depression and anxiety so it can reduce both   it can make you feel a bit weird for the first week or two i noticed my eyesight felt a bit wonky nothing that wearing my glasses more often couldnt fix though but it does settle down   is there any particular thing youre worried about when it comes to taking it its tricky when you know you are prone to paranoid thoughts because it can mean its hard to fully trust your own judgement   you sound like you are an intuitive person though and so id say that if youre picking up on a bad vibe from someone theres usually something in it   sometimes people pick up on when someones an empath and will try to hook you in and drain you  have you heard of the term psychic vampire   how are your boundaries in general do you feel youre able to assert yourself and say no when needed  it can feel very weird not to get drawn into something when its so natural to you to be caring but its important not to take on board other peoples stuff   do you do much in terms of visualising a protective bubble or light around you  having the intention set that you are protected can be quite powerful as can visualising any unhealthy attachments and cords falling away   im someone that doesnt go out a lot really i dont have a social life yet i find myself  confronted by people who seem out to get me a lot  i know its because they think they can take advantage of me because im really empathic  but its important not to let those experiences completely cloud my vision  there are other people out there who are similar to me and are kind compassionate people   also try not to take things too personally  people will pick on anybody who they see as being vulnerable if you werent there theyd find someone else  i used to thing something was wrong with me if so many people were picking on me but i have come to realise theyre barely seeing me for who i am at all they just see a target ergh sorry youve having to deal with their ignorance as well as your own mental health issues    some people find it very difficult to accept that mental health problems are real   if youre talking about inlaws im guessing theyre of an older generation where these things werent talked about    having said that its not just older people ive had younger people not accept mental health issues and its incredibly frustrating   it can feel like theyre basically saying they know better than you do about your own mind    have you printed out any fact sheets on your mental health conditions i think websites for mind or rethink have them and suggested they read it do you think thats something theyd be open to doing it would be really nice to be offered some of these treatments but because i pay for a private counsellor because i cant talk to anybody at the cmht im not allowed  maybe ill have to dig out my old cbt for dummies workbook thats if i havent already chucked it out when ive been suicidal in the past depends on what type of tablets there are several different types that they use for anxiety  at the moment i take an ssri antidepressant  citalopram while medication can only do so much personally citalopram has been one of the best things for me to help with anxiety i do still get anxious thoughts around what ifs but in terms of social anxiety and physical symptoms it helps me a lot and i know id be very different without it  im also prescribed lorazepam a benzodiazepineto take only when things are very bad and im not coping to be honest it makes me very drowsy and sends me to sleep and im aware that the day after taking it my mood can get low and i become more tearful its good in the sense that it can give you some rest but its worth noting that it can sometimes make you feel worse in other ways  i know there are other meds like betablockers and pregablin but i dont have experience of taking those not sure if youve come across a symptom of panic attack being an impending sense of doom but it sounds similar to what you are describing   i do think panic attacks can have a scale but in my opinion and experience there are also different sorts  some attacks are very physical think nhs website while others can be more mental and thoughtbased with fewer physical symptoms   for me ive got several sorts ranging from something bad is going to happen and i want to frantically phone everybody to check theyre ok hands are shaking i feel sick i want to cry right through to ive got to get out of here now i want to scream really loud and shove people hard in the face run outside to get some fresh air because i cant fucking breathe   the joy of anxiety i cant really add much else to what sarahd has said really   but i do just want to reply and send some hugs because it sounds like your anxiety is really putting you through the wringer at the moment    if the betablockers are making things worse i would suggest going back to your doctor because there might be something else that you can try that might be better suited to you they might try a benzodiazepine or something like that   i really hope things start to improve for you soon anyway i suppose what theyre saying about totting up a score for one particular year isnt really the main thing i take from this article  i think just seeing potential stressors written out is helpful reminder for me to understand why my anxiety has varied over time   i am surprised to see christmas so low down in the list though im already anxious about it hi beth and welcome to the forum  nobody here is a professional so we cant diagnose you with anything but i did wonder if perhaps you may be showing signs that are like ocd though of course sometimes a label is just a label  it sounds like anxiety is really causing you problems  im sure you might know that a lot of physical health issues can be caused by anxiety so its easy to get into a vicious circle  anyway i think that because its really starting to affect your life badly you should make an appointment to see your gp and discuss whats going on for you  they should be able to recommend a way forward for you it does sound like youre suffering with anxiety and possibly social anxiety   whilst i still get anxiety i think ive come on a long way with my social anxiety and so i suppose i just want to encourage you to get all of the help you can because it is possible for things to get better   ultimately the best thing you can do is expose yourself to your fear by going out and trying new activities that would involve meeting people  i found that there were less scary things to do than others   for instance going to a meditation group where the aim is relaxation closing your eyes and not talking to people was a really good place for me to start if youd have asked me to go shopping in a busy town centre at the weekend theres no way i would have done it  so maybe try to think about what activities you could do  when youre ready to push yourself in the future thats interesting to note i think ensuring that our levels of all vitamins and minerals is something that can affect physical and mental health positively i do wonder if its possible that too much copper could causes issues the only reason i ask is if somebody does suspect a deficiency could it be a bad idea to take supplements without a doctor recommending it hey catnut welcome to the forum  have you heard anything since writing your letter  i was going to suggest that you write a letter to put your version of events forward but im glad thats something youve already done i really hope the councilstrata are understanding   do you have a contact number for anybody there not sure how you would feel about making a phone call to ask if your letter has been received and if there are any updates to the case   it might be nerveracking to call them but would it be worse than waiting and fearing every day   also have you tried asking the children to be quiet or speaking to their mother i can understand if thats a bit of a nono since she complained about you but its just a thought  i dont think its unreasonable to ask for children not to scream or be too noisy but im guessing if the mother hasnt taught her children manners yet its unlikely she will   i think what your doing with earphones is a good idea by the way any little thing you can do that helps is good   im sorry to hear there doesnt seem to be much support for anxiety in your area  do you have access to transport i wonder if there is something a bit further that you might be able go to i really hope the professional help comes along sooner rather than later  it sounds like youre really struggling and are suffering with some quite severe symptoms  are you ukbased spooks the reason i ask is that i think it would be a really good idea to have regular contact with a gp whilst youre waiting for the professional help to be arranged  it may be that you need medication  not just for mental health but there are certain medications that can help physically such as betablockers if youre having bad symptoms with the anxiety   i know that medication isnt really a cure and is more something to help manage symptoms than it is to address the root of it all but it might be something to consider you can come here to rant  dont apologise or anything like that  youre free to come and go and post as you please   im glad that meds and counselling seem to be going well for you are you discussing the child abuse at counselling just wondering if thats whats bringing all of this back up for you or are there other things going on that you are finding triggering i guess its very difficult given the fact that these sorts of subjects seem to be in the news a lot of the time   its really difficult when youve experienced trauma to get it out of your head  i know that one  aside from the counselling are you seeing a doctor at all it might be a good idea to make them aware of whats going on  whilst you say that youre not at that point of wanting to take your own life yet if that ever changes you must talk to your doctor right away it would be tragic for you to have come so far only for things to end  all i can really suggest is the usual stuff of practising relaxation and distraction have you explored or found anything that works for you sorry i didnt reply earlier i definitely relate to what youre saying   you mustnt feel stupid ridiculous or embarassed though the thing is anxiety is irrational and can make you automatically assume the worst  i suppose if what you were worried about was rational it wouldnt be considered anxiety at all the whole point is that its not always based on reality  so dont be too hard on yourself  to be honest id have been anxious too if i needed to contact someone and my phone was nearly out of battery so what you felt wasnt silly at all  you know you said you would have been able to get home anyway did you have that thought after all of this or were you able to reassure yourself at the time that you could have got home i think we live and learn and so next time anything like this happens you can draw on these experiences and hopefully reassure yourself whilst your panicking that there is a solution to whatevers going on hmm thats an interesting question   its hard to say if ive got more or less anxiety than i did 5 years ago  the intensity feels the same  however the nature of the things that give me anxiety has changed quite significantly  i think the anxiety i get now feels far more serious and based on reality welcome to the forum titus   its really difficult when your body seems to be constantly aching and not working as youd like it to be but dont underestimate the effect that stress and anxiety can have physically  personally ive found it difficult to accept that mental health can cause me to feel so physically unwell but it really does   anyway i think relaxation techniques like amathus has suggested is a really good place to start if its not something youve already tried welcome to the forum   waverunner is right it does take a while for medication to work however sometimes antidepressants can actually make things worse the risk is higher if youre 25 or under but it can happen to anyone  if you think this is the case then i would go straight back to your gp and explain whats going on there is a risk that if youre one of those people who find that antidepressants make you worse it could lead to suicidal ideation which you obviously dont want to be going through welcome to the forum hedgewitch    are you a hedgewitch by the way i do like a bit of hedgewitchery    youre definitely not dumping by posting here oh and im sorry to hear your husband doesnt always listen to you must get a bit frustrating sometimes   ive noticed youve said youre applying for a new job good luck with that  it sounds like your current boss is a bit of a nightmare fingers crossed youll find a less stressful working environment i dont like eating in public or being in crowded places so i understand that anxiety  you shouldnt let that stop you from celebrating though  that is if you want to celebrate chances are most people arent even looking at you  if theyre not talking to someone theyre probably on their mobile phone  its hard to get past that spotlight effect that anxiety has  that feeling everyone is looking at you and judging you  but it couldnt be further from the truth     oh and i know this is a bit of an aside but do i sound like a cow if i say that even if i had a boyfriend id still find the whole valentines day thing extremely embarrassing whilst im not diagnosed with gad i can definitely relate to what youre experiencing  tense achy body and hypervigilance i get startled to easily   i find a hot water bottle can help with the aching as for being so easily scared i tend to wear headphones and listen to music a lot so im not so sensitive to loud noises thats what sets me off more than anything an unexpected loud noise oh no youve really been through the wars havent you    get well soon mm and i hope youre not suffering too much  cracked ribs sound very painful do you really think shed react like that or is it your anxiety thats making you believe shell take what you say badly   i dont think you sound pathetic at all it sounds like youre struggling with anxiety anyway but this situation with your friend is a particular trigger and is making you feel a bit insecure   im sure that deep down your friend will always value your friendship more as youve known each other for longer and it sounds like youre really close   do you think you could be reassured by talking to your friend about your worries or do you feel that your worries are deeper than that  what i mean is sometimes in spite of assurance anxiety can continue regardless because thats just how anxiety is    i have to say that theres a situation similar to this in my own life except im the other friend  one of my friends has a best friend theyve known each other since they were small children and my friend describes her as a sister  the thing is i know that theyre really close and i respect that i wouldnt seek to change their friendship in any way id hate to think id caused friction between them  but its very hard because my friends friend doesnt seem to like me very much at all i think she feels insecure and as though im trying to take her friend away but thats far from the case  so yeah speaking from someone who understands this kind of dynamic from the others perspective you dont know what this new couple are feeling im sure that if they are mature kind people theyll completely understand that youve got a strong bond with your friend and nothing will change that i think youve come up with a pretty good way forward yourself yes counselling might help you its possible that you might need to see a psychiatrist for medication too but how much medication can make you feel better is pretty limited in order to help you move forward it takes a good combination of talking it through and finding better coping mechanisms it may be that you should see if there are any anger management courses in your area too it could well be due to adhd issues robo adhd is not something ive had and ill be honest and say i know very little about it and how it affects people in adulthood but its very possible it could be contributing  or maybe even causing  these outbursts i think this is all the more reason to talk to a professional who knows more about these things than i do its been a very long time that ive had sleeping problems   i can relate to what youre saying about a feeling of being unsafe around sleep  except im the opposite in which id rather be alone in my flat and cant sleep when im around other people even though on one level i trust people a part of me still has doubts  youre very vulnerable when you sleep   something that has helped me is putting a mosquitonet type thing around my bed you can get some that are actually really pretty mine has bunting around the hoop  i think having that layer of fabric around me helps me feel more protected  i also check all of my locks before i sleep that sounds like a really frightening and humiliating experience    it may be a side effect of medication i know its not always a wise move but have you read the patient information leaflet that came with your medication to see what the side effects were  sometimes it can help to take a look so that you know whether what youre experiencing is down to the medication or not  out of curiosity what medicine is it   i was also going to ask if youve ever heard of or have been diagnosed with dissociation at all  it sounds as though this may also be quite likely to explain what happened   its made far worse when youre feeling stressed and people do have that kind of amnesia that you describe   read up on dissociation if you havent already also see whether anything like what youve experienced has been listed as a potential side effect  and either way i really think you need to make your doctor aware of what happened welcome to the forum    i think that perhaps you should make an appointment with a different doctor and then ask them for a referral to a mental health team or any other specialist services in your area  the thing is you dont have to disclose precisely what your thoughts are about if you dont want to  if i were you id say something like i am having intrusive thoughts that are of a sexual nature and they are causing me a huge amount of distress  if they ask you to be more specific tell them that you are uncomfortable with describing them   am sorry to hear that youre struggling with this  i dont know if what i experience is classed as an intrusive thought or is more of a ptsd kind of thing  but often i get horrible images of things happening to my loved ones its really horrible and upsetting  i generally try to distract myself and if it gets too much take a nap so that i dont have to be awake or conscious probably not the best coping mechanism but it works for now have you been seen by a mental health specialist  a gp is only good to a certain extent it would probably be better if you could be seen by a psychiatrist or psychologist  it may also be that medication isnt the answer and you need an approach thats more focused on therapy and talking   would you feel able to ask your gp to be referred to the mental health team i really think you might be able to get more suitable help that way yes i have the same experience i cant keep my legs still at night and im a very longterm insomniac had trouble with sleep for at least the past 12 years when it started in my early teens thoth is right in that some benzodiazepines can help but these arent drugs that are prescribed willingly by doctors and if they did theyd only let you have a short course of them because theyre highly addictive  there are alternative things ive found helped  a hot water bottle putting a pillow under my knees drinking chamomile tea  i do think though that its an overall sign of being anxious though some medications can actually give you restless legs antidepressants antipsychotics hi welcome to the forum i noticed youre new   the trouble with most if not all medication is that there are side effects i do think that the first month or so on a new medication does leave you feeling a bit weird it takes a good couple of weeks to fully adjust  i bet if you look at the patient information leaflet that comes in the box with your medication youll find a lot of what youre experiencing is considered a common side effect  so while its not nice to experience it in some odd way it should be reassuring to know youre not alone with it and i do think these things will get better i had all kinds of symptoms starting my medication i can remember feeling very nauseous doing the jaw clenching feeling very spaced out i would say the dry mouth is the only symptom that has persisted and low sex drive but that doesnt matter to me  but yes similar to you ive found the benefits of my medication outweigh the unpleasant side effects they would have told you if your test had come back positive with the hiv  theres absolutely no way they wouldnt have told you  i suspect that the stress youre feeling may be making your herpes symptoms worse  stress and anxiety puts your body under more pressure than you might believe  it really can make you feel absolutely awful are you getting any help for your anxiety welcome to the forum i think its worth discussing this with a professional nobody here can really diagnose you and theyll be able to point you in the right direction are you on any medication for anxiety at all sometimes medication can cause this sort of thing though its very rare a friend of mine used to have a nervous tic but she got help and within 6 months it was gone am telling you that because i want you to know that its very possible to overcome this welcome to the forum i know its not always something people are willing to try but am wondering if youve been on any medication like an antidepressant for your anxiety the biggest thing that ive found makes a difference to my social anxiety is taking my citalopram i think its a really good idea to try and take supplements   have you ever tried a light box sometimes that can help too though im unsure as to when you should use it if youre working night shifts because it might just make your body clock worse   when you say youre worried about the sleep do you mean just not getting enough of it im pleased to hear that things are getting a bit better for you   i can recall seeing some of your posts in the past and know youve not been in a good place with your anxiety  have you read up on though distortions at all its by no means a cure by ive always found it helpful to identify how my thinking is wrongdistorted which in turn helps me come up with a more balanced thought welcome to the forum   occasionally i will get thoughts that im seriously ill usually i think i have a brain tumour or that im going to have a heart attack  but as you said its the anxiety itself which causes these symptoms and so its very easy to end up stuck in a vicious circle   i cant work out from your screenname if youre male or female sorry but am wondering if this feeling hot and feverish ties in with your menstrual or hormonal cycle at all  i know that i used to really sweat buckets and feel very hot before my period even though my temperature was actually fine there are websites out there where you can track your period and make a note of how you are feeling i used to use mymoodtracker   i wonder if its worth doing so that if you are experiencing a lot of anxiety about how youre feeling you might find it reassuring to see its part of a cycle and that youll feel better ooh this is a bit of an old thread but i want to recommend bach flower rescue remedy too  its really helped me in both every day and more acute anxiety x hey parissa   i think obviously only you can know whats best for you but just wanted to say that if you are really not coping the lorazepam is there to help  its still early days from when you came out of hospital and you should take as long as you need to feel better  i understand that perhaps youre eager to get back to work in january even though its making you anxious but remember that theres only one you and your wellbeing is the most important thing x panic attacks can be really horrible  im sorry that youre experiencing them and it seems youre experiencing them a lot too    its difficult enough to deal with anyway but it must be superdifficult in your line of work i know you already know this but i am sure if your colleagues knew what you were going through theyd be supportive its definitely not a sign that youre in any way incapable    in my experience when i get low blood sugar it can mimic the symptoms of a panic attack i get the shakes and really out of breath  so make sure you try to keep on top of that carry a banana or a cereal bar with you in your handbag so you know youve got something there water is really helpful for me too   its not so easy to just go to sleep if youre experiencing anxiety and youve got physical health issues but if you are having a sleepless night its still beneficial to be resting your body by lying down   also just want to say that if you did have a panic when your students are all there i can guarantee that someone in that class will be struggling with anxiety too and in an odd way would feel less alone if they knew that its actually not an uncommon thing   i really hope your appointment with the gp goes well and they can offer you support  ideally with any underlying physical issues and with your panic attacks glad to hear youve slept a little bit better last night hope that your sleeping keeps improving i get insomnia a lot and understand how being sleep deprived can make your mental health so much worse x i think its really difficult to find a balance  sometimes people genuinely cant face work and trying to have a job causes more problems than it solves  others do find it a distraction and gives them a sense of selfworth  how have you felt about working in the past  i suppose the worst than can happen is that you wont cope and youll have to go back to not working and in that sense you have nothing to lose by trying  however i can completely understand youre dread and anxiety about the situation i cannot cope with working at all and admire you for entertaining the thought  at the end of the day in spite of what the psychiatrist said i think only you know whats best for yourself x im sorry to hear about what happened with your dad  youre right your mothers reaction was understandable because of what had happened but in the nicest possible way it was an overreaction because surgery is pretty safe and the chances of something going wrong are very very small i mean i presume your previous procedure went ok there werent any complications  of course youre nervous i dont think youre a big baby at all its unsettling and the fact that they struggle with the iv means its going to be uncomfortable i relate to this by the way my veins impossible to find blood tests are a nightmare  im sure that those around you will understand you wont be up for cooking and all the preparation with thanksgiving could you delegate and ask for familyfriends to help out i bet theyll be only too pleased to be able to do something for you x thanks for sharing your experiences it can be difficult for people to acknowledge that theres a difference between being shy and suffering with anxiety i have found citalopram helpful for my anxiety too i noticed when i first started taking it that i was more natural and felt more at ease when talking to people i hope things continue to get better for you i can relate too   i think i am naturally an introvert and find too much stimulation stressful even without the mental health issues but its absolutely no fun being lonely and having no friends to call upon on the rare occasion when you do want to go out  i have such a big fear of groups  i hate being in a large group of people because i will inevitably be left out or isolate myself first so that itll seem like its my choice im alone    i think hamletcat is right though it can make a big difference where you socialise and the type of people you spend time with  ive found the most supportive environments to be at places like meditation workshops or art groups hello and welcome to the forum im sorry youve not had any replies yet   ive not been in your position myself but i do know that student services at least in the uk can actually be really good  dont be out off by having to fill out forms  i think these things are just there to please the penpusher types who need to have every box ticked   it may be that they are able to offer you the support you need to complete your degree  whether thats some kind of replacement for the proctor who is leaving or finding an alternative way for you to get what you need without having to go into a busy environment thats going to cause you anxiety hello not sure how long youve been a member here but i havent seen your posts before so welcome    i can really relate to some of what youve said  im 26 and ive never had a job i have a lot of anxiety and i think i do have issues around commitmentfeeling trappedbeing a real adult   but yeah i get all that negative selftalk about being a let down and not being like other people my age    its all crap by the way  you cant possibly compare yourself to anyone  everybody has their own unique mind and each face different obstacles   also success means different things to different people  one person might want a career and a fancy car another might want a loving family and somebody else still will want to travel the world and find inner peace    you are only 18 and i dont mean that in a patronising way i mean how wonderful to be so young   there are people twice your age living with their parents because things arent easy out there in the big wide world at the moment   you must stop putting pressure on yourself to follow this script that everybody else is following because youre not everybody else    i would say that volunteering is a great thing to do even if its only a few hours  i volunteer for 2 hours a week and it really does help shut up that voice that says i am a failure and i get a lot out of it   i suppose the next step would be perhaps to look at a parttime job or maybe a temporary job  that way you arent having to do a full on 95 job   i feel like im waffling a bit so ill leave it here for now im really glad to hear that the anxiety has got better for you though ill be completely honest  i havent found anything to help me bridge the gap between volunteering and paid employment   for me theres a lot more to lose if i try to get a job and fail also with my health it just isnt realistic for me to work at the moment    what has helped me a lot is going out to events and places where i know im going to meet safe people  for instance my volunteering is at an animal rescue centre i know that the people who work and volunteer there are going to be nice and caring people    when i was younger i went to a poetry cafe again people who go to something like that are going to be intelligent and in touch with their feelings also the venue was small the lighting was dim nobody was chitchatting because the main focus was on the person reading their poems    another trick i use is to say to myself that im allowed to leave a place at any time  i think the idea of having to be somewhere for x amount of time used to bother me because just the thought of spending 5 minutes out there in the world was scary enough  so even if you only get as far as walking through the door only to turn around and go back out again that in itself is still a really big achievement   knowing you dont have to be somewhere can help take the pressure off and you might find that you actually want to be there   it really is all about little steps and celebrating those small victories im not on a lot which is unusual for me i did have an appointment with the psychiatrist today but he said he didnt really want to change anything while im having therapy and that i should really give therapy my all not really what i wanted to hear because the therapy is crap but anyway im on citalopram and a low dose of quetiapine i dont think im on enough quetiapine to even have a therapeutic effect but it helps me sleep and just takes the edge off of things x no eventually you will wear yourself out and get some rest  however that can be a long and painful process  my psychiatrist once said to me when i was getting anxiety attacks that they will naturally burn themselves out   you were probably given something like lorazepam possibly even haloperidol in hospital   have you explained to any professional about your anxiety and insomnia it would be good if they could give you some prn meds or something to use when things get really bad x welcome to the forums  i think bullying can have a big impact on people more so than i think is acknowledged   i had a really hard time with being bullied and i think it triggered serious mental health problems in me  whilst youre no longer in that environment i think that the anxiety can continue on into adulthood im 24 and i know that im still in some way affected by the bullying still   just to clarify  have you only been selfharming since taking the citalopram sometimes antidepressants can make people worse and actually give them suicidal thoughts when they didnt have any previously if youre under 25 youre more at risk of these side effects  so its probably worth discussing this with your doctor   im pleased to hear that your compulsions have calmed somewhat though can understand your apprehension about things getting worse again in the winter   hopefully though youll still have the psychologist and doctor to support you if things did get worse x i know precisely what you mean and i agree that i think overthinking plays a huge role in anxiety  with my social anxiety for instance i find that when im in a group of people i dont know that well i am so in my head i feel like theres a part of me that desperately wants to let go and relax but this stupid overthinking part prefers to think what if i make an ass of myself what if what if   sometimes i overthink my body language too that has to be one of the worst situations have you ever done that oh my god its awful i just seem to fixate on where to put my hands does it look weird is it obvious im not comfortable etc   ive heard that changing up your body language in these situations can make a difference to how you feel  a fake it until you make it type thing if you sit or stand with confidence then apparently it helps    overthinking  the number one enemy of the anxious x err well ive seen all kinds of body language analysis having a good posture and not crumpling over apparently having your feet underneath you when sitting on a chair or stool is a sign of nervousness or submission with standing i think its a matter of keeping your head high and maintaining good eye contact  also apparently the more space you take up with your arms and legs the more confident you appear  i always make myself smaller which probably isnt a good thing x is your place carpeted  i dont know what your finances are like but with two dogs my mum insisted on laminate flooring  its much easier to keep the living space feeling cleaner with laminate rather than carpet   as for the sofas my mum often washes the covers too   im sorry encouraging you to clean more is not what i intend to be saying at all x hey  everyone has already given you such good advice that theres not much more i can say  i do wonder if what you are describing is a mild dissociation or depersonalisation  i remember feeling very much as you describe in the past i was a bit of a zombie had a bad headache which seemed to effect my eyesight and i genuinely felt insane as though my concept of reality had gone out of the window  now i know when i feel like that its just me having an episode of derealisation whilst its very scary and unnerving remember that anxiety makes these kind of symptoms much worse  if you are really worried about your health im sure that if you make an appointment to see a doctor they will help you to understand that your physical health is probably not the issue  i mean there are physical things that could be making you feel this way maybe an ear infection or sinus issues  it would be good to rule these things out x believe me the more stressed out you get about this the less likely your period will come to cut the long story short i had an incident where my period didnt come for 10 weeks and worried that i could be pregnant i blacked out and think i had my drink spiked the more i fretted it seemed the longer things took  eventually my period came after i read up on some herbal remedies i would seriously not recommend any herbs unless pregnancy is very very unlikely in my situation not only was i not sure that i was assaulted the forensic nurse made me take the morning after pill and so i was pretty sure that it was just the stress that delayed things anyway certain medications can also affect how effective the pill can be even the progesterone only pill i wonder if perhaps that coming off you meds has essentially made the pill more effective and stopped your bleeding  the reason i say this is because i no longer have periods since taking the progesterone only pill it seems to have stopped things altogether  the main thing i want to say is relax if you still dont start your period in a few days time it may be a good idea to see a nurse or a doctor most overthecounter pregnancy tests are only something like 98 accurate the doctors will be able to give you a blood test  im sorry that this causing you so much stress just try to chill and think of flowing thoughts x i am wondering if its worth your mum going to her own gp and explaining the situation saying that your dad needs a level of care that she is unable to give and to ask for there advice alternatively you could go to citizens advice it may be that social services could have some involvement or that they may be able to suggest some kind of home help particularly if hes had physical issues recently like the strokeheart problems it sounds like a very stressful situation for you and your mum hopefully theres something out there that can help take some of the weight off of you two x it can take a long time to find the right medication sometimes its a combination of more than one medicine that helps i am on citalopram i would not say i am anxietyfree however i do find that in some situations i am more confident when taking my medication i am unsure why a psychiatrist would say that an antidepressant could leave you anxiety free because i think thats a bit unrealistic particularly if the problem lies in your thought pattern because then its your thoughts you need to work on in therapy im glad youve found a more suitable psychiatrist for you and i hope that you dont have to keep trying all kinds of medication and feel better soon x welcome to the forum  yes i have experienced the same sort of thing im glad you went to the hospital and they didnt find anything physically wrong  are you on any medication at all at the moment i have experienced heart palpitations due to mental health medications x welcome to the forums   i think its quite common amongst people who suffer from anxiety to get anxious over health matters its something i know that i do a lot  i am pleased that you went to your doctors and had various checks and that they have confirmed you are in good health   unfortunately i dont have much advice with the sleep thing because you are very much describing the situation im in its been going on for years  i totally relate to your frustration with it all similar to you ive tried many things not allowing myself to over sleep allowing myself to sleep when i need and it seems that no matter what i do i always get tired  personally i think i suffer with chronic fatigue or possibly fibromyalgia but i think its very difficult to get a gp to diagnose that anyway but probably even harder if mental health issues are there   one thing i would say though is that its definitely worth seeing your doctor and asking them to run blood tests if thats not something they have already done there may be an issue with anaemia lack of vitamins thyroid problems etc and that needs to be ruled out  do you drink enough water i know that i sometimes feel better when i make an effort to up my water intake   this is just my own opinion not scientifically proven but i think that when i sleep a lot im obviously not having any fluid intake and so i wake up with a dry mouth and a bad headache the headache leads to lethargy and so the cycle continues  its definitely not a cure but it might help with energy levels   there are meds that you could be prescribed for sleep some are short term only but there are things that can help in the longer term   im really sorry youre struggling with this anyway i know how it feels and its bloody miserable  it really does stop you from living a normal life and engaging in meaningful activities  x i had a bit of a crash course in this type of thing as a child i was really scared of dogs if i saw one in the distance id freak out and cry  then through lots of persuasion our family got a puppy i could just about tolerate a pup theyre not that scary anywho through exposure to our dog and subsequently other dogs when i went for walkies i am now a dog lover   it does work just dont ask me to do the same with spiders  x because im on the first floor i can keep my windows open and not worry about anybody looking in so really my windows never get closed  the downside to that is i dont have a clue who or what people are talking about when i hear them outside  ive often heard phrases or names ie bitch  shes taking the piss etc and got worried that i was being talked about  i think youve just got to think logically and assure yourself that its highly unlikely that you are being talked about xx have you spoke to the doctorsdentist about this  i grind my teeth sometimes at night but if someone has heard you from downstairs  then its obviously quite a severe problem for you   which shield did you try the diy ones you get over the counter or a proper fitted one from the dentist   it sounds a bit daft but i wonder if chewing gum might help at least then youll have something between your teeth and it wont be as damaging x i really dont think there is a right or wrong way of dealing with this  i agree that i think youre doing the best you can  you could always ask your mum it sounds as if you and her can talk openly about what shes going through what approach she would find most helpful   i dont think theres a risk of enabling her   to be honest some people would find a tough approach very unhelpful and may even find it hurtful  also as shes been willing to go to the cbt and understands that she has issues i dont think you run the risk of enabling her because shes aware of her situation x welcome to the forums are you getting any professional input at the moment or is this something youre dealing with on your own i understand what you mean about being overwhelmed by anxiety and feeling that its completely taking over you mention it happens whenever you dont feel in control of a situation  are there particular examples you can think of the only reason i ask is that it can be helpful to try and find the root of anxiety x can you send an email or a text instead  i can really relate to this i despise phone calls it seems illogical doesnt it because with a phone call you have the advantage that you can just hang up if you dont like whats going on  you cant do that facetoface  for me i think the lack of visual cues like body language and facial expression is what makes me really anxious i dont like not being able to read people and i dont like people being unable to read me x this is just a random suggestion but you can get those wristbands that use acupressure to relieve nausea theyre sold for morning or travel sickness but it has helped me a bit with the nausea i get from anxiety x oh bums i wish you luck just remember if it all goes pear shaped you can just hang up and try again  x aww im really sorry youre feeling so bad has something in particular happened or are you just feeling a bit crap   please try and stay away from thoughts of ending it all    are you due to see any professional some time soon i know meds arent always the answer but im just wondering if something can be tweaked to help you feel calmer   sorry if ive misinterpreted what youve said but are you not sleeping well at the moment that can have a really bad effect on the way you feel i know that when im tired i get far more startled by noises than normal sometimes just the door buzzer is enough to give me a panic attack   sleeping with ear plugs really helps me in that sense   have you tried mediation or just listening to calming sounds ive read somewhere that listening to nature noises really helps lower stress its something that ive found useful in unwinding x as annoying as mums can be with putting a damper on things they are only thinking of the practicalities because they have your best interest at heart  it can be annoying and im sure that wanting to go ahead to prove her wrong is a response people can relate to however it is an emotional reaction and i think you need to think about this rationally   how long is it until you are due to go i am wondering if seeing a doctor before you go and explaining about your panicanxiety attacks is worth a go  they may be able to give you some advice or even medication to help   if it were me i would stay and cancel the trip australia is a long way from home having said that im not you and so am only answering from what i would do if i were in your position   you havent mentioned how old you are but im guessing your young enough that you could always do the aupairing in the future   having said all of that it may be something you can break through  i remember having a bit of an episode when i went on holiday with a friend i was so pissed offanxiousdepressed that i just wanted to come home  eventually i got over my wobble and made it through to the end of the holiday it was difficult but i did it   im sorry this is all conflicting and is probably not giving you much of a clear answer either way but then it ultimately is your choice x sorry to hear the anxietys almost through the roof  sending some steady calming vibes   hopefully with the diagnosis you might get some better help  i feel my anxiety is always overlooked because its not my main diagnosis hopefully you wont have that problem now x wait for your blood results it could indeed be a blood sugar issue but because your body remembers what the anxiety feels like your brain is getting tricked  if there is no physical explanation for it then it does sound like you could be having some kind of panic attacks especially if they are so out of the blue is there anything going on in the bigger picture of your life thats causing you stress  for your own sake it might be an idea to keep a diary too sometimes i feel really awful for what seems like no reason at all and its not until i reflect upon things that i realise something really subtle happened that actually could have served as a trigger it would be good to identify a trigger for whats going on wouldnt it that way youre better equipped to understand whats going on and to do something about it x have you told your therapist about this  it sounds like you need to sort out the feelings that are causing you to feel upsetunhappy the eating to calm down is just a coping mechanism for something else going on underneath i dont think your problem with eating will get better until you feel better  obviously its your decision about medication and if you can cope without them then thats really positive but personally ive found them very helpful i know there are side effects but for me the side effects are better than feeling unwell  im sure daily yoga would help if you can bring yourself to do it  do you drink much water sometimes i find that when ive had enough fluids then im not as hungry   anyway as ive said i do think you should mention this to your therapist if you havent already and explain how much its affecting you  i would also say that having therapy isnt always easy and can bring up painful memories and so this might be another thing causing you to feel sad x blueflames is right you probably would benefit from some counselling   though i see from your post that youre not doing so well financially as you said you didnt have money from being treated for allergies i presume youre somewhere where healthcare isnt free   im sorry life is being so challenging for you at the moment    do you have anybody around who can help you on a more practical level   not sure what your allergies are but if you can sort out your living environment so that triggers are eliminated that would be great am wondering if anybody is there to help you do that x dont really know what advice to give but just want to say i can really relate to what youre saying i suppose it depends on what the opinion is actually about for me there are things that i can let go of eg if someones slagged of a film i like but i must admit ive got myself really distressed and angry at some things ive read online particularly when theres a generalisation going on  if i wanted to i could probably destroy my faith in humanity within 2 minutes by reading certain things you have to remember though that its only really one individual expressing a view even if lots of people agree with them there will always be other people who dont agree and may well be as outraged as you are about certain things being said  i could go off on a bit of a rant but i dont want to bore you and also youve not really given much information on what sorts of things are upsetting you and so i may be getting the wrong end of the stick  but i suppose the only thing thats helped me is to avoid looking at things that i know are going to trigger me in some way fair enough things pop up where you dont expect them sometimes but usually you can see a title of a threadarticepost that you just know is going to piss you off its good to avoid those x you must ask your doctor this  in the nicest possible way i have no idea what all these words mean   plus as nobody here is a professional i dont think anybody can say for sure whether its safe or not so yeah better be safe than sorry and ask your doctor  welcome to the forum by the way x i dont know if its possible to necessarily reverse that overanalytical voice but from my own personal experience there are times when i find its not allconsuming i can very much relate to what you say about overanalysing to the point where you no longer know what to say i think for me nothing really seems important enough to say out loud  but then a lot of whats said is not really important people talk a lot of rubbish to be honest but taking part in some chitchat at least is a part of life though of course people naturally are introverts  i think maybe getting an awareness of thinking distortions you can google the term and find explanations and examples is one thing thats helped me i know when im catastrophising and assuming the worst is happening or when im mind reading and thinking that i know what people think of me to just be aware that thats distorted thinking sometimes is enough  it sounds like you spent a long time just not being able to relax or to be you i dont know what the army is like an so i dont want to make a judgement and present it as a fact but i get the impression that youre name personality and life story arent seen as important my impression is that they dont really care who you are as an individual and that you are taught to be both cut off and on alert simultaneously i could be very wrong though  one thing that has helped me is antidepressant medication i do find then numbing but in some ways it can be helpful for that anxiety because i find it loosens the grip that it has on me and enables me to be more of an observer  of course ultimately what is going to help is gently reintroducing yourself to the world getting out there start small it might only be a onceaweek class or something but its a vicious circle when youre a bit trapped inside i know from experience  x i know this is a bit of a cliche but you have to remember that everybody is nervous when they take their driving test the examiner will appreciate that fact have you tried bach flower rescue remedy for me its quite effective take the pastels rather than the drops to be on the safe side the drops have a very tiny amount of alcohol in but just to be on the safe side what i mean is it wont affect your driving but it does have a slight smell of brandy probably not good if someone smells it on you   also as ng said get in as much practise as you can   another thing is even if you make a mistake and think thats it ive failed dont get disheartened youre allowed 15 minor faults i stalled at the traffic lights on the way back to my local test centre and got really disheartened thinking id messed up almost started crying there and then turns out because i checked my mirrors and handled the situation in a safe manner i passed  good luck with it positive thinking eh x i dont know what mentally healthy people do though i think youre on to something  im convinced that they dont spend much time selfreflecting or analysing themselves  though im not sure how easy it is to practise looking outwards if it doesnt come naturally to you dont know if it is something you can just do permanently and make everything go away i know that distraction helps a lot so in that sense looking outward is a good thing to do sorry im being a bit vague and not being much help just wanted to say that i agree with your observation and what youve said is food for thought x i would say its some kind of dissociative state  though cant diagnose you obviously   i agree with the suggestion of speaking to a doctor if this is bothering you theyll know the right questions to as you and might be able to help get to the bottom of whats wrong and whats causing you to feel that way x yeah dont go on a bender    seriously though im glad the doctor was a decent person and treated you with respect  wishing you the best of luck with your trial hopefully it can finally be over you dont need to feel bad about only posting on here when youre feeling upset    thats really frustrating about your work hours i can completely understand how disappointed and let down you must be feeling sometimes it only takes one thing to have a domino effect and eventually you can get really down i cant see why they werent able to give you the extra hours you wanted but there   im not trying to pry but how does losing out on housing benefit and having your council tax affect you financially will you be able to cope im wondering if there is any more support that might be available to you though i dont really know how the situation is for people who dont have full time hours   anyway as your title says youve never felt this bad before im wondering if youre having a depressive period are you getting any help for mental health issues xx i dont think its too much to ask and im sorry youve not had a reply yet  im in a similar situation myself really  im very isolated and have no friends that i can really spend time with i also have weight issues probably due to lack of exercise but i mainly comfort eat because i feel so alone  have you got any support in terms of mental health services are there any places that run activities for people with mh issues in your area like mind or rethink i think that is something thats really lacking in society  peer support  also im not sure if youve checked to see on the local forums section whether or not there are services in your area mentioned that might be worth exploring  i would say its all about little steps and if you find yourself feeling particularly good one day make yourself go out even if its for a short walk down the road   other than that ive found certain activities like meditation classes or artcraft courses tend to draw in people who are generally quite supportive and the environment has been really safe for an anxious person like me im sorry youve not had a response yet  have things got any better  it does sound to me like you might have a problem with agoraphobia i say agoraphobia but obviously i dont know if you fear open spaces or if its generally more of a sense of being scared of people or something bad happening   if youre housebound and this has been going on for months i think you should contact your gp and have a telephone conversation with them because it doesnt seem likely that you would be able to attend an appointment  its one thing to be content to be indoors but its different if you find yourself wanting to go out but not being able to i think perhaps aiming to go to your grandmothers is a good idea how will you get to her house  i can see how youre in between a rock and a hard place to stay in will drive you potty but going out is obviously a huge challenge for you  i would encourage you to try to go to quiet places first as a means of getting more confident with going out perhaps going for a walk in nature  i dont know if you like animals or if theres a dog rescue centre near you but places like that are always looking for volunteer dog walkers whats nice about that is you have some form of company in the way of a dog but its nothing too overwhelming perhaps thats there to think about in the future  does your gp know you have these issues by the way thats fair enough conventional psychiatric help doesnt always help people live more fulfilling lives   i can see how you want to chuck yourself in at the deep end because youre feeling desperate as i said this trip to see your grandmother sounds like a good place to start is the train journey long do you have anything you can take with you like a book or crossword to hopefully keep you occupied yeah there is a stereotype of an agoraphobic isnt there  i think in reality the condition varies  as with other mental health issues no two sufferers are exactly the same   im not sure what to suggest really i struggle with anxiety when im out and about dont like meeting new people hate crowds dont like being in groups i fear im in the way etc   so yeah while i know what its like to have certain struggles im not quite sure if i have any words of wisdom  just wanted to say im sorry that youre having these issues   it really does have a huge impact on your quality of life i do think its a good suggestion to perhaps try to seek out friendships where you can do the things you enjoy without putting any pressure on your relationship   has your partner ever sought any professional help  it must be difficult anyway but perhaps even more so if hes not currently working through his issues with the right support   also im wondering if there are places that he feels safe to go to not sure if you or him drives but do you think somewhere quiet and peaceful like a local woodland would be somewhere hed be willing to go to  i think with any kind of mental health issue its about taking little steps towards recovery and so even if 5 minutes in a peaceful place is all he can manage then thats a good start welcome to the forums    i dont have much else to add really to what gajolenes already said  its worth trying the sertraline but go back to the gp straight away if you find that you feel worse when taking them  ssri antidepressants and some other medications can actually make people feel more suicidal and under 25s are at a higher risk of this happening  am not trying to say this to alarm you by the way just think its good to know just in case you do find yourself feeling lower   i really hope that you find they work for you anxiety and panic attacks are really horrible to deal with welcome to the forum   im really sorry to hear that your dad was unsupportive some people just dont understand mental health very well at all im sure youd much rather a normal life  its not like youre having this anxiety because its fun   im glad that you had a friends place to stay at though i think taking bagpuss advice and contacting your local council would be wise   how long have you been on the sertraline it can take a while to kick in or it may be that other meds are more suited or that youre more a candidate for therapy  its early days either way so please dont lose faith ive only just seen this  i hope youre ok hunny and im sorry that youve had to deal with yet more shit from him i really hope you refrained from any si because you dont deserve to be punished at all   im really sorry to hear about your experience i think id have been really upset and frightened too  i think a lot of people are so quick to lose their temper but as you said it was an honest mistake on your part its not as if you got your car stuck for the fun of it   i know its easier said than done but please dont take what the guy said on board   his outburst wasnt personal because he doesnt know you   anybody could have been in your position and i expect he would have had a temper tantrum at them oh it says in the first post march anyway that really sucks what a complete farce eh and im not too bad thanks for asking i dont have a panic attack disorder but do get panic attacks occasionally when things are bad   how do i deal with them here are my tips   put your hands on a flat surface if there is a table or counter you can lean on thats good sometimes putting your hands flat on a wall can help too its good to feel physically stable  if you are scared you might pass out sit down they recommend putting your head between your legs in a sitting position im a bit too fleshy and not flexible enough for that personally so cant say if it helps or not because ive not tried it   affirmations its ok usually i cant cope with any longwinded affirmation when im in the thick of it but just telling yourself its ok its alright can be quite comforting remind yourself that it will pass   breathing proper big breaths like imagine youre blowing up a balloon i find puckering my lips like im blowing up a balloon helps too you might look a pillock but it is helpful    when you start to feel a bit less wobbly just take some small steps to get back in your body take it easy   go and get a glass of water  if youre prescribed prn meds take one of those if they help and youre allowed to do that   have a bloody good cry about it too its ok  x presuming youre in the uk your first port of call for this would be a gp i dont know if youd be too anxious to make an appointment but it could be worth it if it means you get some support  do you think the reason youre so anxious about work related stuff is because of the unemployment id say its natural to some extent to be anxious about searching for work its an emotionally draining process i think but if the anxiety and low mood are preventing you from taking opportunities andor affecting your quality of life id say its definitely worth you speaking to your gp this is basically what i was getting at in my reply to another thread of yours i dont know how open minded you are to alternative therapies but i do think theres more help out there in the holistic healing field than on the nhs having said that there are people who have mentioned they are having some kind of trauma therapy so it may just depend on the area you live in  my understanding of the way forward with this is to take a body  mind approach to healing in lots of different ideasphilosophies emotional pain and trauma stores itself in the physical body basically you have to access where its stored inside of you to enable you to explore and release the anxiety and trauma it is a long process but im sure you understand that things wont change overnight  ive had different soul healings shamanic that have helped me far more than any medications reiki is also good also ive heard good things emdr eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing from what i know of it they make you move your eyes around until you find that you are looking in a direction which makes whatever youre trying to work on feel the most accessible the therapist then talks you through and helps you desensitise to the triggermemory  i think its trial and error but you can eventually find something that helps  x i suppose the brain hasnt really evolved much i dont know i think the brain can get to the point where any stimulus stimuli is seen as a threat  im sure ive read somewhere that physiologically excitement and fear are not that different its just the accompanying thoughts that make one more pleasurable than the other so i think being happyactive can be interpreted as unhelpful nervous energy hence the shutting down x ohh ive just discovered this thread  im not an agoraphobic and luckily my panic attacks are very scarce but nonetheless i do get quite high anxiety  my balance is shite    also ive read that oestrogen levels affect balance and coordination i take the pill so dont get periods any more but when i used to i used to get so clumsy and was even more poor at parking than usual ahem when i was premenstrual i also used to feel even more stressed and anxious than usual at the thought of being out anywhere even if it was to the local shop  wonder if its linked   sorry i cant really add anything or give any helpful links just wanted to say thanks to you and monkee for the posts its an interesting idea x sometimes medication can cause blurred eyesight im on citalopram and i find thats made my vision worse  also as im sure you know crying will cause swelling in your eyes and blood vessels and so that will also make your vision cloudy  as youve been to the doctorsopticians etc i do think that your eyesight problems are maybe more anxiety related   oh and the floating specs are called sometimes known as floaters and theyre basically dead cells floating around the surface of your eyes  not nice but not harmful either attacks are different every time sometimes you dont always get the same symptoms and it can be more subtle but obviously noticeable ive been told the difference between an anxiety attack and a panic attack is that an anxiety attack happens for a good reason eg youve got social anxiety and youre asked to read something out in front of other people whereas a panic attack is out of the blue and for no logical reason at all so it does sound like youre getting panic attacks even if sometimes theyre not totally debilitating its hard whether someones dealing with anxiety or panic but panic is more difficult in the sense that if you dont know whats triggering you its not so easy to help yourself avoid getting an attack  i understand youre apprehensive but its great that youre seeing your doctor to be honest they might not just write out a prescription usually they make more suggestions on selfhelp whether its relaxation techniques or a cbt type course or ive even had my doctor suggest a good book to read let us know how it goes and yes it can lessen and become controllable its just early days for you at the moment youll get there i also experience this it might be worth seeing your doctor especially if youre particularly at risk of sleep apnoea  i would say though that its more than likely mental health related being particularly anxious or stressed out can make this gasp thing happen  if its really bothering you try to do what you can to make your sleeping environment better make sure the space is calm and free of clutter and electricals i know its winter but also ive found having a fan next to my bed helps me breathe better no but only because i didnt need to most places are pretty good with customer services and wont even ask for an explanation i mean this in the nicest possible way but i think you might be overthinking i know i do it myself  its easy to get caught up thinking what if they ask why im returning this item and trying to get an excuse prepared but ive never had anybody at customer services ask why im returning an item theyre more than likely just wanting to help the customers always right so they say bumping this thread in hopes that someone may be able to give a more detailed answer its not something i know much about have you asked her what you could do to help make her feel better im sure regular contact with help obviously but it may be that shell have some ideas of how you can help once shes a bit calmer and more accepting of your decision to go ok so what is it about public transport that you dont like im assuming its the social side rather than the fear of getting in an accident or whatever just remind yourself of what you have achieved in the past it sounds like you managed to get yourself feeling better off your own back without anybodys help do you know what the root cause of this anxiety is were you bullied or anything or just a shy kid if you can identify some of the reasons behind your feelings it would give you something to work on yeah i really relate to what everybodys saying here  my avoidance behaviour is really bad   i used to only get petrol at the 24hour garage early in the morning about 2am after some chavs in a car shouted fatty really loud over the forecourt and totally humiliated me it wasnt until i got the same guy serving me every time i went and he kept wanting to have a proper conversation with me that i went back to going to the garage at a more sensible time  i go to the supermarket at night too and sometimes go to the one in the next town over i remember driving 15 minutes to a coop in the next town to avoid having to go to the one on my high street  its crazy really   oh and who else waits til theres no sign of any neighbours around before leaving the house bet its not just me x welcome to the forum  dont really know about the thing with the blankets do people who sleep walk have awareness of what theyre doing ive never really understood sleepwalking  sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between dreams and reality i find even more so if youre generally quite stressed  sorry to hear about your panic attacks theyre really unpleasant anyway but much more difficult to calm yourself when youre in public x i think its natural for you to want to cry  leaving school and moving out are two both very significant events in life and both very bittersweet  its bound to give you anxiety i mean have you ever lived away from home before  are you living alone in your new place   go easy on yourself being emotional in your circumstances are quite a common experience    sorry if ive missed anything but do you have a mental health diagnosis if i were you id keep an eye on yourself particularly if these feelings dont ease off after a while   jonwal is right also in that this is potentially a great opportunity its a testing time when youre first independent but it can be very rewarding too x i dont have kids so dont really know the ins and outs of this sort of thing but it definitely sounds like asking the community nurse for some guidance would be a good thing im surprised you havent already been offered some help with it how are people meant to know what to write hope you can tackle this soon and get it out of the way so its one less thing to stress about x welcome to the forum  it sounds like your sister is in a lot of distress and has been for a while now i can understand how that must be having an impact on the whole family particularly your older parents who are finding themselves in a position of having to care for her  as toastedcrumpet said its still very early days  the fact that she is engaging with mental health services is a really good sign and hopefully staff will make note of her behaviour and hopefully she will get some help   are you in the uk i know that whenever ive been in a mental health unit there has been an opportunity for a meeting with family along with professionals  i think it would be really good if you could have the chance to talk to somebody perhaps at the unit shes staying in and express your concerns   it sounds like she needs some support to live an independent life and shes not getting it    i really hope that this is the start of her recovery x ah thats a really great thing to do  unfortunately i dont have a garden and so dont really have a safe space for a fire  but ive done it at different ceremonies outside sometimes ive even been extra careful and burned a piece of paper with things i want to let go of written on with a candle x there has been research to show that facebook actually makes people feel more depressed  you have to understand that what you see posted is only a carefully chosen segment of someones life people dont generally tend to share the details of how boringsadunfulfilling their lives are on there it is an illusion and you have to be clever about these things and see past it all   when you use facebook how do you access it is it on your laptop or a phone or both  one thing that has helped me is no longer having it set as a favourite website i also log out after browsing which means that i have to sign in every time i want to use it  this all helps me use it more consciously   i think doing something like that could help i can imagine having no account at all would be too difficult and in this day and age it seems that there is a feeling that youre missing out if you dont have it  but if you can use it more mindfully  perhaps limit accessing it through your laptop only doing what i do by signing out after every session and interrupting that part that is fooled by how wonderful other peoples lives seem to be   i dont think youre too old to change or to have a satisfying life i dont think its ever too late for anyone to make positive changes  sometimes youve just got to start with small things   do you have much of a social life what kind of things do you like to do  perhaps you could see what groups and activities there are in your local area ive found that even if its just something on for one afternoon a week getting out and having that to look forward to can really help   it probably feels a bit rubbish and overwhelming at the moment but i do think its positive that youve identified your life just isnt working for you hopefully you can be empowered now to take control and start thinking about what changes youd like to see and how you can go about making those changes is small manageable steps x as maya j said its definitely not too late to do things differently youve done so well from the sounds of things i know you might not feel like it but to juggle all of the things that you do must be really hard work and the fact that you have more ambition still is a credit to you i can see how the fact that you dropped college to be in a job where youre having issues with colleagues must be really frustrating id be pretty pissed off but anyway its not too late to make a plan of action x oh thats not nice i experience something similar  have you spoken to a doctor about it i think its important to rule out anything else like fibromyalgia or some other underlying physical issue personally i just try to get by the best i can but if it gets too much i take painkillers obviously its not a good idea to have them too often but if theres something you need to be doing but dont feel able to due to the pain then it doesnt hurt to take some painkillers  im sorry i dont really have much advice i just experience the same thing so can sympathise x first of all welcome to the forum   it does sound perhaps like a bit of an anxiety thing i think youre on to something though when you say that your intelligence is something that you value highly and in your own words you feel without it you would have nothing and so because its so important to you it sounds almost as if youre rigorously checking to see if youve still got it just my own thoughts but i do wonder if this is a reflection of not such great selfesteem in other areas i mean do you feel you feel you have other good qualities  im 24 and feel the same way our generation is odd isnt it  though i dont have a physical disability i had admissions for my mental health and got home tuition from the age of 13 onwards i didnt have a social life and still dont really i sporadically see the few friends i do have and so i can relate to your situation in some ways  personally i feel missing out on those normal teen experiences has had a detrimental effect on me in terms of my social skills i have the loneroutsider complex and cant do small talk i wish i could do small talk but i just genuinely dont know what to say   if i were you i would mention this to the psychologist youre seeing while the appointment may be initially to explore the possibility of add i think that the psychologist should help you with this and give you some more insight into it x i hear what youre saying but do you think it might be easier with a trained advocate whos obviously professional and you dont have to worry about upsetting the issue of cyclothymia does need to be raised and you need to know what they are doing to help you i wouldnt advise lying but i do think you should lay it on pretty thick to the doctor and explain just how much your moods are affecting you   are you due to see a psychiatrist soon at all do you have any upcoming appointments x i dont know how much research has been done on it ive read that its not a good idea to mix antidepressants and st johns wart  but never really heard much about rhodiola roseas effects  if i were you id ask the doctor im sure it would be safe but its better to get some medical advice first x ive done something a bit similar before only i was having suicidal thoughts and i told the staff that was what i was feeling so i was there all night from about 1030pm until my mum picked me up the next morning i waiting for a psychiatrist to see me and that happened at around 4am   i dont know im sure you would be asked by staff after a while what you were doing there after a couple of hours if they hadnt already clicked theyd see that you were on your own not waiting for someone   sorry i cant be more helpful lol i think if they knew or felt you were feeling vulnerable theyd let you be xx i dont know if its normal or not but if its causing you distress then something needs to be done to help you i saw on your other thread that you said you have had meds and counselling  are you getting anything like that at the moment you should go to your gp and explain how youre feeling im sure what youre experiencing is bad enough and so i think that the getting support you need soon will prevent you from feeling a lot worse x have you done anything that might upset him or might warrent him being on the lookout for you im just wondering im not trying to belittle what youre saying but obviously i dont know what youre mental health issues are or if youre prone to paranoid thoughts it may be that hes barely even thinking about you if its been a few weeks i can imagine its not a nice situation to be in though  theres someone in my town im scared of bumping into not because im scared that theyll hurt me its just we had a big falling out and its bound to be awkward but its been 10 months and ive not seen them even once hopefully next week you can talk to the doctor about how youre feeling and they might be of some help to you x hey i know some of the dates here are referring to august as its now october are things still pretty much the same for you it seems things arewere really getting intolerable for you are you on any meds or are you seeing any professionals what sounds really tricky is that from what youve said theres no identifiable trigger to your anxiety its as if its more part of who you are than an illness thats come about as a result of something do you keep a diary at all maybe it might be useful to you to see if you can identify what sets the episodes off it could be something really subtle but writing down what you did at the end of each day might help im not going to be irritating and say you should cut down on the drinking im sure its something you already know eating food quickly can be an issue particularly if youre not chewing the food enough the larger the bits of food going into your stomach are the more acid it has to produce in order for it to break down that can cause stomach upset im very guilty of skipping breakfast myself so cant really say much but it is important even if its just a cup of tea and the breakfast biscuits you can buy some of them are quite tasty it kick starts your metabolism in the morning  drinking water is really important especially if you do drink alcohol because thatll help flush toxins out have you tried milk thistle capsulestea thats also really good for a bit of detox also i know that having excess saliva is a sign youre about to be sick so by having a dry mouth its sounds very much more of a panicanxiety thing than a medical im sorry youre experiencing it though it sounds crappy have you ever had any therapy cbt in particular it might be worth contacting whoever is responsible for your care ie your gp or mental health team and asking for a referral its like youve almost got a preoccupationbit of a phobia developing though im no expert good luck and hope things improve soon hey ive not read any of your previous posts so not sure about whats been going on for you but im really sorry to hear things are really crappy at the moment sending you lots of love do you have anybody professional family friends that are looking after you at home unfortunately emotional things wont go away overnight but im just checking that youre physical needs are being seen to especially if you cant leave the house much at the moment do you have enough food etc first of all welcome to the forum   it sounds like youve had really horrible experiences in your life and im truly sorry to hear that  for whatever reasons it sounds like your parents and aunt were incapable of giving you the support and love that you needed and understandably it affected your selfesteem which in turn made building friendships really hard  i have to say that from what youve written you are incredibly insightful and intelligent when it comes to putting the pieces of your story together and identifying how things have affected you thats a really big advantage when it comes to making some changes  have you had any counselling or therapy at all it can be difficult to go over painful experiences but ultimately it can also be really helpful  i do think that you could do with some help with processing your past and looking forward to how you want your future to be hopefully they can help you take small steps towards changing things when the time is right and youre ready  of course seeing a counsellor or therapist involves putting some trust into someone but its a safe environment so its a good place to start something like this will take time but maybe now youre getting to the point where the pain of the loneliness is greater than the fear of people  finally just want to say youre not an outcast at all and by all means stick around the forum  there are lots of us here who find it difficult to get out and have a normal social life hi its not something i suffer with but 48 years is a long time for you to deal with this on your own so i really hope that you can get some help soon  do you know what the reasons are behind this is it being selfconscious of not thinking youre good enough a fear of picking up on germs or generally feeling uncomfortable with anybodys anatomy  i wonder if its been difficult to get help with because its not quite clear what exactly it is about it that makes you so anxious spiders i usually kill the bastards as soon as i see them problem solved  x you definitely would benefit from counselling from the sounds of things  why are you being pushed down the waiting list  who has referred you i would go back to whoever has referred you and explain just exactly what an big impact this problem is having on your life its not good enough to keep you waiting  i wouldnt go as far as saying im phobic of men but i have definitely had major anxiety issues im by no means free of it even now but i have come a long way from how i was several years ago  i think whats helped me is spending time around men in a mixed safe environment and just spending time in nonthreatening situations  if youve got a lot of bad experiencesmemories around men then you need to create experiences that are more neutral so that eventually you have more scenarios where things were ok to draw on hope that makes sense  i found going to a pottery group has helped a lot it was mainly women but the men that were there were much older and were totally nonthreatening and because the course was practical there was no pressure to have conversation it was just a case of being and making things in a calm environment   i do think im going on a bit now so ill stop here  i would suggest making some noise about the counselling to the right person and when youre ready just gently start putting yourself in situations that expose you to men but situations that are safe and that you can get out of if youre uncomfortable x i suppose people may see a car accident as unlikely to happen to them although the danger is greater there is a lower chance of something bad happening whilst the fear of embarrassing or humiliating yourself in front of a teacher or pretty girl could be quite high  i dont know those are just my thoughts i can really relate to this ive never worked and cant ever imagine myself settling into a job i just cant i think i have similar feelings to you with regards to the social anxiety and paranoia  if i try to imagine being in work i see myself having panic attacks andor selfharming in toilet cubicles like i used to in secondary school before i got the home tuition omg yes i remember on a caravan holiday i went on with the fam when i was around 5 or 6 it was in the south of france and a hornet came into our caravan  i remember being absolutely stunned at the size of it it was almost like i was so mesmerised by the sight of it i forgot to be scared    i used to freak out about wasps a lot then i got stung a couple of years ago and it was much less painful than i remembered it to be when i was stung as a child so they dont bother me as much  i do have bug killer spray i know its not very nice but i do kill them if theyre not rescueable  for some reason ive always been alright with bees i think because i was told they die when they sting ive got the impression theyre more reluctant to sting you plus they just seem a bit slower a dopier than wasps x hi juhls  as you can see this thread is a few years old  most members who have posted here are no longer active members  have you tried some of the things mentioned here such as exposing yourself to your fear perhaps by ice skating  i can understand where this might come from i am very unstable on my feet anyway and have a fear of slipping over    am sorry that i cant be more helpful hopefully as this thread has been bumped some other people here might be able to give you bettermore specific advice i agree i mean would they really be missed   oh and im sorry about your 8leg experience crumpet now they truly are evil little creatures x stress can manifest itself in lots of physical ways i find i have issues with eyesight too i am shortsighted to a point and have astigmatism so my vision isnt great anyway but when things are bad my eyes can be problematic  are you sleeping enough obviously tiredness can be a cause of this sort of thing  you can get products that help like eye drops to help these kinds of eye problems ive even seen recently that you can get a spray that you apply when your eyes are closed if youre someone that finds applying eye drops difficult sometimes putting cold cucumber slices over your eyes for a few minutes can provide a bit of relief but just a bit of warning from my own experience the cucumber slices have made my eyes water too much and ive found it makes my vision worse temporarily x i dont have much in the way of advice but im in a similar position to you im very isolated and have been for a long time youre right its very hard to get out of this position social anxiety is different from general anxiety although it can be hard to know whats what   for the past few years ive been on citalopram and its helped my social anxiety a huge amount i would say that now im just anxious rather than socially anxious if that makes any sense   in the past when ive had social anxiety the symptoms for me would be very physical  whenever i had to be around people or talk to someone id get all of the classic signs of anxiety shaking dry mouth rapid heart beat cant breathe i would feel completely paralysed  i completely avoided all eye contact and would blush if i had to talk id have to hide my hands because theyd be shaking   i also never said anything because not only was i afraid id say something stupid id also be so wrapped up in my anxious thoughts that id miss what people were saying to me  i just couldnt stop thinking that i was going to embarrass myself    although i still now have anxiety and get anxious around people i can give eye contact and have a conversation if i have to i wouldnt be able to do that before yes  ive been in a group who were having a laugh and i really wanted to join in but its like hitting a wall i totally get it   as i said it was taking the citalopram that helped me if i stopped taking it which i did for a brief period a few years ago i notice the difference straight away so its not really cured as such its just better managed with medication its early days with the medication you might find it really helpful although its not a miracle cure how long have you been with your therapist  have you tried breathing exercised andor meditation its a bit of a cliche but learning how to manage your breath can be really effective when you experience a panic attack deep breathing has helped me out many times im really sorry i cant make any big suggestions it sounds like what youre experiencing is really quite distressing  i just hope you feel better soon i think that a combination of therapy and medication might help ok so are you familiar with depersonalisation thats the term for feeling like youre watching yourself it happens to me a lot and the more anxious you are the worse it gets   when they suggested cbt did you say youd had it in the past and it wasnt helpful if they know youve had it before and its not worked the might be able to suggest something else   you say your doctor has given up on you what makes you think that you can change your doctor im not sure if you mean a gp or a psychiatrist but its possible to change either most mental health teams have more than one doctor  also did you ask to see a psychologist sometimes you really need to spell out to these people what it is you want and if they disagree  ask them why they dont think its appropriate for you to access these services  a while ago i wanted to try cat but my cpn at the time said she didnt think it would be right so i asked her why and she says that the nature of cat means you need to be pretty stable while youre having it you need to be well in order to be analysed so to speak i suppose it means you can be more objective when looking at the patterns of thoughtsfeelings and so you stand more of a chance of really understanding yourself it makes sense really   how did the people who carried out the assessment leave things with you are you waiting for hear back from them it might be worth calling them and explaining that you were a bit nervous during the assessment and there were a few questions you had that youd forgot to ask then tell them exactly what you need im not surprised youre overwhelmed sounds like youve got a lot on your plate sorry that thats going on with your family am i right in assuming you live with them its hard when someones home environment is stressful when they have mental health issues because at the end of the day you can be getting the best treatment  but if youre being put under stress on a daily basis then youre not going to make a full recovery i hope that when you go for a proper diagnosis and get seen by somebody then can start to really help you and give you the care that you need fingers crossed that youll start to feel better soon hi sorry youve not had a reply yet   i do think social anxiety and paranoia can definitely overlap and it can be hard to know what it is youre experiencing   what kind of paranoia are you having sometimes people can experience paranoia and it isnt a form of psychosis  a more psychotic form of paranoia would involve someone being out of touch with reality hello and welcome to the forum    im no professional but it does sound to me like you are experiencing social anxiety  there isnt always a reason for mental health issues sometimes it just happens  even without an obvious trauma in your life   you really arent overreacting youre not fake youre not looking for an excuse and youre certainly not a whiney baby   its just at the moment youre experiencing some crappy stuff    youre right in that uni is a different vibe from secondary school however there is no denying that it is a similar environment and so it makes sense that some of the feelings you had in school are present at uni   i do think it would be a good idea to reach out to someone but if your university is away from your home its not easy to decide who that should be   id really recommend seeing a gpdoctor as a starting point though  i understand your reluctance but there might be all sorts of things available that might really help and they will be able to point you in the right direction   another suggestion would be to see what student services are available at your uni the only thing with that is that i dont know how specific it would be  there might not be anything targeted at helping anxiety   you might be offered counselling or something though which could help you get out a bit and have someone to chat to about whats happening in your life   have you tried joining any groups or clubs at your university you might not be ready for that or there might not be anything that floats your boat but its worth considering if you looking to make friends   finally i want to say i just wish i could be your friend i hate the thought of anybody having lunch alone ive been that person and its not nice so sending a big hug your way hello and welcome to the forum   well i think youre right in that this does seem to be textbook social anxiety though of course im no professional  i experience it to some extent at the moment but social anxiety was a huge problem for me in the past and so i have a lot of empathy for what youre going through the dread of saying something  no matter how insignificant  its can be completely disabling and leave you feeling like utter crap   my advice would be for you to seek out some professional help  im not sure where youre based but if youre in the uk then make an appointment with your gp and explain whats happening  there are some selfhelp books out there which might be a place to start but its not going to be the thing that really makes a huge difference in my opinion  if you could get some form of therapy maybe cognitive behavioural therapy then i think it might help  im not sure how you would feel about taking medication i definitely wouldnt want to try to persuade you either way but just in case its of interest taking citalopram has had a hugely positive effect on my social anxiety   also do you get out much when youre not working hope you managed to make an appointment  the medication im on is prescription only  side effects were only noticeable in the first week or two i felt quite nauseous and my eyes a bit blurry but i also found it helped me almost immediately which is why i stuck with it   good luck with your meeting   also tabbykittens advice on breathing techniques is very good its another thing ive found can really help i think broddo could be onto something its far easier to dominate and control someone who doesnt appear very confident  i have had the same experience  any man ive had involvement with has been really bad and i do think its because of my anxiety giving off a vibe of powerlessness hi josie sorry that youre struggling with this  it can be really uncomfortable to deal with cant it whats helped me was practising in situations that dont necessarily matter making quick eye contact with a shop assistant when paying for goods for example i think what ultimately helped me though is generally lowering my anxiety levels for me this was done by medication and getting out more and being in company that was supportive eye contact was a problem for me at a really young age whenever i found myself talking to adults   other kids parents and helpers at my playschool  id never look at them when i spoke more often than not id look at my mum as if i were answering to her rather than whoever spoke to me i dont know why it was that bad at such a young age about three  even more odd i was never like it with kids my own age i could look at them fine   thats a really interesting idea its only been in my adult life that ive realised how bad my dad is at giving eye contact hell look the immediate family in the eye but anybody else and he wont look at them again only really since growing up have i realise how shy he is i wonder if that went in subconsciously somewhere hi honeybee welcome to the forum  this is an old thread thought it has had relatively recent posts still i want to make you aware you might not get a massive amount of responses    i can really understand how much this issue can affect you   i used to be terrible when it came to making eye contact   i suppose what helped me was improving my overall anxiety levels   yes medication was a part of that but i also used to slowly make steps forward  say for instance when paying for an item in a shop id make sure that id make eye contact with the shop assistant at least once melandcj has given some really fantastic advise    i just wanted to add that social anxiety isnt a weakness  i think its common for those of us who are socially anxious to generally be quite sensitive intelligent thinking people those are really positive traits and are actually strengths  it may also be that the people you are around arent on the same wavelength as you again theres nothing wrong with that  it just means that you might find conversation and socialising easier with people who are more on your level   social anxiety really sucks and whilst i still deal with it i have come a long way from those painfully awkward days in my past  it can get better i promise i cant really add much to what nikita has said   this unfortunately is common for social anxiety and its something i struggle with too  i have got much better than i was in the past but i feel like ive got a long way to go   ultimately whats helped me is being around people more but also being around people who are safe usually this means women and people who are older than myself  ive found particular activities are usually nurturing environments such as artcraft classes meditation groups just learning how to relax whilst being around people is good  it doesnt necessarily have to be anything too full on that requires lots of conversation   another book ive found helpful has been a woman in your own right  assertiveness and you i guess it deals more with being able to stand up for yourself and have healthy boundaries but its worth a read err i dont like the idea of slowly introducing my body to strangers but the invisibility sounds fantastic importantly people have different thresholds for perceiving responding to and becoming overwhelmed by sensations which are reflected in individuals lifestyles moods and temperaments individuals who are more socially anxious are thought to be innately more sensitive to sensory information increased levels of anxiety contribute to sensory overresponsiveness hypersensitive as arousal increases ones awareness of our surroundings and heightens the likeliness of responding to aversive stimuli           im really glad i found this article and thanks for sharing firemonkee   this is something i experience a lot  it sounds a bit like a catch22 situation though if youre anxious youre more sensitive to stimuli and the more sensitive you are to stimuli the more anxious you get  i suppose this is why escape routes and time to yourself to recharge is really important i can relate to what youre saying too  it is draining to have real life interactions and to deal with the anxiety that comes with that  i really like the idea of having company because im so alone a lot of the time but the reality of being around people is tough   i think its really good that youve got some good online connections and i think that thats better than nothing   i suppose i would say though is that i do think its important to have some social contact with people  even if its just one person for a short amount of time otherwise things could get worse in terms of anxiety levels   if you can find calm environments to be in thats a good place to start  years ago i used to attend reading groups at my local library i still go to some meditation classes and do pottery all of those activities are quiet and supportive perhaps its something to consider this is something i can relate to  i dont feel that in as a person in a more general sense i am lacking i do have good qualities   but i do feel that i lack that something that enables other people to be able to get on and socialise naturally   the childhood emotional neglect thing isnt something i can easily accept though  my parents were both very loving and supportive so i dont feel neglected by them   then again when i dig deep enough there were times when i felt a bit unrecognised and pushed out  by thats through no fault of my parents  it was because my siblings were being such a pain in the ass that they didnt have time for me i agree with purple in that yes social anxiety can include the things youve said  for me it feels like a big weight or a wall thats in front of me when im having a conversation or im part of a group a part of myself really wants to join in and its like im screaming at myself to loosen up and say something but the social anxiety makes me so tense its like swimming against the tide and yes it can lead to you feeling depressed  have you sought any help for this sort of thing whilst people have different views on what helps and some people dont always get on with medication i have found that taking citalopram has helped me massively in terms of social anxiety so is your fear around the fact that youve never snowboarded before  i am assuming your husband is aware that this is your first time trying it   its understandable to be a bit nervous about it all  but as im sure you may know the fear of doing something is often far worse than actually doing it   i bet that once you get the hang of it youll really enjoy yourself  i know thats not much of a consolation at this precise point in time   one technique ive read is to try and convinced yourself when you feel the physical feelings of fear or nervousness that you are in fact excited  the fearexcitement response in our bodies are pretty much identical  the only thing that makes one unbearable and the other more positive is the content of our thoughts  it may not work but i do think its worth a go i wouldnt say youre abnormal but it does sound like youre giving this a lot more thought than the average person would  as youve posted in the social anxiety section im guessing you are aware that you might have anxiety issues  it also sounds like maybe theres a bit of low selfesteem going on   have you ever had any therapy or maybe looked into selfhelp books that give techniques to help control your thoughts like cbt oh i can relate to this big time   i consider myself to be quite intuitive and have found my nonrational judgments in pas situations to be correct  having said that ive also wasted hours and hours worrying about something that never happened because i was convinced i was being given a sign    its really difficult and i dont think theres any way to know unless you actually do whatever it is thats provoking fear in you  i think the more you prove these intrusive thoughts wrong the better you can get at knowing the difference between the two   i tend to think also that if you know youre on a downer or are generally worrying then a bad thought is more likely to be a just a bad thought  for me its those times where im happy enough but have a sudden gut feeling that are more of the intuitive nature    thats just my opinion anyway am very interested to see other peoples thoughts on this im a bit too far away to attend this but am wishing you good luck in your venture and i hope that you find likeminded people to start so socialise with   also wanted to add that ive found meditationspiritual groups to be quite nonjudgemental and supportive too its helped me a lot from my late teens when i was extremely socially anxious to be involved in these kinds of activities i cant quite understand why its talking about attachment i was very secure in my attachment i was probably one of the only children at play school that didnt cry when their mum left them in the morning probably because i was very confident with children my own age my shyness around adults was terrible though to the point where i often looked to my mum to rescue me from a conversation so that i didnt have to talk  so yeah am not sure where i fit into the attachmentshyness thingy but it definitely makes sense to me that a shyer child is probably more likely to be anxious as a teen i think its very wise to have an escape plan   nothing wrong with saying you need to do some revision   or perhaps depending on what gifts you get you want to go and read your new booklisten to your new cdwhatever is appropriate   think its better that you try and then get away if you need to than hide away so is it tinnitus youre experiencing or is it more in your head if you understand what i mean its really unhelpful that they gp cant help they didnt suggest anything at all  i know it sounds a bit wacky and can understand if its not something youd consider but when i had bad tinnitus once i did some reflexology on myself and it worked i was amazed no reflexology is where there are believed to be certain points on your feet that can be massaged to help heal the body  the point for the ears i think are under just under the toes oh gosh im always doing this and always have done even from a really young age i spend more time living in my daydream world than the real world and it does feel like a chronic thing that i cant always control thanks for the information  its useful to know im not the only one either i wouldnt say i have agoraphobia but i feel im definitely restricted in terms of where i can go without suffering with anxiety some days i cant even make it to the high street i suppose im lucky because it does fluctuate and so some days are better and i feel more independent yes im often daydreaming my daydream world is very full for me its an escape and it also helps me process things sometimes  i agree with billfish that actually it can be  sign of creativity and could be channelled artistically  however i wonder if you feel its just daydreaming or whether its something else sometimes it can seem like im daydreaming but im actually zoning out i wont say i get to a full on dissociative state but i come very close to it this usually happens when im going through a bad time and im finding being fully present too difficult and painful  suppose what im asking is whether or not you think theres something more going on than just your average daydream welcome to the forum it may not be that you have social anxiety in its more typical form but it does sound like theres some struggles there i wish i had an easy answer i can relate to the general awkwardness and feeling like you want to talk but you just cant i can understand your anxiety im sure shell respect your privacy when you need to use the bathroom to wash or go to the loo how long are you staying for i dont shower daily and i dont know if i can speak for anyone else but i do presume that men dont tend to shower as often as women im not saying this to cause a row on here i just mean to reassure you that i wouldnt think it strange if someone didnt shower for a few days  though i do think if the hot weather continues a bath on the third day as in no wash for two days then wash on the third is generally accepted does she not have a shower then  just some advice with the number two situation i sometimes run a tap if im too selfconscious or pull the flush so that it creates some noise it eases my anxiety a bit  as for the pyjamas unless theyve got holes in then i wouldnt worry about putting underpants underneath though if you feel you want to just for you own peace of mind then im sure theres no harm in it  im sorry that youre dealing with this anxiety about the visit hopefully when youre there youll be able to relax and youll adjust x lmao nah living in a hippie town im pretty classy with my thirdday washing routine most people here just dowse themselves in patchouli oil to disguise the grime  i am pretty clean and i dont smell honest  x samesies to most people here  if i spot somebody that i know when im out somewhere i go out of my way to hide from them just so that i dont have to say hello to them i textemail more than i phone i cancel plans i dont have any friends or social life never had a proper boyfriend i only shop late at night in the 24 hour supermarket i breathe like a spazzo bulldog whenever im out because the anxiety and i also sweat a lot i analyse even the shortest and smallest of social exchanges i am still haunted by embarrassment for silly things i said from years ago  the list goes on x it sounds to me as if low selfesteem could possibly be at the route of you comparing yourself to others i think its really easy to see others as better probably now more than ever what with social media but it is an illusion honest im sure ive seen a quote that says something along the lines of dont compare your behind the scenes to somebody elses highlight reel i think its really important to keep in mind that people naturally only present the more appealing parts of themselves to others and you never can really know whats going on for someone at any given moment sometimes people are just better than others at giving off the impression that theyve got their life together and are really happy  as for what you wear i can honestly say that ive never looked at what a womans wearing and judged her perhaps when its cold outside and i see a girl wearing i short skirt i spare a thought for how bloody freezing she must be but i wouldnt consider someone a slut for what they wear or for that matter a prude you really must just find what you feel comfortable in and really work on understanding that people are probably not even taking any notice of your clothes  the thing is with anxiety is that it can make you feel as if the spotlight is on you and that everybody is looking at you making judgements etc but the truth is most people are so absorbed in their own thoughts and what theyre doing that they probably dont even notice you x for me it was the other way around i found that improving my social anxiety was what got rid of the psychosis i think the social anxiety has been the issue all along my psychotic thoughts seemed to be linked to my social fears  being watched being filmed having my thoughts broadcast all of these were stemming from my fear of being looked at and being noticed there was something about the fear of being exposed and observed which got out of control and turned into psychoticdelusional thinking  sorry if thats not quite the answer you were looking for just wanted to say that i really think in my case the two are closely linked x i see this is your first post  welcome to the forums  have you been diagnosed with any mental health issues  i think sometimes when youre struggling with your mental health the brain can get to overwhelmed and it switches off because its just too overwhelming to be feeling everything all the time  of course i dont know if thats a scientific or proven explanation its just the way i explain what happens to me  what im saying is sometimes feelings are so difficult to access it can feel like theyre not there at all and it can be quite worrying to think that you are void of any emotions   youve not shared much about your past or present circumstances but perhaps there are reasons why you cant readily feel your feelings x im glad to hear that you dont have a problem with this now that youre stable  thats really quite remarkable lineups arent so much an issue for me however i hate crowds my anxiety in crowds has never gone away no matter what ive tried i just see it as part of who i am rather than an illness i think i am too sensitive to be around to many people and so now i just avoid being in crowded places   out of curiosity would you say its the pills that have made a difference to you its interesting to know whats helped x i cant say for sure because its not the same for everybody i say yes you probably will feel some side effects again  for me nausea has always been the main side effect of citalopram ive been on 20mg 40mg and even 60mg and on each dose increase i found myself feeling sick all over again it does wear off though im currently taking 20mg which is the standard dose and i do find that citalopram has been the most effective antidepressant in terms of my social anxiety i hope you find it helpful too  fingers crossed for you x i do agree and would also add that outside experiences such as being bullied also contributes  its a bloody hard cycle to break though when it comes to staying in i suppose its all about going outside of your comfort zone and challenging yourself but i think youve got to have a certain amount of confidence to do that in the first place  x to be fair meds have helped me in terms of my social anxiety  once id taken citalopram for about a fortnight i was finding that i was naturally joining in conversations and wasnt overthinking everything  trouble is it hasnt helped me a great deal with other types of anxiety i get x yes  butterflies are definitely a part of any anxiety or phobia it also can wreak havoc with your digestive system sometimes it can go one of two ways either leaving you blocked or needing to go to the toilet more often apparently there are different remedies you can take to help with the toilet issue some herbal and others more conventional meds but i havent really found a way of getting rid of the butterflies x i do share your anxiety with going away from home  even if im still local if im not sleeping in my own bed and waking up in my own space i get really stressed out  i presume you will have your own room i think it may help you cope if you take some time to be by yourself for a while each day even if its just taking a short walk  if youre not used to being around people then i do think its natural to want some space   i wouldnt worry at all about her friends if they meet you the chances are they wont take much notice of you and wont judge you i know ive rarely taken much notice of friends parents   at the end of the day shes invited you to be there and so she wants your company quirks and all if she felt you were going to be worry or a burden in any way then im sure shed have found an excuse not to invite you x it may feel like an overreaction to you especially if you are not used to standing up for yourself but i think it would be wise to inform the police i dont know where you stand if you handed over the money willingly i use quotation marks because thats debatable seeing as you struggle with saying no however from what you say it sounds like this man is targeting vulnerable people for his own gain also as others have said he could potentially start harassing you big time and may even start to threaten you or worse   in the past and still now really its been hard for me to stand up for myself but easier to take action if i think some other person may be affected what im getting at is that by telling the police you may be able to prevent other vulnerable people from being exploited in a similar way  assertiveness is very difficult ive read a book called a woman in your own right  assertiveness and you and that has helped me i dont know if youre female or male but to be honest im not sure why the title of the book was so gender specific i thought the advice in it was beneficial to all it helped me because it included some thorough advice about saying no one particular thing i picked up was that you dont have to give a reason for saying no in fact the author practically discouraged you from doing so because by giving a reason it leaves you open to negotiation and being manipulated into changing your mind thats been a breakthrough for me  i often used to use any excuse to get out of situations like i dont have any money often someone would come back with ill lend you some and id be back to square one  it takes a lot of practise i am a chronic people pleaser but i do feel ive made progress in this area though still have some way to go i know its a bit of a cheesy quote but those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind you dont owe this person or anybody else to tries to take advantage of you anything x im hypersensitive too which leads to my social anxiety i dont think its something that will go away because its part of who you are the only thing that helps for me is to develop a more subjective way of seeing things deep inside i can be extremely hurt by something small but ive learned and am still learning to reason with my extremely sensitive self eg i say good morning to someone they give me a short response which i felt was unfriendly my sensitive side would be thinking that ive done something wrong they hate me etc but my reasoning would say perhaps theyre having a bad day maybe theyre tired they might have a headache and not be in the mood to chat   also for me the number one rule is to remember that not everybody thinks like you do i know it sounds obvious but countless times ive been so hurt by somebodys actions ive felt like i must be a really awful person for someone to treat me a certain way because id never do that to somebody well not everybody is as sensitiveempathetic what you might deem hurtful somebody else wont even be capable of considering it potentially upsetting its worked both ways too sometimes ive made a joke and immediately apologised after saying that i was so sorry and i didnt mean to be horrible pretty much every time the person has told me they werent even bothered and i could see they werent just trying to protect my feelings they genuinely didnt carefound it funny  its a tough world out there so take care just thought id put that in as someone that relates to what youre saying i can relate to every single item on that list  ill also add going shopping so much to get yourself wound up about  if i chose a normal checkout i worry that the store staff and everybody behind me are judging what im buying i worry about the small talk i worry when ive only got lots of change that the staff might find that irritating that people are waiting while im counting the pennies  its not very often at all ill look a cashier in the eye because im so wound up   selfservice isnt much better please wait for assistance  oh my god theyre going to think ive stolen something  x just wanted to say youre really brave for taking up the training and putting yourself out there  it may be possible that youre overthinking i dont need to tell you because im sure you already know but our brains can be torturous in making us relive embarrassing moments and making us feel like everybodys thinking unfavourable things about us  im sure things will get better in time as other people have said  dont be too hard on yourself v its early days and you have already done so well  x no dont stop going to class it sounds like your depressionanxiety is getting the better of you you must remember that these thoughts you are having are not a true reflection of how things are  im sure your teacher doesnt think any bad things about you at all its more like youre being hard on yourself are you managing to keep up with what youre being taught is this effecting your work x welcome to the forum   im sorry to hear of your struggles both past and present its quite clear that youre feeling really pressured and thats not helping matters at all    are you under the care of a mental health team it doesnt sound like you are in which case have you ever told your gp how you feel x sounds like a really stressful situation you could have done without to be fair you cannot be responsible for the actions of other people  even those closest to you you didnt do anything or write anything on facebook from what i gather and so it was a situation that blew up without you having a look in i can understand how you may feel betrayed by the people at work and angry about the situation as its affected your relationship  it may be that this situation at work is just going to take time to heal did you get an apology do you feel like the women involved are carrying the situation on or are being cold towards you in some way you dont have anything to feel awkward about and it should be those who were writing the stuff on your facebook that should be feeling awkward about it  if you like your job and have other friends there supporting you then you mustnt feel like you should leave x sounds like problems you can do without the bloke whos messing about with blocking you and whatnot obviously isnt really someone you can call a friend sounds a bit immature to be honest i dont know whether he iswas a long term friend but sometimes people just arent worth the hassle youve got to keep your chin up and walk away x tabbykitten is right tell them how you feel  are you already registered with a dentist or will you need to find a new one  either way when making the appointment explain your situation theyve always got a medical form to fill out i seem to need to do one every time i go so that will give them some idea of your health history   if a dentist and dental assistant knows that youre quite phobic of the experience theyre mostly quite understanding  they offer you numbing too so dont worry about things being too painful  i was actually quite amazed when i had a filling taken out to be replaced with a crown i honestly couldnt feel a thing because id had an injection which by the way wasnt bad  ive unwittingly bitten the inside of my mouth and its been more painful    really hope you can get this sorted soon x im sure this is something people can relate to even those people who dont really have particularly bad social anxiety   but sometimes my brain decides to torture me by replaying moments where ive said or done something really stupidembarrassingfoolish  its almost like a youve been framed montage god i hate that programme  of all the times ive made an utter tit out of myself and totally humiliated myself   obviously this is distressing enough but it just makes my social anxiety worse   i just think to myself god im such a cringey person and vow never to talk again to anyone in my whole life    does anyone else get this and if so have you found anything helps  i suppose i just need to find some affirmation or kind words that i can say to myself while all of this is going on in my mind because it really does make me want to never speak again x im sure you dont need me to tell you that alcohol is not going to help you at all   it may placate you in the shortterm but it could create bigger problems in the long run  alcohol is a depressant and so can affect your thinking so yeah i dont want to be bossy or tell you what to do because each of us have our own ways of dealing with things but just wanted to say that it might be causing you to feel much worse  im not sure how things work if you dont have health insurance would seeing a psychiatrist set you back a lot of money if its something you can afford to do then id suggest to you that you do it you talk of experiencing things which sound really distressing however im sure a good psychiatrist can assess you and help you  is your husband aware of the difficulties youre facing i know it can be really hard to explain and some thoughtsfeelings are just too intimate to share when youre depressed i just wonder if perhaps you could just say that youre feeling very stressed and dont know how to deal with things that he might show some understanding and offer support if he doesnt know somethings not quite right then he cant help x well done for spending time detoxing hope youre feeling a bit better because of it i hate crowds too  all that crap flying around in the atmosphere the claustrophobia the noise  no thank you  obviously having a panic attack is horrible for you but sitting by the side of the road can be quite a good thing if youre in a situation where you need to be in a crowded area for a while such as a wedding then taking time out for some airspace and then going back in can be helpful i always try to stay at the side of a room or in a corner rather than be in the centre of things having some water to sip helps me anxiety gives me a dry mouth so drinking water stops that also i find that by taking sips of water my breathing returns to a more reasonable level as a bonus in terms of social anxiety if things are awkward then having water in your mouth is a very good reason for not talking  deep breathing i know its a cliche but breathe deeply and slowly stretch out so that your muscles get a break from being all tensed up and really try to focus on feeling your feet on the ground  and always knowing where your exit is if you can sitstand with the exit in your sight even better not that anything bad is going to happen and youll need it  i just find it helpful to know where i can leave when i want to it can be quite empowering being by the door and not using it like youre the one in control not the anxiety x i can relate to this so youre not on your own with feeling this way angelinblack  sometimes it gets really bad ill be in a group of people and be totally zoned out thinking about selfharming i remember one particularly painful big family gathering where i was just sat there staring into thin air considering all the ways i might kill myself  it can be really stressful being around people even if nobodys being particularly unkind youve obviously got quite introvert tendencies so the trick is to take time out alone or sit to one side with just one other person who youre comfortable with thats presuming youre with familyfriends x ive always been a shy girl and during my teens it turned into social anxiety though thats not my first and foremost diagnosis its something which still affects me so youre not alone   im fine with some people with others i just cant stand to talk i have no idea why other than i dont want to say anything wrong or embarrass myself  i know this seems like a bit of a bogstandard response but have you talked to your doctor about it they could hopefully put you in touch with what might help  for me personally ive found that antidepressant have done and still do a lot for my social phobiafear of talking im still in control of what i say but i find that im talking more easily i dont sit in a group of people absolutely rigid and dreading being spoken to i feel much more relaxed comparing the periods of being without meds to how i am with them its a huge difference  it would be good if you could explore the reasons why you feel this way in therapy as i mentioned above my root is saying something wrong that will ultimately lead to me being rejected and alone although i can see how by not opening up to people im alone anyways so might as well take the risk  ultimately you do need to put yourself out there but i dont think its wise to jump in at the deep end try to get some useful tools ie meds therapy counselling etc that will help you cope and feel at least a little bit better about being around people im from the uk so i dont really understand about getting medical cover and things but how would you go about getting cover again while i agree that medication isnt a cure and that problems are still around when you take them i do think that they can help you manage the more severe episodes and manifestations of your illness for example crying hysterically and hyperventilating is absolutely no joy for you at all and you shouldnt have to be experiencing it without some form of help  are people staff at your college aware of your difficulties are there any student support services available to you hello this thread is a week old but i hope youre still around browsing the site to read my reply your question have you felt like this just made me go yes  there are certain things youve written that i could have written myself when i was 15 its actually quite uncanny to be blunt teenage years are fcking awful i dont want to sound like your mother and im not belittling what youre going through at all i just want you to know that it will get easier in a few years  im 23 and im still awkward sometimes still selfconscious and can still feel my face going a wonderful shade of magenta when i talk to people but this is only in certain situations and only when im having a bad day hallelujah its not every second of every day like it used to be  a lot of my problem was being more emotionally intelligent and more mature than people my age do you feel that perhaps other teens arent quite on your wavelength i have about a handful of people my own age that im friends with the rest are a lot older and i feel able to be myself around them perhaps you should think about what interests you have and see what groups there are in your area obviously youre busy with school but maybe when you leave and enter the bigger world youll have more time to explore and meet people more like you who will make you feel more at ease in their company because i think thats a key factor with social anxiety if youre with people who you feel would judge or mock you then its not going to help you at all if youre around supportive and accepting people then youll feel more able to come out of your shell  something that a psychologist told me to do that helped a lot was that i should build up a bank of positive social experiences in my mind hold onto memories of when i was relaxed confident and had a good time being sociable because if your bank is only full of those times where you messed up then youre not going to feel encouraged or inspired to get out there at all i could be wrong but i think a lot of people with social anxiety prefer to be around a certain gender more than another personally i find it hard around men too even if its not someone i find attractive i just find it hard to relate to them so i dont know what to say with reguards to the virgin thing im so pleased you said you were proud because theres no shame in it at all i think when you meet the right person and you tell them youre a virgin theyll be really supportive of that they wont expect you to be amazing so dont worry if hes the right man for you hell understand and youll get better with each time anyway  i can see how being isolated as a teen hasnt helped with your anxiety from the age of 12 onwards i had home tuition so i know how it can affect your anxiety levels  with reguards to your communication disorder i think its totally up to you if you tell people upon meeting them or not do you worry if you told people that they would judge you or do you think that it would make you feel easier knowing that they know personally id wait and see what the person is like if they seemed nice and nonjudgemental id tell them i find the more im putting myself under pressure so say the right thing the harder it is to speak so anything you can do that will relieve that pressure can only be good i agree with what sarahd has suggested   you may have some success if you have a conversation or you may not it depends on where shes at in terms of her perspective of things   i would talk to a doctor and seek advice from them if she isnt willing to speak to somebody herself   the thing is i have experienced exactly the same as her in the past and its really horrible to go through so even if you do end up speaking to somebody without her permission it really is being cruel to be kind she will be suffering and so if you can bring about something that can help to end that it will be for the best hello and welcome to the forum    what strikes me is that you have good insight into how these things seem to feed into each other  anxiety can make you feel physically unwell which in turn makes you more anxious and its a vicious circle  having that awareness feels to me like an important first step   have you considered talking to a gp about your anxiety they may be able to point you in the direction of some support   the other thing that might be worth considering is keeping a track of how youre feeling each day physically and mentally  there are lots of apps you can get on your phone that can help with this i personally use health mapper  it can be really helpful to look back and think ive had these physical feelings before and i ended up being fine it was anxiety making it worse   i have to keep doing it with chest pains i get the amount of times ive been convinced i was having a heart attack when it turned out to be anxiety   i still have to be very mindful even now when i get chest pains but having that past experience to look back on can be reassuring ive also had thoughts of killing my brother but thoughts are just thoughts  i dont truly want to murder anybody because any type of violence makes me sick to my stomach i cant handle witnessing any kind of abuse   its just the fantasy of no longer having him around and no longer having the stress that i find appealing but you can get that distance and peace without resorting to murder   when you move out yes cut him out of your life you dont ever have to talk to him again if thats what you choose  it can be empowering to take control of you life in that way personally cutting all ties is the best thing that way you dont get sucked into any more of the drama or risk getting involved in any arguments that will drag you down   also why on earth would you want to fuck up your own life just to get some kind of revenge think about how unhappy you would be for the rest of your life most certainly spending a large chunk of it in prison plus im sure other members of the family would have strong feelings about it and you could end up making yourself completely ostracised   i just wanted to say also that domestic abuse includes abuse among family members it does not just happen between partners  the definition includes family members too  i would suggest doing an internet search to just see what domestic abuse services there are in your area   dont let the bastard get you down for any longer than he already has x first of all im really sorry to hear about your experiences at your last house how awful it must have been for you   its understandable that you are a bit sensitive to things now as a result of the way you were treated  on the one hand it does sound like youre being hypersensitive   but on the other hand i think id be offended and upset if someone had imitated a giggle also if people were asking me about noises in my flat id find it quite intrusive   clearly there are issues with soundproofing i sincerely hope that the council do something about it because its not just you whos being affected by it   in the meantime a couple of practical things might help  do you wear earplugs to bed  also i spend a lot of time listening to music through headphones when i can hear my neighbour being really loud i just put the volume up it blocks out the sound and nobody can complain because its through headphones   im sorry i cant be more helpful perhaps someone else might be more in the know about what you can do you know those ice packs you use to put in picnic bags i have two smallish ones i got them out of the freezer and put them on the bottom of my feet with a sock on top to keep it in place it really seemed to help hello and welcome to the forum   youre definitely not alone here    ive read through your post and i agree with your therapist  you could really do with some selfcare and focusing your love on your own family rather than trying to take on too much of outside stuff   its definitely not easy and it takes a lot of practise   sometimes youll completely forget to look after yourself but thats ok  dont beat yourself up if youve beaten yourself up    im really sorry i dont have much in terms of advice im working on the selfcare thing a lot at the moment too and i also get anxiety so i can relate i think that fighting them can give them too much of your focus and that can reinforce the anxiety youre experiencing the more you tell yourself not to think about something or that youre thinking is wrong the more likely you are to think about it for instance if i tell you that you arent allowed to think about a pink giraffe the first thing that comes into your mind is going to be a pink giraffe  this probably sounds really weird but when i get intrusive thoughts that are distressing i say to myself i want to go to the beach somehow it snaps me out of that cycle of the intrusive thoughts overpowering me and instead i start to think about what kind of beach i want to go to does it have sand or pebbles how deep is the sea whats the weather like etc  i dont think watching porn with have an affect on your sexuality or that youll turn it doesnt work like that otherwise those fundamental christian idiots who try to convert people into being straight would be far more successful than they are   are you seeing anybody for your mental health at all i think that intrusive thoughts can be more of a problem the more anxious you are if you can get some help to lessen your anxiety you might find that they become less frequent i know this is really random but are the voices in the guided meditation annoying at all    ive got sleeping headphones too and struggle with insomnia so this might be really helpful   im just a bit picky about peoples voices this hot weather is making me feel really shit   i feel trapped like theres no escape from it and im stuck with it and its making me feel like i cant breathe and i dont know what to do thanks everyone for your replies    im sorry some of you are experiencing the same    its just making my anxiety go through the roof the second i dont feel like i have a choice about something it really winds me up and makes me want to escape    i might try a wet towel ive been putting cold water on my feet and wrists but i dont have much energy to keep going to the bathroom to do that   exfbu  i did manage to get my medication sorted thank you for remembering and asking me about it hello and welcome to the forum  im sorry youve not had a response yet   i think it may be due to the section youve posted in ill ask a moderator to move this as you might get more views if its somewhere else its tricky to know where to post because this is such a big forum   anyway in answer to your question about when these kinds of thoughts stop being natural and become paranoia i think its all to do with how they affect you  if youre getting very anxious and the thoughts are really gripping you id say its becoming a problem  if its a natural lowkey kind of thing its far easier to be reassured by checking the door once for instance and then being able to let the thought go   i dont think the doctors are there to tell you off if you have come off of medication its not their job to do that  do you feel like it would be a good idea to go back to a doctor and be seen again perhaps a different doctor this time who will be able to look at you with a fresh pair of eyes   whilst its really common for depression and anxiety to go hand in hand you can get one without the other so just because your mood isnt low it doesnt mean to say you arent suffering with anxiety i wonder if its the release of chemicalshormones oxytocin that helps is it specifically the sex or the general comfort of being close to someone  its interesting not something id be interested in at all  but i admire the sex worker whos speaking in the article  i think its great to have that healing intention what does this money mean to you im wondering if on a deeper level you have issues around security and safety  the money in your account could be like an outward symbol of being secure hence you are spending so much time checking and being very protective of it perhaps its also something you can control if maybe your dont feel control in other areas of your life  i could be completely wrong of course  its just from personal experience when my life is feeling really precarious and scary i suddenly get very focused on having enough moneyfoodmaterial things around me please dont think im being the health police  ive got plenty of bad habits   but i dont drink purely because of how awful alcohol makes me feel i know i get a lot of scary symptoms like palpitations and my heart doing weird things hey welcome to the forum  i agree with the points that naominash has made  its really vital to care for yourself on a basic level by getting enough sleep and food   i am wondering if perhaps youre experiencing post traumatic stress disorder im not a doctor or anything but it does sound that would be a disorder that is close to describing what youre experiencing  have you sought out any help from a counsellor or doctor it would be great if you had some help with getting through this because it sounds like its really impacting your life theres definitely no harm in getting checked out your doctor will be able to examine you and rule out any physical cause  personally i dont think it sounds like its anything too sinister  unfortunately anxiety can have huge affect on your body and it can sometimes even make people convinced theyre dying  it took me a long time to learn that my chest pains werent a heart attack its always down to stress and anxiety hello and welcome to the forum    it sounds like youve been through a lot but you  have also done a lot of work on yourself especially in admitting to yourself that youve kept a secret for so long   i dont want to sound patronising but that is really brave   are you getting any counselling to help you through what you are only now starting to get in touch with   i think it might be really helpful for you to have that space to talk about whatever you want without judgement and it might also help lessen your anxiety   i really feel for you because i know exactly what you mean   i am very selfconscious about what i say and to who because i have felt at times that i have overshared things that arent appropriate or embarrassed myself for talking a load of rubbish  its difficult because it then causes you to overthink about whether or not people are judging you which in turn just gives you more anxiety   my theory is that i spent a lot of my life being quite isolated and out of touch with myself and others  with what youre going through it makes me think it might be similar for you  youre only just discovering your real self which almost means learning to be you again   there are bound to be some bumps in the road when it comes to talking and socialising whilst youre growing as a person   i think the most important thing is to be compassionate towards yourself telling yourself youve said something wrong wont help at all i can relate to what youre experiencing definitely i also seem to need more sleep than the average person it makes me wonder if theres a connection somewhere  on the forum elsewhere i was only saying that i was considering one of those alarm clocks that wake you up more naturally with light  its not arrived yet but im hoping it will help me get past that feeling of panic when i wake up  im just wondering how your dreams are in general i get a lot of nightmares and i think that doesnt help weird thing is its not always big events that i get this with  sometimes it can be as little as knowing i have to go to the supermarket  before i open my door to leave my flat i always get those butterflies and shallow breaths    its helpful to find a term for it so thanks for sharing this link seems like ive just made a step in knowing what it is it might sound a bit wacky or out there but if you do have a fear of being attacked have you considered selfdefence classes it might not be your cup of tea and thats ok its just a thought  there are things you can legally do to ensure that you are safe when you go out and about  im wondering what kind of an area you live in its not that im trying to belittle your fears at all i just personally think there are different risks living in an urban vs living in a rural area   i used to fear going out on my own a lot but got a bit better by starting small  being somewhere very safe library reading groups helped me a lot it helped me slowly increase my confidence in being in public    it can and does get better though i used to only ever go to the supermarket with my parents and would freak out if they didnt stay in the same aisle as me i never thought that would change but my anxiety in that sense has got a lot better   its definitely doable i have borderline personality disorder and feeling like i was being watched was one of the first symptoms that i had i felt like i was being secretly filmed and my life was being shown on tv like the truman show  paranoia and transient psychosis is a known trait of bpd its really horrible to be feeling like this i know firsthand are you on any meds at the moment are you seeing a cpn or psychiatrist the impact of social isolation   social psychological and medical research has now demonstrated conclusively that there is a direct correlation between the degree to which a person feels connected to others and their physical and mental health   here are some of the most commonly known effects of not feeling a connection to others   generally decreased feeling of vitality less energy and feeling tired more often  greater likelihood of chronic illness such as heart disease cancer diabetes etc  more frequent bouts of sickness such as colds or flu and longer recovery times  longer recovery times from injury  regular feelings of loneliness  increased likelihood of depression  decreased level of happiness and satisfaction with life in general  shorter life spans   also on that link it says    feelings of social isolation are linked to alterations in the activity of genes that control inflammation the study provides a molecular framework for understanding why social factors are linked to an increased risk of heart disease viral infections and cancer  study by university of california   every time i have a blood test my inflammation markers are high and for no obvious reason thats really fascinating hello and welcome to the forum   i know what you mean about intrusive thoughts and the endless cycle of thinking about it not thinking about it thinking about not thinking about it   i hope you find the forum helpful and feel less alone knowing that other people experience the same sort of thing not sure how old your boyfriend and friends are clouds  but when i was younger and got about with girls my own age 20 at that time they were really rubbish at offering any kind of support or empathy   id say i needed some company because i was down but when i met up with them i couldnt get a word in edgeways it felt hugely disappointing   it could be a lack of maturity or a lack of knowledge or skill when it comes to dealing with other peoples emotions   do you get understanding when youre unwell in physical ways are the people in your life generally supportive in other ways   perhaps it might be worth explaining what you like or need when you confide in people even if you tell them its fine if they dont know what to say to you all you want is a sympathetic ear   theres a big difference between pretending nothings been said and saying listen im really crap at dealing with emotional stuff but if theres anything i can do to help you feel better then let me know i really feel for you on this one  its something i used to suffer with terribly i am better now than i was but ive still got a way to go until im satisfied with my level of confidence  its all a very horrible selfconscious cycle isnt it    the trouble is when it comes to things like eye contact and looking the more anxious you are the more likely people are to look at you strangely and so it becomes a bit of a selffulfilling prophecy   i remember going out one day and i felt like people were giving me really weird looks it wasnt until i sat down and a lady asked me if i was ok because i looked terrified that i realised why i was getting stared at   having said all of this people rarely pay that much attention to anybody else even more so in the last couple of years now that everybody is addicted to their mobile phone   i would say that as its now getting to a point where youre avoiding going to lectures and going out its probably wise that you seek out some help with this  as previously suggested your uni more than likely has services that can help you out and from what i hear some universities are very good at helping you out on a more practical level too  not sure how far away you are from home or if you have a local walkin centre but it might be a good idea to see a gp too   i very much agree with chris in that this is definitely something you can get through and it will get better   just to add that i improved with the help of an ssri medication and going to places that were supportive and nurturing like meditation groups or library groups  i found it much easier to improve my confidence around people if i knew i was going into an environment where it would be quiet and accepting ive absolutely no idea what same is and thats after a google search is it sold as a supplement in a tablet form do you buy it legitimately  if somethings not working then i dont know if there is a lot you can do to make it work better i know people talk of hacks involving taking various things alongside other meds or supplements which im not going to list in case anybody gets any ideas but its all very risky especially if there hasnt been any proper research into the effects  i can really appreciate that you might not want to go for more conventional medicine because thats not for everyone but have you tried any other prescribed meds apart from venlaflaxine  personally i had a very hard time on venlaflaxine at stopped taking it within a week because it was too much to bear but ive had more luck with citalopram and its helped me a lot  if you are looking into something more alternative have you tried the standard sort of herbs like lavender chamomile valerian etc i know certain pharmacies and chemists have herbal supplements for anxiety  just a comment on the misty hazy not really there feeling  ive found that some meds can make depersonalisationderealisation much worse which in turn has created more anxiety its something to be aware of sometimes its pleasant to feel a bit floaty but other times its made me really panic reading your post is enough to make somebody really despise humanity  im not saying that to make you feel bad im just incredibly sorry to hear about your downright cruel and upsetting experiences  yes you were racially abused and no you are not being paranoid   the way you were treated is absolutely disgusting and if you had gone to the police i seriously think that the people involved in such hated and abuse should have been arrested  do not doubt yourself for one second their behaviour was unaccepted   so am i reading your weight right are you 95lbs or did you forget to add a 1 before that im sorry im just a bit confused because if you are 95lbs you would according to the bmi which isnt always accurate but still be considered underweight   not that it matters either way it sounds to me as if you were a target and the things that were said to you were not based on truth but said so that the bullies could get a sick sense of power and a cheap laugh  i do think that abusive people can sense a vulnerable person which may be why other people who might have been a bit more odd than you were accepted and you werent  sometimes people can just sense a different energy and attack what they dont understand  i wonder if actually you werent more graceful more gentle and kinder than other people and thats what the bullies didnt like   being quite pale white myself i cant pretend to know how it feels to want to lighten your skin and so im sorry in that sense that i cant truly understand  but i do wish that you were told as a teen that you were beautiful and that you absolutely did not need to do that to yourself from what i understand it can be quite dangerous and so im really glad you no longer do this    do you think your mum is beautiful do you think your cousins are beautiful  sometimes its easier to see beauty in other people than it is ourselves but if you can acknowledge their beauty it might help in terms of coming to accept yourself   ultimately i do think you are at the beginning of a journey of selfacceptance and that can be really hard  you must remember that other peoples comments about your appearance are pure ignorance and it really reflects how ugly they are as people if they feel the entitlement to put a stranger down  beauty really is only skin deep and it doesnt last forever people age and they change   innerbeauty and a good heart lasts a lifetime   how do you feel about yourself as a person not thinking about how you look  i mean who you are  i think one of the things that helped me get over my physical selfloathing was the realisation that im a good person and the world needs good people now more than ever yes i get the same feeling i also get it when on the rare occasion that i exercise and get short of breath so at least for myself i know its not necessarily a bad thing ive found keeping hydrated can help though drinking water whilst youve got the sore throat feeling does make me feel worse thank goodness for that  they dragged the whole thing out for long enough didnt they    and yes stay out of trouble but im glad that its all over now must be a huge relief its actually been a long time since i first spoke to my gp about my mental health issues and as i was a young person at the time i got a referral to the child and adolescent mental health services really quickly so i dont really know how things go if somebody visits a doctor as an adult however i do just want to really encourage you to seek help and say that as scary as it might seem it will hopefully be worth it because it sounds like youve been struggling on your own for too long hi and welcome to the forum   i have a lot of pain in my body and do suspect i have fibromyalgia though ive continually seen my doctor for how i feel and its not even been mentioned  perhaps i should just say i think its something ive got but dont want to come across as one of those annoying patients that selfdiagnoses through the internet    it may be that i dont have fibro though  i do think anxiety and ptsd type symptoms cause the body an incredible amount of stress and that can manifest in pain and aching  i also experience lots of types of pain  from random jolting to dull aching   i just take painkillers when i really need them and try not to overuse them because that makes them less effective  a hot water bottle and comfortable clothing nothing too tight really helps   finally i dont know how your sleeping is but i have nightmares and a lot of anxiety around bedtime if youre not sleeping well then that can have a massive effect on pain and aching    i really hope you can get sorted and start to feel better soon it sounds like youve been through a lot im sorry that youre going through this katya   dont know if its much of a consolation but what you wrote describes how i feel quite often and im still living to tell the tale so while it feels really serious try not to panic because it probably is just awful anxiety   i think getting a doctors note tomorrow and perhaps getting hold of some valium at the same time if thats possible might be the best idea for now   just a few tips  i find a cold glass of water helps me feel better and can regulate my breathing   splashing a bit of cold water on my face helps too if i cant snap out of very shallow or missed breathing  dont wear a bra whenever possible not sure about you but im pretty busty and having a bra literally restricting my chest doesnt help at all  open a windowfresh air   also is it possible that you might have pulled a muscle in your chest just a random thought but sometimes when i think about it sometimes i can recall straining maybe through coughingvommingsneezing   i really hope you feel better soon im sorry if by reminding you about tomorrow is not welcome in this thread and youre trying to distract yourself but i do want to wish you the best and say good luck im glad to hear that a short film has been made and there is a campaign for greater awareness i dont know but i imagine it must be really difficult to have bdd  not just because of all of the unrealistic images of beauty that we are bombarded with but because sadly being unhappy with your appearance is very common i hope that this will make people think twice about saying things like oh everybody is insecure about their appearance i feel for you  anxiety and panic is awful and it can get really unbearable not that i think there is any reason for you to worry but i agree that perhaps talking to your doctor about this might be a good idea  as i said im sure these feelings are down to anxiety but its best to get an overall check of your blood pressure and stuff just to be on the safe side i hope you feel better soon and get some good rest tonight x welcome to the forum  medication and therapy obviously do have their benefits but nothing beats actually facing your fears headon social anxiety really sucks but ive only really made serious improvements since i got out and met new people  there are some less scary environments to be in that others if i were you when youre ready id start off by getting out to somewhere that isnt too high pressured poetry cafes were a godsend to me when i was starting to get out more they were held in the evening in a poorly lit cafe there was no conversation only listening to someone read so i was among people with no pressure to talk  ideal this court case thing has been going on a long time hasnt it must be really driving you around the bend i hope that it can finally be sorted in three weeks time and i hope that youre right in thinking that youll get a positive outcome it takes the mickey that youve had to wait so long really my inner child would love to be friends with your innerchild she doesnt have to talk if she doesnt want to  we can just play side by side    i have similar feelings around my innerchild too i was a very shy child  also some days i dont feel the 25 years old that i actually am i feel like im 5 years old again its highly unlikely but not impossible that you could get serotonin sydrome from the prozac you are taking im sorry if thats not the most reassuring of answers but i wanted to be realistic though i would remind you that it is extremely rare   sometimes i get very caught up in philosophical wondering its very hard to articulate precisely what goes on in my mind but its almost as if i can see the architecturestructure of reality and i see how flimsy it really is also this reality seems very linear and i believe that things arent really that linear  that there are layers and layers and layers to the great mystery of life and the universe that probably doesnt make much sense   anyway it sounds to me like you have a very intelligent mind and im wondering if having something really academic to get your teeth into might be a good thing i think that if youre bright and your mind isnt stimulated it can easily turn in on itself and cause these very sorts of issues with overthinking and so even if its just puzzle solving like crosswords in newspapers perhaps that would put your intelligence to use and at least temporarily relieve this anxiety it may not be that your friend is deliberately hiding things from you  it could just be that she doesnt see the activities she does with this other friend as significant also you mention that she says she doesnt really like this person i wonder if shes too polite to tell her welcome to the forum    how long have you been on your medication for sometimes it takes a while for it to kick in also it can take you trying out several medications before you find one that works for you   what do you do during the day i wonder how structured your day is and if working on a routine might help  have you noticed anything in particular that triggers your anxiety   it sounds to me like you are really doing some good things in terms of walking and breathing exercises so it must be frustrating for you not to be feeling much different   being creative is something i find helps me feel a bit better  even if its doing colouring in you can find loads of good adult colouringin books online my whole mind gets absorbed in what im doing and so the anxiety temporarily goes away   im not sure how able you are to concentrate but activities like crosswords and the like also help me too welcome to the forum   did anything in particular start this fear or has it seemingly come out of the blue i appreciate that you said youve been getting anxiety since last summer but im wondering if a specific event might have triggered something  for instance a bereavementillnesstraumatic event  have you sought professional help at all the reason i ask is that im wondering if your overall anxiety level was reduced it might help ease your fear around sleep  im not sure if youve looked around the forum yet but in the specific phobias subsection there are several threads from members who have a fear of sleeping the particular threads and members dont appear to be active recently but it may be helpful for you to look through some of those threads  personally i dont really fear sleep itself but i do have massive issues around safety when i go to bed i cannot sleep anywhere other than my own flat i have to have a light on i have to have a fan blowing on my face i have to wear earplugs i have to have the blind down in my window  unless i have these things i wont sleep but all of this stems from a fear of being attacked while im asleep rather than actually being asleep if that makes sense  nonetheless i am wondering if youve found any practical things help you feel more relaxed at bedtime i think that there is only so much one person can do as frustrating as that can be when it comes to someone we care about i think encouraging her to seek help and letting her know you are there for her if she needs support is the best thing hello and welcome to the forum it sounds as though you have been really kind to your friend and given her some much needed support and so i can understand how upsetting it must feel to have her turn on you particularly when youve done nothing wrong  the fact that she waited to confront you and spent the evening acting as though nothing was wrong is a bit odd  have you talked to her about how it made you feel when she accused you of saying something unkind i suppose it might be difficult though particularly if youre correct and she is having hallucinations  years ago i had a friend who made accusations about me that were untrue and it was down to her insecurity shed make these things up just for me to reassure her that i liked her and we were still friends i wonder if shes not hearing voices if this might be what shes doing  without knowing her or hearing her version of events its hard to know whats going on in her mind and i can only really speculate is she getting any professional help at all  it may be that this is a symptom of her being unwell and whilst its difficult you mustnt take it personally i think that perhaps you are right whilst it might be upsetting for you friendship to end ultimately you have to look after yourself youve been very caring and loyal to her unfortunately her illness is affecting her thinking and way of relating to other people so its important to know its not personal either way hey its nice to see you popping back in im sorry that suicidal have come back and the reckless behaviour is not good  when you say that the suicidal thoughts have returned does that mean that initially the citalopram helped and they went away  as for the increase in dose its pretty much the same sort of timing of when you start a med you should notice an effect in a few weeks reckless behaviour might make you feel better but im guessing its only temporary  i dont think you should go on a booze and drugs bender because you could end up really doing yourself damage or getting in trouble i understand that might not be of great concern to you given that youre feeling suicidal but you might not feel suicidal forever    ten years down the line you might have a really happy fulfilling life and youll look back and think i wish i  didnt take those risks  did you try counselling at all i think i can vaguely remember you saying you tried but it was rubbish so you decided not to go ahead with it the reason i ask is because medication only does so much  if there are circumstances in your life making you depressed you can pop as many pills as you like but until certain issues are addressed you wont feel better for long is there anything in particular in your life that you think might be exasperating your suicidal feelings x its a pity you dont have access to help   is it that they dont have services like cbt in your area or have you just not been offered it   have you thought about getting selfhelp books i know there are so many out there that its hard to know which are worth the time and money but there are books that are particularly recommended  when i was part of a selfesteem cbt group the facilitators suggested that we read overcoming low selfesteem and it did really help me   as somebody who was bullied in secondary school but took college courses i can definitely understand your fears about being in that kind of environment again  but there are ways to cope   for instance i made sure i left classes a bit early or arrived a bit late in order to avoid the rush of people around the college who were finding their way to their next class  i also made sure that i went somewhere quiet or completely off campus during lunchtimes so that i wouldnt be disturbed   if colleges or universities know you have certain issues with anxiety in my experience they are generally quite accommodating and will do what they can to support you   of course ideally you wont need that support and youll be fine without it but it is there if you were to need it   finally i agree with melandcj and i think you have plenty to be proud of  youre strong adventurous ambitions sensitive  those are wonderful traits and innerbeauty like that never fades or grows wrinkly aww im sure thats not true dreamer sometimes when were isolated it can certainly feel like nobody cares but other peoples lives can be very busy its not so much that they dont care or dont want to see you its mostly that people cant find the time  your therapists reaction to you mentioning this wasnt very helpful im surprised that they didnt explore this more with you i hope youre not too disappointed that the therapist didnt seem to listen you could always bring it up again next time and say that you found their previous response unhelpful though i guess that could be quite anxiety inducing  i really relate to your fears around this though i often find myself in a similar position where ive not spoken to anybody for days and it occurs to me that i could be lying dead for all anybody else knows and yeah its upsetting  i do think keeping busy is key  and trying to make new acquaintances so that perhaps you have more of an active social life and that might help lessen this anxiety a bit its really good that you found a group and as long as you dont completely wear yourself out i think its a good idea to perhaps look out for some more things to do  my only other comment is that i talk to my mum mostly every night unless im out or having a nap that it something that helps me feel more assured that someone would come looking for me if i didnt speak to them i know that sounds a bit depressing but i hope you know what i mean is there anybody you could speak to on the phone regularly hi and welcome to the forum what you describe does sound like anxiety  have you experienced this in the past or has this been since your deli closed im sorry to hear that you had to close it due to slow business by the way  can you identify if there is anything in particular that you are scared of when you go out  for example are you worried that someone you know might see you and want to talk to you  it sounds as though going from being very busy to spending a lot of time in your apartment may be making the situation worse sometimes it can be difficult to keep our minds healthy if we dont have something to focus on are there any activities that you would feel able to do that would help keep your mind occupied and build your confidence back up again it could be something simple like going swimming or visiting the library hiya im sorry youre struggling with withdrawal  it can feel really awful  are you reducing your medication as advised by a doctor im just checking because its important to follow correct instructions when coming off of a medication  as for the nausea it generally depends on what works for you some people like myself find that antinausea pills actually make nausea worse  its a good idea to make sure you are drinking enough water and stay hydrated make sure you eat enough  sometimes eating lighter meals more often makes peoples stomach more settled that three main meals a day  also ginger is known for having antinausea properties not sure if you like the taste of ginger but drinking ginger teabeer or eating some ginger biscuits might help  i hope that you start to feel better soon im glad you had counselling today but i agree that perhaps you should change doctors  its essential that they are there to get back to you when you need them particularly if youre having a rough time of things with the withdrawal and nausea   whilst they might not necessarily be able to give you any specific advice have you tried talking to a pharmacist about overthecounter antinausea remedies   i mean youd have to fill them in on whats going on with the lexapro and klonapin  that way they wont give you anything that could make things worse  but it might be an idea if youre really struggling this doesnt surprise me ive always felt that the benefits of antidepressants for anxiety have been slightly exaggerated whilst they have helped me in terms of social anxiety because i feel less inhibited when i take them i still get very anxious and im supposedly on an ssri that helps with anxiety citalopram  i dont really know what the answer is  obviously we cant all we walking around on benzodiazepines but for people who want to take medication i wish there were something a bit better for anxiety out there speaking from personal experience yes  lack of sleep makes my palpitations much more intense and much more frightening   i agree with nikkita that it would be a good idea to see your doctor and have an ecg just to check that theres no underlying problems its more than likely that what youre experiencing is anxiety related and nothing sinister but i really think its better to get checked over im sorry youve not had a response yet saf75  have you talked to a doctor about how you feel and how difficult it is for you to find the motivation to go out and about  it sounds like your days are very lonely and that in itself can make you feel very low   do you think that if you felt a bit better and were able to go out more it might make your life feel more meaningful   it must have been really painful to lose friends and family particularly as its left you so isolated and so i understand how tempting it must be to push your remaining friend away as means of protecting yourself and her  but it sounds as though she has really stuck by you through a lot and cares for you a lot and so i really think you should make sure you keep that connection going hey thanks for the recommendations  i find all of those things you listed help me too though its not always easy for me to find the motivation to exercise  having said that when i do exercise i love to swim though i tend to go to the ladies only session due to being selfconscious in a swimming costume   i find breathing techniques help too and i also recommend nature noises my personal favourite is my ocean waves and windchime track   interestingly ive found some tracks on youtube that are binaural beats and music layered on top of one another which are quite calming to listen to mind you i have to be a bit careful because it sometimes makes me feel like im floating away i do think that this is a fairly common thing for people not that that makes it any more comfortable for you   it does sound like you probably have an anxiety issue around it though particularly as this is something you say youre dwelling on quite a bit    i suppose if you dont have any religious or spiritual beliefs then the concept of death must be more difficult to accept   personally believing what i do and having the experiences that ive had has really helped me in this sense   the process of dying itself unless youre very unfortunate is not necessarily a painful thing a lot of people just pass quietly in their sleep or in some way unaware of whats happening and when youre gone well youre just gone arent you   have you shared your thoughtsfeelings around this with any professionals x i cant say ive had any experience of antibiotics triggering depersonalisation but thats not to say that it hasnt had that effect on you  i do wonder if it was maybe the sleep deprivation and im also wondering if the sinus infection has completely cleared up now personally ive found my sinuses can really impact my feelings of depersonalisation and derealisation if theyre blocked up or inflammed it makes me feel like im wearing a mask under my skin if that makes sense  i do think youre doing the right things  getting better sleep improving your diet exercising and supplements etc sometimes it can take a while before the body fully recovers especially if youve been really run down  i hope things improve for you soon if they dont it may be worth talking to your doctor about it all hiya stace  you said that things changed after a trip that meant youd spent 6 hours in a car  is that right  did anything else happen to change your feelings like an accident or anything   it seems like quite a change in behaviour and there doesnt seem to be an obvious trigger for it    i used to get lots of anxiety about travelling by car but to be honest my anxiety levels overall were high so it was really just one manifestation of how bad things were overall   do you find you are anxious in general too or is it very specific to travelling in a car how come youre being made to do this and you dont have a choice   whilst i think that pushing yourself sometimes to be out there in the world can help i do think it needs to be done in a way thats realistic and isnt going to be too overwhelming   i think blueflames suggestion of talking to your tutor and seeking out student support services is a really good idea   if staff are aware of your struggles things can be put in place to help you   sometimes there are quiet spaces or counselling services that colleges have that can be used if you feel like you just need some space and time for yourself coincidently ive recently read an article talking about the nocebo effect and it seems that it is as real as the placebo effect  if you believe something is causing you harm then sometimes that harm can manifest itself physically   but i do think the key is that it really depends on how much you believe it   i suppose its more difficult for you because this is happening in a dream where you arent consciously in control of what you are seeing    i dont think there is a lot a doctor could do i think that being medical professionals they are quite likely to take the stance that it cant hurt you and so you might need to be prepared for that   im wondering if you have any beliefs in things that might counteract what goes on in your dream  for instance i am a believer in healing crystals and so i keep an amethyst next to my bed because its believed to have properties of psychic protection  now i know that sort of thing isnt for everyone but it might be something to explore   also has anything in particular changed or been stressing you out in your waking life  unfortunately nightmares seem to happen more when were stressed out  which just doesnt seem fair because those are the times that we could do with a more restful sleep it sounds like youre really struggling with both your mental and physical health  its tough enough to deal with one of those but when youre feeling unwell in body and mind its really draining isnt it    do you feel like you are honest with your nurse im not doubting you at all i suppose it seems like its a strange thing for her to say when youre still feeling so low  being alive is not the same as living your life and as a nurse she should know that   i think the fact that the pills helped initially but dont work so well now shows that you would probably benefit from other approaches  have you asked your nurse about getting a referral to talking therapies   i dont know what there is on offer where you live but some mental health teams offer emotional skills type courses these arent really focused on talking about your problems they are intended to teach you some skills to help you cope better   the thing is if you wait for something else to be offered you could be waiting a long time  it is generally best to try and be assertive and ask for what you need so if you can be brave and have a conversation with your nurse it may well turn out that you would be able to get some more support oh jimny   to be phoned at lets face it such an unsociable hour and be drawn into such a negative experience is stressful enough and thats without adding on the fact that you could potentially get into trouble   im really sorry that you were disrespected and it sounds she may have taken advantage of the fact that you are a kind person who would help someone   i hope that the police see sense when they see you tomorrow and you dont get any more trouble  look after yourself in the meantime and remember that the forum is here if you need to  let off some steam or you need some support im sorry to hear that it sounds like people were very rude and unwelcoming so i can see why you dont want to try again deal with it what kind of advice is that    have you considered going to your gp and explaining that youve been given these diagnoses but dont feel youve been given enough information or support for them   i understand that things might not be so straightforward for you given that you had a brain injury but i think its appalling that you were told to simply deal with it without being given any guidance on how to deal with it i think both genders are affected and there are unique pressures for everybody i dont think you can really say who is affected more also i dont know if its helpful to say any particular gender has a more difficult time than others it could create a division which is never going to lead to any open or supportive interactions between genders i hope that makes sense it sounds like the anxiety in these situations are quite severe   the feelings and physical sensations you describe sound quite debilitating so it must be really difficult for you   does your wife know how bad you feel when she doesnt respond for a while have you asked her if she can type a quick message to say she wont be able to reply for a short while to reassure you   i suppose im wondering also why you im her while youre at work   in the kindest way it isnt something that people generally do either because theyre not allowed or they get too busy   did you set up the iming so that you could be reassured while youre at work    do you think youd cope if you didnt im her during your working hours and instead maybe called her during your lunch break for example   the thing is whilst i understand you find talking to her comforting i dont know if its not doing you more harm than good to be doing it during work hours  it possibly affects your concentration its definitely causing you anxiety and it may be that its not easy for her to be keeping up the conversation  i know that even with people im very close to i run out of things to say oh right  now that youve shared that it really puts your first post in context   im sorry to hear of both your own struggles and her struggles  sounds like shes had some very frightening experiences and so its understandable really that you would be concerned   sometimes i get a similar thing but its with my parents sometimes if i dont hear from them ill automatically think something bad has happened  what helps me in that situation is to look at the situations in the past where ive panicked  in none of those situations did anything bad actually happen your fears about her havent been proved right   i wonder if perhaps thats something that might help you you could even have a little mantra that you could say to yourself like my worst case scenario has never happened or my worry is unnecessary  all is well i think that mental health issues can wreak havoc with your natural flow of emotions   depression can cause you to feel numb and unable to process emotions which can at times make you feel a bit cold   other times it only takes something very little for the floodgates to open up and for a long crying spell to come  so whilst i appreciate that youve been struggling with anxiety and low mood this sense you have that youve lost some emotional ability is something thats quite common for people to get when they experience depression and anxiety   have you spoken to a doctor about these feelings or thought about seeking out counselling i think its a good idea to email your therapist and say you need to keep your next appointment  im sorry youre feeling to overwhelmed with things at the moment chick  with regards to the exams you can only do your best you may be surprised at just how well you do  it seems like youre thinking about a lot of what ifs and worrying about the future    i guess when i feel very overwhelmed with anxiety i focus on just one week at a time and if i find myself worrying about something thats not happening this week i distract myself with something else it might be worth trying something like that having a this week only rule for yourself yes i think id agree with you there and say that the feelings you have are down to anxiety it doesnt sound very nice to be living with at all so i hope the appointment with the psychiatrist went ok and you got some help hello and welcome to the forum   i have to say that at 20 it would be more surprising if you did know exactly what direction you want your life to head in especially careerwise im 25 and only have a vague idea that maybe id like to help people in some way maybe through counselling  ive had conversations with older people say in their forties and fifties and they tell me even they dont know what they want to do for a job they end up getting into whatever work theyre doing by chance and stay with it because theyre not sure what else theyd like to do  i guess what im saying is try not to put so much pressure on yourself to have everything sorted because realistically people spend their whole lives finding out who they are and what they want  i really understand how you feel in terms of looking into different careers but having anxiety hold you back for me i think what if i commit to that career and end up hating it i cant stand the thought that i wouldnt be able to cope now presuming you live at home and dont have too many bills to pay i would advise you to take advantage of college courses as much as you can you can never be too educated  when i was 20 i did an environmental conservation course ive since completed body massage im currently studying astrology and i do pottery all of those are quite different but having that experience of dipping my toe in through a course has helped me decide whats for me and whats not  it does sound a bit like your anxiety can get quite carried away  the example you gave about making someone worse if you were a physiotherapist  so i wonder if youve considered talking to your gp or if youve ever got help for you anxiety  another thing that helped me get out of my anxiety was to go out to places on my own id take a camera with me made me feel less selfconscious for being by myself and by taking pictures it made me stop and appreciate whats around me and go for a walk or visit a national trust property  so if you can find a relaxed activity to do that might interest you in an environment thats not too chaotic it might help build your confidence a bit ive definitely experienced the angry feelings and the numbness but it was more depression related  though i guess anxiety and other mental health issues manifest differently in each individual   i just saw that you said you see a therapist and wanted to say yes  this is precisely the thing you should bring up with your therapist so you get hopefully get some more insight into hello and welcome to the forum   your post does make sense and youve come to the right place to vent as jimny said   can i ask what made you stop the online dating i think that you were very brave to try it and whilst i understand the reasons for joining a dating site are to hopefully get into a relationship i think the experiences you had were still valuable in some way   im sorry to hear about the job situation do you think that when you were made redundant that was when the anxiety came back   i suppose just from my own experiences of being chronically single its important to want a relationship for the right reasons and not see it as filling a void  right now im working on building a life that makes me feel content and whole while im single  that way i dont put so much importance or weight on a romantic partnership  there are lots of fulfilling experiences to had that dont involve having a partner so whilst it might get on your nerves and sound a bit of a cliche when your friends tell you to live your life for yourself i do think its an important point yeah supermarkets can be awful i usually go at a time when i know it wont be too busy  but yeah i agree with what youre saying cally if youre nearly there its always worth giving yourself that extra push to do whatever it is youre setting out to do hi and welcome to the forum  can i ask what you have in mind when you ask for a healing partner its not something ive heard before i presume its someone who you could go on a bit of a journey with to stop the trichotillomania i might attempt pancakes later fingers crossed theyll turn out ok i think it depends on what youre capable of doing  what i mean is a film can sometimes be good but other times i feel like i cant concentrate for the full duration of a film so its not a good idea to start watching one   my usual thing is to play free word games online its pretty good because it takes up your concentration and so your mind cant wander elsewhere  i like to go on pinterest too look at cutefunnyinspirational pictures  if im feeling lonely ill put the radio on so it feels like ive got some form of company   hope you find something that helps you anyway its a good decision to try and distract yourself  better to try and nip things in the bud than deal with a disaster welcome to the forum    im really sorry to hear that things are so difficult for you  you havent said where youve moved to but im guessing with needing insurance it might be the usa   im not entirely sure how things work out there but i hope your insurance gets approved soon because it sounds like you really could do with some support   the stuff with regards to your father is awful whilst i know that historical abuse cases carry lighter sentences i didnt know that victims could be treated so badly by not having their case brought to court at all that must feel pretty rubbish to be honest   did you find the counsellor youve been in the past year helpful at all  sometimes the counselling approach can be more helpful to people than therapy or at least thats the case for me  therapists seem to have an agenda whereas a counsellor is there to just listen   it may be that this time youll be able to find a more helpful doctor if medication hasnt helped you i guess youre not willing to really try any more   im just wondering if youre tried other things that might help  meditation setting small goals to achieve each day selfhelp books etc hey sev sounds like things are getting to a really bad point for you    when you say you think about suicide sometimes do you think youd ever act on it  if you ever feel like you might id suggest talking to a gp before doing anything to harm yourself   i know its tough and can feel a bit hopeless but things can change   whilst some people are against medication i have to say taking meds has really helped me in terms of my social anxiety i still get anxious yes but im able to actually have a conversation now and i dont feel so awful when im meeting someone new or find myself in a group of people  what im saying is it might be worth a try   i completely understand how upsetting the birthday thing can be when i was younger and had my more special birthdays 16 18 21 i think i cried on all of those occasions because i felt so alone and didnt have any friends to celebrate with  im 25 now i dont get as upset as i used to when its my birthday i suppose ive learned to relax about it a bit more and accept that my life hasnt been straightforward the fact i dont necessarily have friends to go out with is because of my anxiety and not that im not good enough in any way   anyway i can understand your reluctance but i would say that medication is something you might want to consider  also im wondering if you were offered any counselling at all sometimes that can be really helpful and help you in the longer term well obviously i wish youd stick around but look after yourself please  were not going anywhere if you change your mind and wanna come back im sorry to hear that people in your class are being unfriendly towards you   do you think they have already formed cliques and so its harder for you to make new friendships i wonder if their behaviour is more to do with them that it is a dislike for you not that im trying to invalidate you   i totally get that explaining your mental health issues is something that feels exposing but i dont think your making an excuse for yourself neither do i believe anybody else would think that  whilst i can appreciate the need to get on and live a regular life you do have to understand that mental health isnt something you choose so dont be too hard on yourself about it   i do think it would really help you to talk to someone at your college about it i bet you knew i was going to say that    that way you can access whatever services they have and you can have someone there to help you with this upcoming trip abroad   as for the trip itself its an incredibly courageous thing to do i think that in that situation it would be sink or swim  it could actually be really positive you might surprise yourself and really enjoy it   i suppose being aboard you dont have to worry over any embarrassing incidents because you wont ever see the people you meet again  this is why i love to do karaoke on holiday but never at my local pub  i dont care who judges me abroad ill never see them again   having said this you can always make yourself feel safer by making arrangements if things were to go pearshaped having funds to buy an early ticket home etc   i do think that having a member of staff or a student counsellor or whatever is available would help you in terms of getting emotional support and in terms of putting practical things in place to help you on your course and trip i woke up feeling alright actually  then got a bit pissy earlier  now im ok again huh they didnt mention your original charge    im sorry that theyve adjourned for another month what a pain in the arse  well done for making it i know youre probably wondering why you bothered but you did well to get there jellytots are you in the uk have you spoken to your local council about applying for social housing  another thought you could go into a womens refuge theyre not just for physical abuse theyre not just for abuse between partners  they accept any woman in an abusive situation in their home i went into one because of my brother and met another young woman in there who was escaping from her parents  its a big step and perhaps not something youd think about and thats ok but its always an option  you dont have to stay in that situation  the thing is even if your docs gave you the best counselling and the best medication if youre home environment isnt right youre not going to make a lot of progress its understandable that youre stressed  good luck for tomorrow i hope they dont keep you waiting as long as last time   gosh how to drag something out and make you anxious i agree with helena in that a talking therapy may be better suited for you seeing as the citalopram affected your concentration it may be that your university can offer this too   hopefully your doctor can help you if you make it clear to them youre not willing to take medication then theyll have to look at alternative ways to help hi and welcome to the forum   im wondering if there are any circumstances that are making you feel like this about the person i mean are they ill is there a reason for you to be concerned   im also wondering if youve had a falling out with this person that might sound like an odd question but ive felt this way when ive fallen out with somebody  perhaps due to an irrational fear that ill never see them again and not being able to come to terms with that   also do you suffer with anxiety and worry more generally   sorry to ask loads of questions its just your post is a bit vague ah thats a tricky one isnt it you and i can clearly see that this certainly isnt a crime or abuse but im sure to your son this fear is very real i agree that the thing in wikipedia isnt really relevant in this hypothetical situation in your sons mind his intention wouldnt be to look at children its his fear that a child may accidentally look at him if hes revving his car  im really sorry i cant help you  im not sure what to suggest other than to keep reassuring him that his fears are precisely that  fears unwanted thoughts not reality not who he is as a person etc  perhaps someone else may reply with some better suggestions i wish you luck though and hope your son can overcome this anxiety not having a laugh in an unkind way  i very much agree with you the log cabin is very tempting yeah i think i know what you mean   i know that in order for me not to be triggered i need to avoid the news and certain websites  sometimes i get exposed to things that i have no control over  on social media for example you do see news stories etc that are upsetting due to people sharing them   anyway sometimes i foolishly click on something even though i know its going to be upsetting to me    ill read every comment on an article to either validate my view that the world is unsafe or to hopefully find people who are outraged actually i think for me thats a key point   sometimes its not simply the triggering article itself that i look at  its more important to see other peoples reaction because i depend on them for some kind of reassurance good or bad   as for why we do this to ourselves i have no idea its strange isnt it   i wonder if its because im so numb that feeling bad is better than feeling nothing i dont know though   im sorry that youre not feeling too good having looked at not nice stuff take care of yourself x i think this is very sensible actually  the trouble is facebook has been good for me in terms of finding out about events and spiritual workshops that i  otherwise wouldnt get to hear about so i need to weigh up the pros and cons with it really but yes  i know i need to avoid the news at all costs really hi and welcome to the forum  im not a psychologist or any trained doctor so cant really give advice  ultimately if you are concerned it may be better to talk to a professional  i am wondering if hes had anything traumatic happen to him or if hes witnessed anything that may have deeply upset him because if thats the case id definitely make an appointment with a doctor to be safe it may also be worth considering seeing if you can find something like art therapy for him  i would say though that peoplechildren can be shy and anxious by nature that doesnt mean there are mental health issues nor that theyll develop mental health issues youve not said how old he is but this could just be a phase that hell grow out of  have you tried researching to see if there are any books that are aimed at parents of highly sensitive children  it might be worth looking for something along those lines i suppose ultimately it seems like he needs reassurance that everything is safe and encouragement to come out of his shell a bit more do you reckon  ive heard it said all fears can come down to a fear of death  not sure if i believe that because there are fears that i have that i cant link to death ah cool  i like your new name and am glad this one has more positive connotations for you oh err  im so sorry you can change your settings to only get messages from contacts  which is what ive done  i presumed we were already friends but checked and were not anywho ive sent you a request so hopefully itll work now  oh and sorry its taken me a while to respond  not been online much today x all sounds very overwhelming   i suppose you already know that anxiety around exams is natural  but your experience of being able to feel other peoples pain is a lot to take   i mean it might not be your kind of thing but have you looked into things like psychic protection carrying a crystal or visualising a protective bubble around yourself can help you become less affected by other peoples stuff  oh and when are you due to see your therapist next is it long for you to wait   youve done so well to get through the last few weeks  i know youve had major struggles sorry you didnt sleep too well last night but just wanted to say that it was really good of you to use those selfsoothing techniques teanature stuffnetflix to try and help yourself  im sure the appointment tomorrow will go ahead as planned youre nearly there i know its been hard but help is near not sure if i can know a solution to give you i do want to welcome you back though just want to say im sorry youre on a downer family pressures can really affect you cant they im glad youre getting some money whilst youre going through the appeals process  that is a good sign  really hope you find the companionship you seek soon hey  its a tough one isnt it whether or not to see yourself as mentally ill  i think there can be this idea that to be mentally ill you must be really out of touch with reality etc but mental illness does include anxiety and depression   as far as the thoughts about hurting people id say that yes that does sound part and parcel of an anxiety disorder in fact i think intrusive thoughts can happen to those with various types of diagnosis   an anxiety disorder is an umbrella term a bit like mood disorder that refers to a group of disorders  so anything from agoraphobia to ocd would be considered an anxiety disorder  general anxiety disorder is just a specific type of anxiety disorder hope that makes sense welcome to the forum   i had similar thoughts to purple chaos  is your bedroom secure if not perhaps you could get a lock fitted there are practical steps you can take which hopefully can help you feel safer  locked door a little nightlight keeping a mobile phone with you in case you need to call the emergency services etc    i also agree with whats already been said about seeking counselling for yourself it could really help you   finally i am also wondering if youve considered seeing if there are any support organisations sometimes youll find carers support andor meeting for those affected by someone elses mental health issues it might be worth doing an internet search and seeing if anything like that is available in your area im sorry ive been totally crap at keeping up with this thread  but im dropping in now to see how you are hello and welcome to the forum   perfectionism and ocd are different obviously whilst im not up on what official definitions of each are i think its safe to say that things become an issue when they affect your life and your ability to function it seems to me as though youre at that point where its affecting you deeply  have you talked to a doctor about this it sounds like seeking support in the way of therapy may help it might also be worth seeking out any selfhelp material such as books or online cbt type courses welcome to the forum i have this issue but unfortunately i really dont have much in terms of advice being sensitive to noises seems to be quite difficult to sort out  i would ask if perhaps theres more going on underneath are you particularly stressed or anxious at the moment i find my sensitivity increases when im going through a stressful time sometimes also find it more difficult to tolerate a noise if a certain person that i dont like is causing them   sorry i cant be much more help can only really offer my sympathy on this one i use foam ones im intrigued  have you found better ones people can be such bastards and for no real reason other than the fact it gives them a sick sense of power i can imagine it would leave you feeling quite threatened  im really sorry you had this experience i know when things like this have happened to me its really played on my mind for the rest of that day at least its upsetting  i hope you get your drivers license soon in the meantime have you considered wearing headphones when youre on public transport it might drown the buggers out oh cally im sorry that this whole experience is even happening dont be too hard on yourself for not making it its totally understandable that the anxiety got out of control i know its hard but try not to think about it until april   really dont know a great deal about these things but do you have to be there in court for them to make a decision x one of those things is enough to get you down but add them together and yep  that is a really horrid day    im pleased that your mum is able to help you whilst you make sense of the process you need to go through in order to get your benefits reinstated  but yeah not everybody has that luxury and it makes me so cross that theyre leaving people in such a situation   also well done for sorting out your heating could have been very easy to get overwhelmed and not act in that situation so all credit to you for getting it sorted   finally youve said yourself this person has never met you so try not to take her ignorance too personally shes obviously got issues of her own if she thinks its ok to be horrible to her friends on facebook   try and do something nice for yourself if you can make a cuppa and put your feet up  i hope tomorrow is a better day for you aww i hope youre ok   you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to but were here all the same i see this thread is a day or two old but aside from my mental health issues im not marrieddont have kids and i dont intend on doing either of those things  for me im actually happier when i dont have any love interests in my life   and i know lots of very happy successful and wellliked people who are single and dont have children  so yes its definitely possible cherbear    am pleased to hear that things are still more settled than they have been sounds like youre making some good progress and its lovely to see or should i say read you sounding much brighter than you have in the past x i really feel for you   i had terrible acid reflux and ended up going to the out of hours gp because i couldnt stand it in the end i got prescribed medication for it   ice cold water yes i also found yoghurt helped soothe things a bit  also try laying down on your left  i dont quite understand precisely why that helps but its to do with where everythings located in your abdomen lying on your right hand side makes reflux worse and left hand eases it a bit   hopefully its just a bad episode and will ease of once youve got the stress of the court out of the way with  but i would consider seeing a gp   not sure if youre on meds but some medications quetiapine for me makes acid reflux really bad have you told a doctor about this i think if you havent already you should discuss this with a professional because there might be a physical cause  when you say you get it falling asleep are you starting to dream when this happens also how is your head positioned are the pillows too hightoo low no i dont think you sound younger   do you live close to him do you feel any physical threat  i do think that if things are getting worse or youre fearful for your safety it may be worth talking to the police   can i ask how you feel you get in trouble for setting boundaries is this disapproval from your parents or just from your brother   the thing is i have been and still am in a similar situation  the difference is my parents know how abusive he is because he abuses them too  but theyre really too scared to act because of what might happen if they were to say no more  i dont know what its like to be a parent i can only observe what ive seen from my own mum and dad but i think its incredibly difficult for a parent to admit that their child even if this child is a grown adult is abusive its so uncomfortable to contemplate that i think its far easier for them not to face the situation at all   whilst i can understand how much it must hurt to not feel supported or protected by your parents i really think that once you admit you wont be able to get whatever it is you seek from your family you can work on getting support elsewhere   are you still seeing your therapist by the way has she offered any suggestions on how to proceed in this situation you must insist that you need an emergency appointment  if not call 111  i dont want you suffering without support  hope things get easier for you soon x i do think its important to keep in mind that the average person is pretty selfabsorbed and so any anxiety you have that people might be taking particular notice of you is probably unfounded i completely understand how it feels to be worried about people laughing at you or watching you and thinking somethings wrong with you but honestly the majority of the time people are in their own heads and taking no notice  it sounds like the apathy and feeling like nothing matters could be down to depression  from some of the things youve written it sounds like your selfesteem is quite low which again is another sign of depression  have you thought about seeing a doctor about this it really depends on the area you live in what services are available but i know in my area there are or were group cbt sessions targeted at a particular problem i attended one for selfesteem and found it really helpful not only was the content good but just going out once a week to a group where people understood how i felt was really useful i can relate to your fears and concerns about the mixing with people  as far as the job opportunity goes im not sure what to write because ive never worked   but i would say that perhaps you should start socialising in environments which are more quiet and nurturing to get used to people  something like an art class a library group a meditation group etc  things like that have helped me sounds like youre in a stressful situation with your father im sorry to hear things are so chaotic and that youre feeling so low   are you still seeing the crisis team are they any help  welcome to the forum by the way i say let the tears come  i agree with sprinkles in that crying can be very healing i think it would be sensible to tell your midwife to be honest   none of us here can give you the reassurance that the professionals can   and im sure shes got some experience of dealing with mumstobe that have come off meds and have mental health issues   as for the doppler thing there are so many reasons why you might not be hearing a heartbeat successfully does your midwife know you have one of these things perhaps she might be able to give you some good advice and help you find the right sort of place to be poking around with it well not poking around but you know what i mean oh blueberry sorry that things are really bad   please keep safe  i know youve harmed yourself but make sure to take care of yourself im loving the optimism in this post cherbear  sometimes it can feel like youre destined to feel low forever but there is always hope   even being open to the possibility of hope is huge progress so well done to you sending you who are struggling strength and love  distraction eh sometimes its just so fucking pointless because you know youre still going to feel bad after youve watched that filmcompleted that crossworddone the disheshad a bath etc  i know its difficult but please keep at it x this is something i got very unwell with in my teens  i even went as far as believing that i could leave an imprint that could be read say for instance if i put my head on a cushion or pillow i was convinced someone could then later get a download of my thoughts from that oh and i thought there was a radio channel that everybody else had access too except from me which broadcast my thoughts  its was total nightmare and the angerfearanxietyconfusion i felt during those times were horrid i cant say what one particular thing helped me get better  but one technique i used to use was thinking something and seeing how someone reacted to test it out like if youre in a waiting room and someones wearing a tie id think youve got a big stain on your tie just to see if they looked at it because if they could hear my thoughts theyd be sure to check for the stain obviously this never worked  nobody ever reacted  and so gradually i started to accept the possibility that i was wrong ah cherbear im sorry things got more difficult i think its sensible to see a psychiatrist just to have that extra bit of support there for when things arent going good hey cherbear not sure how you are now since it says you posted this 15 hours ago  but this message seems fairly bright and just shows how lovely you are i hope that you are keeping well and i think its good to go awol every now and then just take some time for yourself whatever is right for you found this online   i hope that it gives you some reassurance  im sorry that youre having to deal with this anxiety i know it can be difficult to stop worrisome thoughts but trust me in that you wont be pregnant from this have you got any advice from a professional for this or tried any alternative techniques like hypnotherapy  this isnt something ive really experienced and so i dont feel i can give you any words of advice or wisdom but just wanted to send hugs anyway im just glad that we could reach you in some way i think your worries are understandable  in my opinion a lot of anxieties and issues seem to not truly go away but are replaced in other forms this is why its important that you get the support you need to address the root cause and also help you generally feel more relaxed and in control overall are you being seen to by any mental health staff in the hospital  i know you get embarrassed and its not easy for you to confide in people but i think this realisation youve had that youve always seemed to have some form of ocd is every reason for you to be 100 open and honest with professionals  hope that youre not getting too bored in hospital x cherbear    i know what that anguish is like and im sorry that youre having to go though it  its all the more reason to be nice to yourself though  you are a lovely human being with a big heart  it would have been tragic for you to have gone in the way you intended last night aww im really sorry to hear you got to that point of trying to take your own life  i know youve been struggling loads lately im so pleased to hear that youre still with us though    perhaps the fact theyve found underlying medical issues plus the fact that you acted on your urges might mean that youll get better treatment and support  i really hope so   oh and i know what you mean about other patients  there was an old lady with dementia shouting nonstop for her husband one time i was in hospital   i really hope you get a good nights sleep in fact get as much rest as you possibly can because your body will need it   please keep us updated ill be thinking of you x i think youre doinghave done the right thing by getting checked out physically its good to rule out any physical cause first but i think that mental health has a bigger effect on physical health than people realise   it sounds as though what youre experiencing is anxietyrelated i can relate to a lot of the things youve written i dont know if you ever suffer with depersonalisationderealisation but i get it a lot and it gives me the feelings of being lightheadeddizzylack of coordination its like i cant feel my feet at all  so as im sure youve probably worked out the more relaxed you are the less these symptoms will bother you if you can find relaxation techniques to help you when youre overwhelmed with these physical feelings then that would help even if its just taking yourself off somewhere you can be by yourself practise deep breathing and visualisation im so sorry that youre going through this i wish everyone in the world were free to  love who they wanted to without fear of persecution  i have to admit i feel a bit out of my depth trying to give you an answer because if you were to be who you are openly the consequences are potentially very bad however to live a lie could make you deeply unhappy  so emigration is definitely not an option for you  how would it feel to be single and not marry anybody would there be shame in being a single woman im really sorry that you selfharmed but im glad that you are in hospital where you can be looked after   perhaps it may be that its not comfortable to tell your family thats ok   im sorry if this has already been suggested but have you sought out counselling at all  whilst we are here to help and support you theres only so much we can do online and it sounds like youre in a really bad way and need facetoface support   i wish i could be of more help but hocd isnt something im familiar with and so all i can do is tell you that i sincerely hope you feel better soon obviously youre not giving specifics so i can only answer in a vague way but id say yes  i think that essentially being starved of happiness and attention can make you a bit desperate for lack of a better phrase and cling on to things that you wouldnt necessarily otherwise value if you were happier and had other options as far as im aware as long as you dont link to commercial website trying to sell something and its more of a blog then its ok to share a link  this isnt necessarily part of forum rules but if any content could be triggering stick a warning on just in case i just wanted to say i hope the doctors are supportive and can help you ive got similar issues and suspect fibromyalgia but the doctors never really acknowledge things  they do tests xrays blood tests but as they all come back clear nothing gets done  try do to what you can in terms of managing things yourself painkillers hot baths hot water bottles sportsbandage type things for ifwhen your ankle plays up etc i agree with jruth in that practising breathing exercises and focusing on your breath in a mindful way may help out   you havent had a cold or anything that would explain why these feelings have been back the last 2 weeks  perhaps it could have been the stress of christmas and new year am only speculating though   the fact that you were ok at your gym session probably shows that this is anxiety rather than you being unfit or having any physical problems   if its any consolation i get this a lot too  similar to what jruth described  a lot of the time i dont realise how shallow my breath is until i find myself taking a big gasp for air out of the blue i urge you to reach out and tell someone professional that you are suicidal and that you have plans and nearly went through with them   im also wondering if they know you have selfharmed which by the way is nothing to be embarrassed about you are low and it was some way of coping with your innerpain   please please please tell someone in real life you are feeling this way   do you live alone  if you do do you feel there is anyone you could stay with or invite to stay with you while youre feeling vulnerable and have these plans  if you dont live alone perhaps reach out to whoever it is you are living with and explain youre unwell and need some support you dont need to tell them all your business if you dont want to  its just important that people around you are aware that youre really going through the shit at the moment   it might seem like its not worth telling anybody what the point etc but i can assure you people would rather know youre having these kinds of struggles now than when its too late hi and welcome to the forum  how long have you been on the citalopram for also who prescribed it  a gp or a psychiatrist  i do think medication helps but is generally limited in how much it can help  in order to make things easier in the long run its usually best to have some kind of talking therapy andor learn selfhelp skills  i know that doing a lot of selfdiscovery reading selfhelp books seeing a counsellor and generally trying to be aware of my thought patterns to identify thinking distortions as they happen has helped me i dont think you should feel bad or like you let yourself down the principle of your actions i say were right racism is unacceptable and dickheads like that who think its a laugh to be so flippant about it do need to be told  if you dont normally act like that i understand that it can be a shock for you too i know on the rare occasions that ive got angry or even just politely defended myself my heart is practically in my throat and im shaking like a leaf because its so unusual for me to be anything other than silent  in answer to your question though yes  irritability is definitely connected to anxiety think about it the anxiety is putting all of this adrenaline around your system and is giving you that physical fight or flight response its understandable that every now and then the fight will win  i get terribly pissy inpatient and intolerant sometimes it comes on out of the blue but i know its because im feeling very overwhelmed and physically pumped up if that makes sense x welcome to the forum  would you say you have anxiety issues in general or that its more your situation with your daughter thats the issue how is she feeling in all of this  is she happy i dont know what its like to be a parent but i can imagine that it must be very difficult at times and that you just want to see your baby happy however as im sure you know theres only so much you can do and you dont really have any control over this situation worrying wont change anything it will only cause you to feel stressed out  it may be worth looking into why you feel so consumed by the worry about your daughter whether you feel there are other issues in your life that are overwhelming you too oh viktoria   i have had episodes of crying hysterically and screaming for hours on end  it wasnt nice  but a panic attack has never lasted so long for me    you must be absolutely exhausted i really hope you can get some rest to make up for last night  if you havent had the opportunity to tell a professional about this i think you should   whilst prn medication such as a benzodiazepine can be addictive and are not a longterm solution you should have something with you to take the edge off in case something like this happens again its frustrating that youre not being offered help especially as youre acknowledging your problem and wanting help  is the reason youre not wanting to do the group therapy because youre scared of what other people might think if so there are rules and confidentiality agreements i know its easy me saying that but it might be something that could support you  are you in a financial position to seek your own help  i go to a lowcost counselling clinic and its helped me more than quite a few nhs workers ive had am glad you had second thoughts so i gather your little sis doesnt live with you is there anything you can do to help you distract yourself when your boyfriend is away  im really sorry that the voices are bad and are dragging you down so much hope that things ease off for you soon x it does sound like you are overthinking and perhaps driving yourself up the wall with worry i do think rasselas is correct in that it seems as though you need to have a bit more confidence in yourself obviously i cant make generalisations every woman is her own person in the same way every man is his own person but i would advise you to just keep on communicating honestly and openly with your girlfriend share your feelings with her and be open to whatever she wants to share  im sorry i cant be any more specific or helpful i wish you the best of luck with the situation though im ever so sorry to hear that you are struggling so much especially with your new baby   postnatal depression must be so difficult   i think that it may be worth trying to get your prescription if you can you never know it might help you  also remember to keep communicating with your doctor or health visitor   you are unwell and so remember you have no reason to be ashamed for what you are thinking and feeling   the most important thing is that people who are around you know how you feel on a daytoday basis and can be there to give you extra support not sure what advice to give  but wanted to say i know exactly how you feel   im struggling a lot with this at the moment  sometimes i feel like im about to die its really not nice   just try to relax when you can and get plenty of rest   hope that things improve soon it may be the hyperactivity and business surrounding christmas and new years thats making things particularly difficult at the moment at least thats what im trying to tell myself im sorry to hear you had a bad day too  were here if you want to talk more about it  am hoping that things get better soon i think theres some statistic that says 8090 of things we worry about never happen  i can relate to what you might be experiencing im full of anxiety and fear at the moment due to the situation going on with my family obviously its different circumstances but i totally understand the worrying is enough to drive you up the wall  try to keep that fact in mind and know that your worst fears are very unlikely to happen     am sorry that i cant say anything more helpful sending love though oh thats wonderful news   im really pleased for you big congratulations to you hi sandyp  i havent actually seen this forum user post for a while so chances are you might not hear from her  im sorry to hear that you share the same struggle  it must be incredibly difficult and create a lot of anxiety   so did you have an incident which triggered this all off  are you managing to eventually eat enough at the moment   i would suggest seeing a doctor and asking for some therapy or counselling to explore this anxiety in hopes that it might help you move forward sorry to hear youre struggling with this  i get a similar thing and there doesnt seem to be an obvious explanation for it   do you keep a diary am wondering if perhaps you might be able to identify a trigger if you write things down though sometimes these things dont always have a reason   the thing i do when im overcome with fear and anxiety is to remove myself from whatever situation and retreat   spending time on my own gives me that space to regather davey is right they are intrusive thoughts and a lot of people have them  i understand how completely distressing they are because i get them myself from time to time   unfortunately theres no real way to stop them you can do your best to adjust your thought pattern when they come up so that you are selfforgiving and know that its no reflection on who you are as a person  are you generally quite stressed out and anxious taking steps to be more relaxed overall might help them not crop up in the first place im not entirely sure what to say as this isnt something ive experienced  perhaps when your throat infection clears up you might start to find it easier   is it swallowing everything or just food i wonder if stuff like soups are ok just wondering if youll be ok to get enough nutrients    it might be worth going back on your meds if this continues on and is causing you to worry    also wanted to say that there are lozenges you can get that anaesthetise your throat i know there are some specifically for people who sing for example theres also a spray you can get  mind you i dont know if that would help because it is an odd sensation when youve used these products   wishing you well anyway hope that you can get this sorted x i agree with purple chaos  it would probably be a good idea to see your gp or someone who can help at your college such as a counsellor   id imagine though that the approach they may try is one thats down the route of cognitive behavioural therapy  there are selfhelp books out there on the subject that can be quite helpful though of course theyre no substitute for a professional working alongside you   if you dont already my advice would to be to break big tasks down into smaller ones  rather than tackle the whole thing in one go do a bit then take a break it might help im sorry to hear about your situation  its sounds really difficult and probably all the more stressful given the time of year   solicitors are a pain in the arse my parents tried to sell the family home last year and it feel through needless to say my mother ended up calling the guy a useless prick   i really hope the domestic abuse advisor is someone you feel comfortable talking to  i have had an experience of going to a womens refuge myself and i cannot praise the staff who worked with me enough  remember that may well be an option if it gets to a point where you cant take any more   eventually when youre living on your own i do think that how you feel will improve   it may be worth thinking about getting some counselling once your settled to help you move forward from such a crap experience this isnt a disorder at all in my opinion  you are struggling with some very deep emotions and circumstances the fact shes been diagnosed with cancer are almost forcing you to face your feelings  whilst it must feel very painful for you in my opinion youre not mentally ill   i think its natural that youd feel her pain and that you wish you could make her feel better  however i do think that its important for you to focus on other things and to not allow this situation to take over   there may be a danger of becoming a bit obsessed with her and feeling unhappy unless youre in contact with her which could result in you feeling very hurt   i was wondering if youd considered counselling at all i think it might help you to talk to someone and also to have somebody else there to help you keep focused so that you dont neglect other areas of your life welcome to the forum im glad youve finally posted    obviously nobody here can diagnose but i relate to your post and from my experience it sounds as if you could be getting depersonalisation or derealisation  when i get it it feels like my awareness is outside of my body it makes me dizzy uncoordinated and i feel like i cant feel my feet  it is worrying but its also recognised as a thing that people have so its nothing to be too concerned about  unfortunately there is no cure for it the reason it happens is usually when youre overwhelmed either with depression or anxiety or any other mh issues  the more you relax the better it generally can be   though i know thats easier said than done because the depersonalisation makes me anxious the anxiety causes depersonalisation its a vicious circle   one thing that helps is to just constantly reassure myself in my mind that i am physically healthy and what im feeling is the result of anxiety  and it will pass   hope that helps a little bit yes  ug has a good point i forgot to ask how long youve been on citalopram for i take it still now but i remember the first few months on it i felt very spaced out and strange i can definitely see how this could be the case some people who are very happy seem to be a bit dim i find that when im depressed my mental functioning goes downhill big time i cant concentrate i cant remember anything and i genuinely just feel like my brain has been replaced with mush dont underestimate how much it can affect you  if you havent been diagnosed with a learning difficulty or had extra support when you were in school as a child i wouldnt think thats the issue because schools are quite good at picking up on that sort of thing  i dont necessarily think that theyd teach you separately they might provide you with extra information when i did a course at college the tutor printed off the slideshows for me because sitting in the classroom and staring at the screen i found it hard to concentrate i also found the pace too fast so it was hard to make notes it might also be an idea to make notes too if you dont already i also take shortterm prn medication lorazepam but thats definitely not a long term treatment as its highly addictive its more emergency only   just wanted to ask for clarification  has this only started happening since the citalopram sorry am just a bit confused clive if you phone up the dwp and tell them that your appeal letter will be late due to your gp surgery not being able to fit you in until the 6th jan then they will take that into account and extend the deadline my cpn was away on leave when i needed a form filling in and so i phoned the dwp and they allowed me to send my form in late obviously services will very depending on where you live but the citizens advice should be able to help you out too also just want to say im so sorry that your benefits have been stopped thats the last thing you need when youre ill  and at this time of year it must be all the more upsetting sometimes i can feel my pulse in my throat  i know that must sound quite unusual to some people but i notice it particularly when ive been doing some strenuous exercise or if im really anxious  ive found that drinking a glass of water and deep breaths can help shift the feeling  while its easier said than done id try not to think too much about it particularly as your doctors have said that you are in good health im sorry your friend said that to you it sounds as though shes not very supportive of you hi cazmorty153  welcome to the forum i hope you dont mind me saying this but can i make a suggestion that you start a new thread and repost this its just that i dont know how many people will see your post tucked away here and a new thread specifically for you is likely to get more response x im glad you spoke to your gp and got some help  fingers crossed youll start to feel better soon i was having similar thoughts to dubblemonkey  a metallic taste in the mouth can be the result of quite a few different medications have you been on any new medications lately  in some cases a dryness in the mouth can lead to a metallic taste  i wonder if you were hyperventilating particularly badly during this experience and that might have caused it  i would say also that perhaps the next time you see a doctor mention it to them not saying that to worry you  i just think someone with medical knowledge will be able to give you a better idea of whats going on and may be able to provide a more reassuring explanation yes it does sound like anxiety to me i get the same symptoms and just like you said sometimes they just come out of the blue  i can be sat down minding my own business and suddenly ill be aware of butterflies in my stomach and my heart beating erratically its odd i think its important to reassure yourself that theres nothing physically wrong though sometimes im convinced im about to have a heart attack but i have to just keep reminding myself its only the anxiety  have you spoken to a counsellor at all about losing your mum do you feel youve properly grieved am asking as you said that your mothers death seems to coincide with all of these physical feelings happening x stress is a killer if it doesnt result in a mental disorder itll probably affect your physical health in some way its why i think a whole lot more needs to be done to reduce stress in order to prevent these illnesses from happening in the first place ocd isnt something ive struggled with so dont have much insight to share  but i do experience things similar to what youre describing the false memories  sometimes it can get really difficult to distinguish between reality and whats gone on inside the mind  also when things feel so real and are so specific a part of me almost thinks its some great psychic insight or premonition which makes ignoring the thought more difficult   do you practise grounding exercises much it might help you feel more in reality and as a result perhaps youll be more confident in knowing whats really happened  the 5 things for 5 senses thing is really good so for example you focus on 5 things you can smelltouchseehear taste isnt so easy in the moment youre in   i hope things get better for you soon anyway i definitely agree that if you want to be healthier its best done in steps im pretty sure ive seen some research this was years ago so dont ask me to find the source which says that youre more likely to be successful in improving your health if you focus on one issue at a time im sorry i havent replied sooner  i have no experience of day hospital at all so didnt feel i could say anything helpful i do hope its gone well for you today though let us know how you got on if you get a chance hey  im not entirely sure what your situation is or whether youre in trouble or giving evidence  have you told someone youre not fit to attend  i wouldnt take too much propranolol but im sure if it helps it wont matter if you take a bit  sorry i cant be more helpful as i said im not entirely sure whats going on for you and so wouldnt want to say something wrong its really difficult having anxiety i despise going to any normal shops to buy shoes or clothes they always seem so busy   i use jd williams though that is classed as a womens clothing site  if you type in free returns with a search for wellies it might produce some more results if youre stuck for places to look oh i hope you find a decent pair soon  when i used to walk the dogs daily my wellies broke and i did the plastic bag thing its a nightmare x i think its quite a common symptom of anxiety its something i get a lot and have had it for as long as ive had anxiety 10 years  if youre quite stressed or anxious in general that feeling of needing to take a breath can come and it can seem out of the blue  when i get it i think that perhaps somethings going on on an unconscious level so im not 100 aware of just how anxious i am  im not sure if trying for a big breath makes things better or worse  ive not seen anything that says either way from personal experience sometimes when im feeling breathless and im doing breathing exercises i do find my pulse goes faster when im trying for a big breath which can make things worse because essentially it makes me want to breathe more  i think its about trying to find a balance breathing as you need to when youre anxious and then focusing on deep breathing when things are calming down a bit  hope that makes some sense x since its a one off i wouldnt be too worried you said yourself that youre really stressed at the moment and its understandable that your dreams are reflecting that high anxiety see how it goes and if this happens again its easier said than done im quite a serious person by nature im not really a person someone comes to for a laugh im generally seen as sensible and sensitive in real life i this is im happy to prat around on the forum  they say to ask yourself will this matter a year from now i think trying to gain some perspective about how important something really is in the bigger picture can help x i agree with purple chaos   i admit ive said hurtful things to people in the past when ive been in a bad way and i have regretted it it is common to lash out   i know its hard when someone says something horrible to you even if you know logically that you shouldnt take it personally it doesnt take the hurt feelings away   try not to think about it too much or beat yourself up its not true x i think thats only true to a certain extent being highly emotional doesnt make for truth always the fact that they apologised shows that they didnt mean what they said and still want your friendship i think gajolene is right in that these things are very individual also personally i think it can depend on the type of anxiety youre struggling with  antidepressants have helped me a lot in terms of social anxiety im still an introvert still dont like being the centre of attention but i dont have that crippling embarrassment whenever i say something i found that the antidepressant im on citalopram has really helped me loosen up in social situations however when it comes to things like assuming the worst case scenario when i dont hear from someone catastrophising it hasnt helped a great deal  just my experience anyway if you do decide to give it a try i hope that it helps x agree with others here you should definitely talk to a professional  my personal experience of lorazepam is that it can actually make you feel really weird very depersonalised paranoid and freaked out  of course everybody reacts differently to medication but its not uncommon for lorazepam to make peoples mental health worse ironic i know   i think a doctor would help you get properly sorted if you need help sleeping there are medications they can prescribe that have sedating side effects which you could take at night providing the medication would be of use to you there are certain antidepressants like mirtazipine that can help insomnia just wanted to welcome you to the forum and say im sorry you had such a frightening experience  i suffer from depersonalisationdissociation sometimes and the disorientation that it can cause is quite scary  the trick is to try to relax i know its not easy but the more stressed out you are the more likely these experiences are going to happen   i dont see any harm in taking supplements even if you have health anxiety you might notice that you feel better not sure if youre uk based but i remember reading a statistic that says most people in britain are vitamin d deficient due to the lack of sun we get   i would have a word with any professionals working with you about the incident on the bus its better that they know x absolutely and you cant put a time frame on moving forward from something like this  just because its been 2 years doesnt mean that youd be any less affected by it particularly if youve not had support in dealing with the painful emotions left behind  im not a psychiatrist obviously so cant really say whether relationships cause stress disorders from my personal opinion though id say yes  they definitely do  have you sought any help for things it sounds like youre dealing with a lot of unpleasant emotions  betrayal trauma deceit etc i really think you would benefit from therapy or counselling if thats an option for you at the moment hey dan you shouldnt feel ashamed or like a let down i dont know if that shame comes from comparing yourself to other people or thinking about how you should be but just remember that everybody in life is on their own path what one person can do without a second thought is actually a huge victory to someone else also it actually sounds like youve made some really big progress over the years  from my experience 1  i take really deep breaths i imagine that im trying to blow up a balloon with the fewest breaths possible  really use up as much of my lung capacity as possible and count eg inhale count 1 2 3 4 hold count 1 2 3 4 exhale count 1234 rest count 1234 also i find putting my hands on a flat surface helps to steady me a table is best but a wall can work too then i just focus on putting one foot in front of the other walking slowly to the bathroom and putting some cool water on my face i think that in time you will be able to make your own little ritual like the one i mention above  but hopefully you can try out what helps me to enable you to see what works for you  2  the absolute worst that can happen is youll pass out but its really unlikely because anxiety is actually doing the opposite ie pumping too much blood around you than what happens when you faint ie not enough blood if you did pass out im sure people around you would be incredibly sympathetic honestly i think the majority of people arent unkind and if they were to witness you having an anxiety attack they would just want to help  3  yes once i asked a man if i could lean against him because i thought i was going to topple over he kindly helped hold me up and asked me if i was ok if there was anything i can do and it passed as i said i think most people would be more than happy to help as long as they werent in a hurry to get somewhere  i think the more you can go out and have positive experiences the easier things will become i used to hate going out on my own wouldnt go anywhere with my parents but over the years ive had some really rewarding and happy times when ive been out alone  and now i love my independence i have this problem too  i remember one time when i was 11 there was a big stain on my chair in class to top it all off i was known as the only girl who had started her period i got asked if the stain on my chair was me coming on my period   but you know what the next day it was completely old news and nobody mentioned it again   i understand this may be hard to believe but i am pretty sure nobody will say anything to you they have probably forgotten all about it already  even if they thought about it afterwards im sure they understood that in that kind of heat is was bound to be sweat  its a natural bodily function   perhaps in future you could just be quicker to put your chair under the desk but honestly i doubt its necessary id be willing to bet you werent the only one who had sweat stains on their chair you were just too fixed on your own situation to notice anybody else x im pleased you were checked over and that nothing too abnormal that would have required you to be in hospital was found  also well done for getting over to the doctors thats a big thing    hope you start to feel better soon anything odd going on with your heart is frightening isnt it x it sounds a lot like a panic attack to me im sorry youre experiencing this panic attacks can be really frightening and they often come on out of the blue i know the advice of doing breathing exercises is a bit overdone but if you can just focus on your breathing it might help sipping water gently might help too  if this happens again i would talk to your doctor because they might be able to recommend something to help you in the long term x i have eczema that is brought on by stress anxiety or emotional upset its very annoying x ah ive got some prescribed cream betnovate and while that usually helps it seems the hot weather is making it worse glad youve found something that provides some relief        originally posted by khuang   i also use cortisone but mine seems to be both environmental and stress related if i keep getting my hands wet my skin gets irrated and also when i am pushing myself too hard to keep up with stuff over a period of time my eczema just flared up a bit which i suspect is due to the stress of moving its not as nearly as bad as a few other outbreaks only have one cut associated to it this time around and it isnt on the knuckle either which isnt very common for me   you have my sympathy  i get both wet and dry eczema the dry eczema on my hands i get in the winter its very painful when your knuckles open up like cuts i remember someone asking me if id punched through a window when it was really bad a few years ago not the impression i want to make on people  x when i had my little bike i used to love the feeling of being out too  nice weather close to the nature wind blowing my cares away so yeah i can relate   currently the only thing that chills me is being in the sea i like being at the seaside but sometimes when its hotbusy i get a bit angsty however when im in the water the business on the shore seems to far away and i feel held by the ocean x it was just a little 125 yamaha sr i loved it though  and i agree secluded spots by the beach are better thats one of the reasons i like swimming in the ocean it gives me that sense of a vast open space around me x i was first referred to a psychiatrist 2 months before my 13th birthday  im 24 now and while i still have my issues i can relate to your situation   i just want to say that i think the key thing is to take things one small step at a time  i think its great that you want to go to uni and i wouldnt discourage that at all  however i know when ive had big plans theyve just been too big and ive ended up getting too overwhelmed and backing out  ive achieved far more when ive done something i know i will be able to manage and stick to like a college course thats one evening a week  i think that slowly building up your confidence by doing little activities and gradually increasing them will be a better way forward rather than throwing yourself in at the deep end x im sure everything will be ok when youre at home by yourself  you have dogs for company from what youve said and they can be really reassuring  obviously you have good common sense and you know what to do to keep the house safe   it might be good to keep communicating with your family through texts if you can   although having said that i suppose they have to be camping somewhere where there is good signal   oh and the what are you doing question is such a pain in the arse isnt it i know its supposed to be light chit chat but it isnt half annoying  x i know its not quite the same as hearing the voice of a loved one but do you ever call any helplines  sometimes it helps just to have a voice on the end of the phone especially if youre worried you might harm yourself x its understandable that you got triggered  im sorry that that happened though   zoeyz is right it might take a while before you stop feeling so unsettled by seeing him particularly if there is unresolved trauma around the way he treated you  just try to reassure yourself that you are safe now and take it easy look after yourself x peacewithin has made some really good points  i only really want to say that i can relate to feeling really clingy when im anxious  trouble is i dont have anybody to cling to  personally i just feel like a really upset little girl who needs a cuddle and some reassurance   i think thats the key really isnt it you just need some reassurance  however it sounds like no matter how much your partner assures you everything is ok you still worry which makes me think that you need to work on some selfsoothing  i always try to say some comforting words to myself when im having a bad time you might do that already but if you dont try just saying im safe its alright soandso name of person youre worring about is fine nothing bad is going to happen etc x aww im sorry to hear youve been having such a bad time of it  glad to hear you rang nhs and they checked you over and that its nothing too serious   you were lucky sometimes trauma to the head can be dangerous and you dont even know somethings wrong until a few days later  take care of yourself  x it is quite normal to have a reaction when you start medication how are you feeling now if it was a bug it might have passed i would imagine its the meds even though you dont recall having that reaction when you were last on them i know sometimes it can feel disheartening to go back on medication when youve spent time successfully without them but it doesnt have to be forever its best just to help yourself whilst youre having a rough time rather than try and struggle without help x welcome to the forum im pleased to hear that you have moved out and although finances are tough you dont have to put up with being treated like that any more x hey sapphire can you identify what the reasons are behind your fear of falling asleep recently ive been plagued with nightmares and i know that thats contributing to a lot of bedtime anxiety for me at the moment but having said that i have a more chronic long term fear around sleep and for me its do with being vulnerable and open to attack whilst im asleep  logically i know its not going to happen but i cant help but feel like when im asleep someone is going to come in to my bedroom and do something bad to me  the reason i ask is that if you have some idea of the fear around sleep it might be easier to find solutions that help you ease the fear slightly  a few general tips from me that have helped me  drinking chamomile tea using lavender pillow spray or lavender oil making a bed time charm  maybe a dream catcher or small herb pillow  something to give you some psychological reassurance even if it is a placebo effect using a nightlight or keeping the hall light on checking all doors are locked and windows closed before bed a fan next to my bed blowing cool air over me helps with my breathing if i get too anxious blocking out noise with earplugs making sure the temperature is right keeping the bedroom simple and a natural soothing colour buying nice pillows cushions throws etc to make your bed as comfortable as possible  if you can get your sleeping environment to be calming it can help also if you dont already do this then keep the bedroom for sleeping only dont watch tv or take your computer in your bedroom its better for your brain to associate the bedroom with rest x yeah dont be too hard on yourself about it  you dont need to feel stupid and statements like i should be able to deal with this are unnecessary  i think its understandable that you got stressed out particularly as he arrived pretty much unannounced  you were caught offguard and as crumpet said you actually handled the situation well   oh and just as an aside  i never offer people doing work whether its on the boiler or other maintenance stuff a cup of tea i know im a bad hostess p x im surprised that you left and im sorry i havent noticed sooner i hope that you come back but of course only if you really want to if you dont then i wish you all the best and hope life brings you some reasons to smile take care x sorry to hear about this experience coming up  sounds unpleasant all around really  ive never had to have that so i cant really say how it tastes or not  but my advice is to drink it as quickly as possible and to also hold your nose if you are allowed a mint like tabbykitten was thats probably a good idea too  you never know it might not be as bad as you think i hope that it all goes well x i dont know if this is anything similar but i took movicol regularly several years ago because i was err  a bit impacted sorry  tmi  it really didnt taste of anything at all i prepared it with squash and it just made the water feel more silky had i not have prepared it myself i wouldnt have noticed   so if theyre a similar thing then in my opinion you neednt worry too much because its not even that noticeable x welcome to the forum sara mirtazipine is a bit of a funny medication choice  did you say you were having issues with sleep to your doctor or are you on any other medication its not always the first choice of medication at least not in my experience it can make you groggy and there are other antidepressants that work on anxiety too that have less side effects im pleased that you are going to make an appointment with the gp if things havent improved at all then its no good for you to be struggling to get by on your own cbt can be useful i do find the principles of it helpful but i think you need to have a certain amount of motivation to start with if that makes sense though thats just my opinion you might find it really helpful and if its on offer to you youve got nothing to lose by going to the sessions it can feel a bit odd talking to a stranger but on the other hand it can be a good thing because its all confidential and the therapist has no attachment or relationship to you sometimes its difficult to talk to loved ones about things because there is a risk of upsetting them but with a therapist you can be assured that nothing you say is going to shock or hurt them x i dont really know what the medical term for this kind of behaviour is either but i can relate to what youre describing  it could be a result of other kinds of problems like depression psychosis mood disorders etc or it could be the anxiety suddenly rearing its head   i find it a really upsetting experience its like in my mind i just want peace and to chill out but my emotional and physical body has other ideas its like every cell is fighting with the one next to it the agitation is too much sometimes i end up laughing hysterically at whatever is angering me but i always end up in tears eventually  its so difficult   i presume theyll want to find out a bit more about you and possibly do some exploring to see if it is linked to anything else like bipolar   depending on the conclusion im guessing youll either be put on an antidepressant that has offlabel use in anxiety or possibly even an antipsychotic  i dont know  i hope that you get some help with this though i understand the experience and its horrible x im on citalopram and quetiapine but those meds arent so much related to these episodes i do have prn medication meaning you dont take it daily only when you really need it of lorazepam and i find that they do help me calm down in these situations particularly when i feel im at risk of hurting myself its good that you have told your therapist hopefully in the upcoming sessions you can talk through it x lorazepam is pretty fast acting personally its been more affective for me than valium theyre addictive and not meant for long term use i try to be as stingy as possible with how often i take them but they do help x just wanted to say that i appreciate how nervous you must be ive taken journeys on a train alone approximately 4 times and whilst it does get easier i do find that i dont fully relax on the journey i only briefly went on a virgin train from crewe to chester which was probably less than half an hour but it the train seemed in pretty good condition  reasonable amount of room easy to get to the loo decent size toilet as a plus size i hate loos that are too small  no room to swing a rats arse oh and some trains have a quiet carriage specifically for people who dont want to be around obnoxious people making phone calls etc  i hope that others here have helped assure you that youll be ok  because you will be ok x you have the air conditioner on and your mother doesnt want you to sorry i got a bit confused reading your post x so do you find the air conditioner helps drown the sound out or is it that it helps your breathing when you are anxious i get very easily startled by noises too even a little sound like a door slamming shut can send me into a huge panic and i get scared im having a heart attack i understand where youre coming from i find that listening to music through headphones has helped me a lot although that means that sometimes you dont hear people approach and so theres a chance that you might get a bit jumpy if someone suddenly appears is your mother understanding about your anxiety x sorry to hear youre feeling this way  just wanted to say that youre not alone though i can relate and im sure others here can too  my life seems a constant dance between taking breaks and suppressing the pain that causes me to want to escape and finding the painful feelings overflowing in spite of my best efforts to ignore them   i think it takes a lot of time and a lot of work on yourself before you can really be present i think too that you need to find someone who really gets you and is supportive to take the journey alongside you and really witness your hurt so that it can be healed   baby steps  youre doing the best you can with the resources you currently have x seeing as this post is from yesterday and you said you were seeing the gp tomorrow im probably a bit late to give advice but just wondered how you got on at your appointment x fluoxetine is a funny one in my experience  the symptoms you are describing are not good if you still feel like this in two weeks time i would go back to the doctors and say that you dont think that the medication suits you  personally i found fluoxetine actually increased the nervous energy that i was feeling and made things around me seem really speeded up it was very overwhelming  see how it goes   also sorry to hear about the tax credit stuff i hope that the situation can get sorted remember that organisations like citizens advice are there to help if you feel just a bit too overwhelmed x obviously you have some underlying issues and i dont want to undermine that but a lot of what youre experiencing to me sounds like it is being exasperated by the stress of the esa business  how are you coping financially at the moment do you have any money to rely on  im so sorry you are waiting so long personally i think its disgusting what they are doing to people making them wait with no payment whatsoever urgh  i could rant for hours about it but ill spare you that  are you phoning the dwp to see if theres any progress being made or if youre any closer to an outcome  i presume youre waiting for the mandatory reconsideration  i dont know if it would help but if you are having these physical issues as a result of the stress id see your gp i dont know if theyve got much power to speed up the process but they might be able to offer some help   it sounds like theres not much else you can do at the moment and that you are at the mercy of the dwp  i know its a bit oversaid but any relaxation techniques would be good for you at the moment  also if youre not already then make sure you are drinking plenty of waterfluids sometimes a headache can be caused by dehydration i always have a glass of water before i consider taking any painkillers and usually the water was all i needed x i agree with buttercup in that this is a fairly normal reaction there is antianxiety medication that can be prescribed for as and when you need it its not ideal for long term use but if its just on these big occasions it may be worth speaking to your doctor the only thing i will say is that these medications can make you very sleepy and so you probably wont be at your best if you need to be speaking or meeting new people antinausea medication might help there are more herbal things you can try if thats something that interests you chamomile tea is very calming also ginger is really good for keeping nausea at bay  flower remedies can help and personally i have found rescue remedy to be very helpful i remember taking some before flying overseas when i went on holiday with a friend because i was a bit nervous about the flight and it helped me feel much calmer x so many good suggestions here this is a really useful thread  creativity is good i enjoy crossstitching and crafty stuff too as others have said  when im at a certain anxious point i do have prn meds and i also tend to focus on breathing and sipping water  but prevention is good i think gajolenes point about staying away from potentially triggering stuff in the media tv shows music news social media is a really important one  i got very very unwell several years ago when reading the daily mail website was part of my daily routine i also got really hooked on conspiracy theories not helpful in the slightest    whilst avoidance isnt always helpful when it comes to things like going out or doing some grocery shopping it is a good idea not to expose yourself to stuff that you just know is going to upset you x hi louisa welcome to the forums am glad you decided to join up and post i definitely agree that you are suffering from anxiety i wonder if this need you have to confess would fall under compulsive behaviour do you feel its something you have to do even if you dont necessarily want to its still early days for the citalopram whenever you start or come off of medication it can leave you feeling a bit rotten but hopefully it wont last too long if things turn really bad ie you get suicidal thoughts then you need to let a doctor know immediately because sometimes antidepressants can make people worse its more likely to happen if youre under25 anyway give it a couple of weeks and see how it goes who prescribed the medication for you are you seeing a mental health specialist or was it just a gp x well do you have someone you can talk to or any referrals taking place it may be worth going back to the gp and asking if there is counselling or therapy available explain that youd like to try other approaches before taking medication i think its a worthwhile idea i agree that sometimes medication just masks the problem but just make sure that you do have that alternative support in place x i think when anxiety is an issue you can very easily overthink and it can just make matters worse  also i dont know about you but i know that with some medication i just find it makes me literally feel like im wearing a mask and that im not quite connected to the world around me  facial expressions for one are very difficult i find that my face completely betrays me when im trying to portray myself a certain way its very frustrating it seems that it never really reflects how i want to be coming across  when i try to act like im ok and fine i can almost feel the awkwardness in my face and i worry that im coming across as false  oddly ive had people say that i look really well and have even been told i look glowing when ive felt like absolute shit   while its easier said than done if you can think less about how youre coming across or what people think of you then i think that the way you express yourself will be more natural  try not to let what strangers might be thinking get to you those that know you are the people that matter and as long as they understand you then thats what matters x i dont think it sounds like an excuse certain therapies arent suited to everybody i think that cbt does have its limits and personally i think youve got to be at a certain point in your recovery before you can implement it have you ever been prescribed an antidepressant i know that some of them are prescribed to help anxiety as well as depression i have found that the citalopram ive taken has helped me in terms of my anxiety as well as my mood x i hope the assessment has gone well  or goes well depending on when you read this honesty is the best policy i hope that you get some better support as a result of the assessment x it sounds like this job is causing you a lot of stress   nobody should be that depressed at work that they consider putting themselves in hospital a better option than being at their job  what kind of financial responsibilities do you have are you living alone do you need to pay billsrent etc  you say your dad isnt very helpful i presume you live at home  the reason i ask is that if you are that unhappy then its probably best that you find work elsewhere it sounds like the workplace is quite dysfunctional and whilst you can try your best to succeed there it seems that there are dynamics with managers and colleagues that arent going to change   im sorry if me telling you to quit your job isnt the answer you want to hear perhaps someone with a bit more experience of being in employment can help  i just think your health and wellbeing is a priority it would be awful if you were to hurt yourself seriously simply because the stress of work got too much for you to take x im glad to hear that you will be seeing a therapist again soon  to answer your question yes  it is possible that people can go through their whole lives without any recollection of abuse and then suddenly memories come flooding back  whilst i agree that the past cant be changed and therefore it doesnt always seem logical to spend time focusing on things that have happened i do think that these things need to be talked through with somebody   i think the demons of the past need to be faced otherwise all of these feelings that you describe as having the disgust anger dirty unprotected will always be there under the surface  when it comes to this sort of thing it is best that the subjects are approached slowly and in your own time in therapy otherwise things can get very easily out of hand and can leave you feeling overwhelmed  hopefully your therapist will be a good one and will be sensitive to your needs x i dont think bats bite or at least not the ones where i live they generally have to be held down andor provoked into attacking i understand that you probably understand that it is highly unlikely a bat has bitten you but that doesnt always help to calm the anxiety does it if i were you id keep a close eye on yourself if you feel youre having any serious issues then phone for a doctor it is probably just a mosquito or midges if you visit your local pharmacistchemist and ask them what they have for insect bites im sure theyll have some soothing cream and whilst youre there they could take a look and give you their opinion it might put your mind at rest x im quite complex on this issue yes i do have health anxiety at times but i havent made any lifestyle changes and have no intention of doing so lol i think on one level im quite an optimist when it comes to my health like nothing bad is ever really going to happen to me  on the other hand when im in the midst of anxiety i do sometimes worry that a headache im getting is something more sinister x i can understand your dilemma sometimes being more aware can actually be unhelpful  there is a reason for derealisation and its usually because your brain cant cope with the stress and anxiety you feel  have you been offered any therapy alongside the medication  i think that medication can help but only to a point it sounds like your thought process is clearly contributing to how you are feeling and so it would be good for you to explore your thoughts with a therapist or counsellor x intrusive thoughts are very difficult to deal with there are medications that can reduce your anxiety overall but as far as actually getting rid of the thoughts then no  there isnt any medication for it i think that counselling or therapy can help you cope with the troubling thoughts that youre having  you dont say the content of the thoughts or how they make you feel but sometimes people can get the idea that they are somehow bad for their intrusive thoughts i think with therapy or counselling you can learn to accept that the brain is a very complicated thing and ultimately we dont have control over what comes into our head however we can decide how we react to it  as hard as it is ultimately the more you think that you shouldnt be thinking something the more intense the thought becomes when it comes to intrusive thoughts ideally there needs to be some acceptance of the thought and then you can move on  also sometimes i have found distraction techniques can help doing the times tables trying to use my imagination to visualise something else eg a beach and try to imagine all of my senses experiencing the beach try to hear the waves feel the sand beneath my feet smell the ocean etc x yeah its totally your choice whether or not you decide to change your name   my full name is kind of two names in one over the years ive had just the first part then just the second part and now im back to just the first part again   i do think that names have certain energies and it can feel quite empowering to change your name if youre currently stuck with one that you dont like x ah yes sorry i missed that bit   still i would go to a gp and explain the situation to them they cant just let you go cold turkey surely or if they do they might be able to tell you what to expect and what to look out for in case you need urgent care x sorry youre still feeling rubbish gecko  im glad your boss was understanding towards you with regards to the mental health side of things  sounds like youve got a busy week ahead of you not helped by the fact youre not sleeping very well have you tried anything to help you get some sleep  also does your cpn know youre feeling really down at the moment   hopefully when the show youre doing finishes at the weekend you can catch up on some rest on sunday it might be that being so busy is wearing you down too x but youve made it you bloody well deserve flowers and cards  i mean it i really think youve done so well to stick at it in spite of feeling the way you do some time off the planet would be good sometimes wouldnt it   is it half term soon will you be getting some time off xx welcome to the forum its understandable that youre worried about affecting your family but at the end of the day you dont chose to feel unwell and so it cannot be helped has anyone in the family made any comments that would lead you to believe that they are getting intolerant im sure that they love and care about you and just want you to be better x welcome to the forum  sometimes i think friends dont really know what to say or how to act for the best im sure if they knew just how deeply affected you have been and still are by the anxiety then theyd want to help you out i suppose its just not something that people really know how to deal with because its not something that really gets talked about what kind of support would you like from them sometimes i think its just better to ask outright than wait for an offer i know its extremely difficult to reach out i never do because im too worried about it but people arent mindreaders and so if there is something you need ie maybe someone who you can call when things are getting too much then say  it sounds like there have been stressful changes in your life and so there does seem to be an explanation for your anxiety to be triggered again have you made any appointments to see your gp or anything it might be helpful to chat to them and explain how you are feeling ideally you can nip this in the bud or at least get some control over it before it goes back to how bad it was before x im probably going to make myself sound like a right cow but i dread school holidays because there are so many children about  just going into the supermarket earlier made me really want to scream obscenities   you had kids running around and skidding on the floor im a physically wobbly person and get very depersonalised in supermarkets and so my reflexes arent very quick  its lucky that the kids didnt bump into me i would have probably swore at them and their parents  also some stupid little prat said big bum big bum about me and his  mother told him to be quiet he was like no i said bin bag fucking little idiot  i blame the parents though as much as anything   basically im not a fan of children either to be honest they are noisy selfish insensitive little bastards  but you have to have compassion and realise its not really their fault if their parents havent disciplined them or taught them manners you cant really blame them for the way they are    does you tv have a headphone socket i use headphones a lot because they really help block out noises x freemymind has pretty much covered what i was going to say to you i think that bullying can have a really profound effect on people even years after its stopped i got bullied badly and a lot of what you describes sounds similar to what ive experienced though i have to say i dont like crowds but i can understand why they make you feel like you can hide better when there are fewer people around it an be quite exposing i do think the psychological nurse was very unhelpful as it sounds like you are suffering with anxietypanic attacks did you explain every symptom to her it surprises me that she can be so dismissive do you still go to schoolcollege do they have any student counselling services you can access it may be that you need to seek help elsewhere  i do just want to tell you that things do tend to get better the more you put yourself out there in the adult world school and schoolchildren can be notoriously cruel whilst you still get some arseholes no matter where you go in life generally people do grow up and stop being so mean to one another when you described how you feel when people make a negative or critical comment i could so remember how utterly devastated i used to be when i was in that situation even something quite trivial being said would be totally heartbreaking i think because of the bullying i had very low selfesteem and whatever was being said confirmed my thoughts that i wasnt good enough i have got more confidence now though and hopefully have a stronger sense of self sometimes when somebody says something critical it can say far more about them than you sometimes people have their own hangups and if youre quite a vulnerable person you can be the target for their projections what im saying is as you interact more with people and develop your filter gets better i have learned when to take on board what somebodys saying and when actually the problem lies with them and their nitpicking is nothing to do with me  it gets easier is what im trying to say x i understand your frustration  people dont just have mental health problems 95 mondayfriday   in fact i reckon most people have bad times at night and on the weekend    you know you can always phone nhs 111 if things are really bad   what i will say is the more fuss you make the more likely you are to be helped  so if youre feeling really bad dont give up asking for help because you dont want to make a fuss   i was having a really bad time last summer and in the end i was given then number of a local psychiatric ward they told me there would always be someone i could talk to on the end of a phone if i needed it no matter what time of night x hope youre feeling a bit better and im pleased people have helped you here x when im in a particularly bad way yes i can feel anxious pretty much all of the time also i spent most of my time feeling depersonalised i feel as though there is a veil between me and the real world it can be quite scary cant it  x there are some good suggestions here chamomile tea helps me i also dont think you can go wrong with lavender either  but as you say its best to ask the docs before taking herbal remedies some herbs can be dangerous if youre pregnant too not that thats a worry for me  x i think indirectly my anxiety does lead to eating problems when i get anxious i feel quite faint and out of it i think i use unhealthy foods as a way of grounding myself  i think anxiety can sometimes feel similar to low blood sugar too like when you havent eaten anything and are really hungry the shaky wobbly feeling can easily be confused x glad that somethings worked for you ive found diazepam to be not as helpful as lorazepam but nonetheless  im pleased to hear you got some relief from it  x i think its understandable that people can feel worse during the summer everywhere just seems much busier there are  more people around and theres generally much more activity  at least midsummer has passed now were closer to autumn sorry not much help is it just wanted to say that i can understand why you feel this way and im sorry that its a difficult time of year for you x i live alone and spend a lot of time by myself so i cant really relate first hand to what youre going through  do you know what particularly it is you are afraid of is it something more practical eg someone breaking in that could be helped by making some changes more locksalarm system etc   sorry to hear that this is such an intense struggle for you x i experience chest pain too  a few months ago it was particularly bad and it would knock the wind out of me  thinking about it i do have a bad posture and should probably do something about it ive heard wonderful things about the alexander technique   im glad to hear that the test from the doctors have come back as normal   whilst it doesnt take the pain away it must be reassuring for you to know that there isnt any serious underlying problem for you to worry about x i would definitely encourage you to see a gp you are having whats caused intrusive thoughts please dont judge yourself for this  you are not a bad person and you are in control of your actions its just that you are having anxiety and your brain is deciding to be a bastard not a medical term  there is help out there x the vitamin d thing never occurred to me so thanks for that info kate    it sounds bad but i am very intolerant of light i find that if im outside and its really sunny it can be quite painful on my eyes thats very vampirey isnt it   i do very much relate to what youre saying its gone half three and im feeling fine  i despise being awake during the daytime hate having to get up early for anything  it does worry me in terms of how im ever going to lead a productive life suppose just look to work night shifts    im sure its a depression thing i find the stillness of the night really comforting   for me it also makes my sense that theres nothing to live for and my loneliness much less apparent at night nobodys around theres nothing going on  so i literally dont know what im missing   sorry to make my reply about myself you are definitely not alone in how you feel x thanks pentagram its good to have a name for this because its something i experience too x sorry to hear that this phobia seems to be out of control and ruining your life there are things that might be worth a try do speak to your gp if you havent done already cbt as toasted crumpet said can be helpful there are loads of other things out there too but they arent usually available on the nhs things like hypnosis nlp or eft it does mean paying money but if youre at that point where enough is enough it could help  i am wondering if you live near a zoo at all i know that sounds odd but i know that bristol zoo offer phobia days its just a group session where they have a therapist helping you to overcome your fears and then at the end of the day the aim is to hold whatever it is youre scared of they definitely do them for spiders and snakes a bit of a long shot but there might be something out there x sometimes i imagine scenarios and they can seem so real that i am not sure if its an authentic memory or just something ive made up generally i have gut feelings as to whether or not what im thinking about actually happened and usually it hasnt  obviously when recalling a time youve had a few too many drinks is going to be difficult i think unless there is evidence facebook photos peoples comments that would show that you did do something bad its safe to assume that you probably just went home it may just be that you dont remember anything because you didnt really do anything particularly memorable x hi welcome to the forum i havent had any experience of zoloft but i have taken other ssris  they can take a while to work up to a few weeks but i have found them to be quite helpful i still have anxiety issues but i do find myself more relaxed than when i dont take them x welcome to the forum  i havent personally had any experience of the medication youve mentioned but have tried other snri drugs i wonder if theres a reason you havent been prescribed an ssri that might sound like gobbledygook to you theyre just different types of antidepressants they both ultimately try to produce the same results as one another but they work in different ways im not much of a scientist so probably havent explained it well  sorry  off on a tangent you can find bad reviews online for pretty much every type of medication each medicine will naturally work differently on each individual so whats bad for one person might be really good for somebody else  even on this board there are people who have a variety of experiences on different meds ive seen really positive reviews for meds that didnt help me at all and have seen people have a really bad time on meds that have really saved me  how long have you been taking them it takes a while for them to kick in sometimes  also sometimes people dont always take to the first thing theyre prescribed its trial and error really  i think it is possible to cope without medication but i think you need lots of tools in order to do that sometimes having some time on meds can help you just while you find other ways of coping  whether you decide to try to make a go of it without the drugs or not i really hope you start to feel better soon x urgh some meds can be so sedating   i have some friends who are very antipharmaceuticals and into their herbal healing they mean well of course but if sometimes eating your lettuce just doesnt cut the mustard and if you find a medicine that helps then really its not for other people to tell you not to rely on them x welcome to the forums  i have social anxiety too sometimes its worse than others but i can sympathise with your situation im sorry youre feeling so isolated and uncomfortable whenever you arent at home  have you sought any help for your feelings x hey welcome to the forums    have you tried talking to a different gp whilst in theory they should all be aware of mental illness some are more on the ball than others   ive seen a gp in the pasts during a crisis who said completely the wrong thing to me and was totally unhelpful ive also seen gps who are very compassionate and understanding and who have genuinely wanted to help   it may be an idea to see another gp and just explain how bad youre feeling i notice you said that your mum and sister are the only reason you dont do something stupid  its against the rules of the forum to go into selfharm specifics but if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself even if you dont think youll act on them you must tell the gp thats presuming you havent already   the only other suggestion i have is to look and see if you have a local mind centre or if rethink run any services in your area you can go onto their websites and i think you can type in your postcode and theyll show you whats available in your area x as others have said it definitely sounds like some form of anxietypanic attack   poor you theyre really horrid especially when they come on out of the blue   its good that you went to the hospital and got told you are all healthy its really good to have that knowledge because sometimes it can really feel like somethings wrong when it is just in fact anxiety symptoms ive been convinced i was going to have a heart attack before not good   hopefully when you see the doctors theyll be able to offer you some support some medications are helpful but so are some selfsoothing techniques its good that you called your mum do you have anybody else you might be able to phone   sometimes it helps just to have that contact to help keep you grounded x maybe try to do some practical things to help make sure windows are closed if you get too hot you can get a fan blackout blinds may help to block out some disturbances  i live in a flat where i have people living both above me below me and to the side  i cannot recommend earplugs enough screaming toddlers and drunk people creating a racket arent a problem for me when i need to go to sleep  if the issue is more during the day then try having the radio on or something it might feel better to hear some noise thats your own  im sorry that this is putting you on edge hopefully in time youll adjust and be happy in your new home x uh yeah i was going to reply to this thread earlier but yknow   seriously though i am a procrastinator its just as well i dont have things of great importance to do  although ive noticed in the last year or so that ive started to arrive late to appointments and stuff its not good i used to always be there early x happy birthday for tomorrow i hope the people youre celebrating with make a fuss of you   it sounds like youre a really kind person and people are obviously taking that for granted oh and i doubt youre a boring person   the thing is ive found people are just really bad at keeping in touch i know im guilty of this myself  sometimes people are busy they forget to get back to you they dont want to put themselves out there to ask to meet up because theyre scared youll say no etc  although it might feel like nobody cares and people ignore you i doubt its something being done deliberately maybe if they realised just how you felt they might make more of an effort to talk to you and make sure you felt included x as others have said talking to your doctor is a good step to take  i have too many kinds of issues to list and while i havent been cured ive definitely been helped to cope better and manage things on my own  i hope they help you too x it sounds like a tricky situation and its not nice feeling that you have to hide away  there is a risk that the situation isnt as bad as you think but by avoiding it and being fearful you could make it more awkward i dont want to make you feel bad at all because this is something thats obviously really difficult for you to deal with  have you tested the waters with the fathers girlfriend have you talked to her at all since the incident at the park  having grown up in an abusive household has probably made you more fearful than you need to be  perhaps just start by going inside and cooking a meal take little steps and youll feel braver x i did think that maybe the thought you had were along the lines of intrusive thoughts  it sounds like you might be having some kind of hallucination though whether or not its due to psychosis is another thing theres something called the hypnagogic state  basically where youre between waking and sleep  and its really common to have different kinds of hallucinations when youre in that state of being personally i think that the dark makes it worse i have some kind of night light on when i get off to sleep purely because i get that kind of thing a lot when its dark and it sometimes leaves me feeling scaredunable to relax  i think its worth sharing your concerns with a doctor though especially if its not getting much better x sometimes pain under the lower left ribcage can indicate problems with being quite constipated  you dont have to give details if you dont want to but if its something youre having a problem with you should try and sort it out  i havehad lots of issues in this area recently ive been struggling with nausea previously i was having problems with acid reflux im on tablets for it now but the tablets seem to have had a laxative effect which in turn makes me feel lethargic etc etc i think anxiety and stress can have such a major impact on the stomach and digestive system x you can get moth repellent products cant you there are certain scents they dont like i know some of the moth repellent products can smell a bit odd but there are some better ones out there that smell more pleasant than others ive seen strips of what i presume is sticky paper or it must have something on it that they dont like that you can stick to windows and stuff to keep them away  obviously it would be better to deal with the root cause but have you tried any of these preventative things  x do women have an adams apple anyway i do get a funny feeling on my throat sometimes its like i can feel my pulse in the front of my neck and its as if theres a huge lump there its usually when im upset or it can be when i exercise too much  i think it might be related to breathing  i think you should chat to a nurse or doctor about it though you probably would have noticed if something is wrong with your thyroid but as thats where the thyroid is its worth them checking to see that youre healthy in that respect x im not speaking as staff here so dont take this as official im just speaking as a fellow forum user i can understand how you or anybody else might feel quite upset and triggered by what other people may post people use this site as a place to come to talk about things that are disturbing them and thats not always good to read  particularly if youre feeling vulnerable  personally id much rather someone came onto a site like this and talk about having urges to do harmful things than to actually go out and do them in real life you must remember too that if people are posting these types of things on a mental health forum it means that they know that theyre not well and they want some help the way i see it if someone was inclined and really set on hurting someone i doubt theyd pause to post online about it  people can be mentally ill in lots of different ways i cant quite understand how other people would want to hurt someone else but having said that im sure there are others who cant understand why i would hurt myself  sometimes its good to stay away from subforums which you know you might find troubling i know when im feeling a bit overwhelmed i just stick to the chillout section  i just want to say though that in terms of the site being dangerous we do have forum staff to make sure that that isnt the case hopefully nothing gets said thats too harmful or out of control and if it does it gets moderated or edited x x yep  they do indeed apply to me   headaches  before resorting to a painkiller i drink a big glass of cold water and then wait a short while i think a lot of my headaches are due to dehydration and the water helps make them go away 9 times out of 10  aches pains and tense muscles  if its really bad then i will take a painkiller also pain relief gel is good if theres a particular area thats sore i like to use a hot water bottle tucked into my jeansskirt because my lower back is always an area that hurts but the heat really does relieve it  chest pain and rapid heartbeat  try not to freak out about it ive noticed the worse thing i can do when im experiencing chestheart issues is to panic it just makes it much worse what helps me is just calmly accepting that its just anxiety and that ill be ok  nervousness and shaking ringing in the ear  ringing in the ear i was absolutely amazed when i did some selfreflexology when i was having really intense ringing in my ears the points for ears are basically where your toes meet the sole of your feet  the length of that ridge theres also a point thats your second and third toe with big toe being first basically i just rubbed about in that area and within seconds it went its worth a go    of course i do have issues with all the other points on the list but havent really got any tips or advice on dealing with those x lets hope the report recommendations get implemented   i must admit i am somewhat surprised to read of the amount of people who suffer with anxiety and the poor coping mechanisms used   i know this isnt really a particularly nice thing to say but i do find it reassuring to know im not alone and that these problems are more common than people think x i agree with dillf  it might be helpful to see a doctor different areas offer different services so am not quite sure what help is there in your area however your gp should be able to help you you might get referred to another service that offers therapy or groups for anxiety  i think 7 months is still quite a short time in your new house its completely natural to take some time getting used to things knowing which noises are out of the ordinary and which arent  x  oh and welcome to the forum oh sorry the doctors made you feel less than understood and cared for did you meet with the mental health doctor in the end  it could be an anxiety attack provoked by the unfamiliar noises i get that a lot too but i dont think living alone helps me  its difficult when youre so easily startled isnt it the only thing that helps me when my heart is racing is to concentrate on my breathing counting my inhale and exhale x i can relate to what youve posted and would say that it almost certainly is your anxiety worsening if i were you id make an appointment with your doctor i got myself in to a bit of a state a while back and was convinced that something was drastically wrong with me i saw a gp and she was very understanding i told her straight away that i thought it probably was anxiety but i just needed some reassurance she gave me lots of different checks and confirmed that i was physically healthy  have you sought any help before for your anxiety i think you could kill two birds with one stone in seeing your gp  you can get the checks you need to be assured that youre physically ok and also talk about your anxiety and hopefully get some help for it x im sorry to hear youre struggling too it sounds like youre really trying to help yourself by keeping occupied its horrible when you want to feel better but just cant do you find things like having a bath helpful or maybe listening to soothing music sometimes when im in a bit of a state i go on youtube and there a lots of videosmusic tracks for meditation sometimes even nature noises help like the ocean or a woodland  might be an idea x i agree with kermone its likely that ptsd is making you think in this way from what youve said it sounds like she didnt show up on time anyway and so what can she expect these kind of local sites are full of time wasters ive experienced a few situations where people havent turned up when they said they would and wasted my time  anyway try to put this worry out of your mind because im sure shes probably not even thinking about the tumble dryer let alone coming to your house unannounced xx very useful  in fact i think understanding and identifying thinking distortions has been really crucial for me in managing my anxietydepression or should i say attempting to manage my anxietydepression x its a tricky situation when youre waiting to feel more robust isnt it  im in that boat for sure and the more time goes by the more convinced i am that im not going to wake up one day and feel stronger its getting out there that is going to help me feel stronger though having said that i think in your case youll be wise to hang on for a while   i dont want to worry you but i feel like youve been left it a potentially unsafe state obviously the dissociation is your brains way of protecting you but im concerned at just how vulnerable your situation sounds  will you contact the mental health servicesyour cpn tomorrow tuesday i think they need to be made aware of whats going on for you   being in a dissociated state is really horrid i know first hand how difficult it makes life   really hope you feel better soon and that you can get more support in place x gecko if you are at risk then you must phone 111 or indeed calling the samaritans is a good idea  it might help to have a real life conversation   i dont know if your hubby is supportive or not but im sure hed rather know you are safe and be woke up than find you feeling in a really bad way    am so sorry that all this stuff has been brought up and youve been left to deal with it by yourself x good idea i think thats a good decision  x im 24 and im exactly the same whether its general friendships or something more with men i always tend to gravitate to those who are much older than i am  for me i feel safer with older people i did have a lot of bullying in secondary school and its so part of me feels like people my own age arent to be trusted this is especially true of boys  then again ive always been a bit of an old soul and even though i was a very popular girl in primary school i always felt a bit different and knew that people around me werent quite on my wavelength  i wouldnt worry about it too much its nice to have acquaintances of all ages but in terms of real friendships its better to spent your time with people who you find interesting  i dont know if its social anxiety it could be how do you feel when you mix with people  of course it could just be that youre an introvert even when i spend time with people im really comfortable with i breathe a sigh of relief when i have time alone again to recharge my batteries x that must be a really unnerving thought im sure your friend was saying it from a sincere place rather than wanting to put you in a position of vulnerability perhaps it might be an idea to spend some time outside you dont have to go to where your friend recommended if you dont feel safe enough  obviously if its going to cause you a huge amount of anxiety then take it easy  but i think one way you could get rid of this thought is to go out and see that actually its safe sometimes it can be good to face the fear and see that actually the anxiety is worse than the reality x i cant wrap my brain around the idea of pensions and am not entirely sure what the government is getting at with it all  i suppose im choosing to be in denial i also find it really hard to imagine being an old lady   im sorry youve got so many health issues to deal with it must be really difficult and complicate treatment x i know you might be scared of talking to a doctor but you really must they are not there to judge you they are there to help and i guarantee that nothing you say will shock them it sounds like what youre experiencing is really frightening but if you can be brave and tell your doctor about it then they can help x obviously massage is a really good thing if youre on a budget and cant afford loads it might be an idea to see if your local colleges has a salon open to the public when i did my massage training we had one evening open to public who would pay something like 8 for a full body massage obviously nobody is a professional but we werent let loose on the public until we knew what we were doing  might be an idea have you got a bath where you live having a nice bath is good too also although they are an acquired taste herbal teas are good ive also got a microwavable lavender pillow basically you heat it up and it helps relieve muscle tension  those are just a few things that help me anyway  as i say probably an idea to go to the docs to rule out anything physical there could be a number of things causing the tension though mind you  anxiety and depression for that matter can really take its toll on the body x im not sure if it will you may not need hospital treatment not sure where youre from but they like to keep people out of hospital whenever possible do you live alone or with family im just wondering what kind of support you have around you its likely that theyll put you on some meds that should in theory help with how youre feeling  anyway you have nothing to lose by asking for help it might seem scary but im sure what youre experiencing at the moment is probably much more frightening and upsetting x ah me too isnt it annoying and the more aware you are that youre blushing the more you blush have you ever blushed so much that your eyes started watering and tears ran down your cheeks i have its bloody annoying  i especially get that thing where i have an embarrassed reaction to something im not embarrassed about whats that all about  one thing that has helped though i dont do use it so much any more is to put on a green primer  it doesnt necessarily make a huge difference it just helps to balance out redness in your complexion im sure its a bit of a placebo effect but still just by convincing myself that this green stuff on my face made my blushing less visible was enough to help interrupt that horrible cycle of making blushing worse because you know youre blushing   its a painful situation isnt it and i still get it every now and then but once youre more relaxed about it all the more it improves x also hydration if youre sleeping that much then theres a change that not only are you not getting enough vitamins but you could be dehydrated which doesnt help i would also suggest seeing your doctor too they should take some blood to rule out things like anaemia or hypothyroidism x ah im sorry to hear you and your partner had a rough patch though personally if you sorted things out after a day then it sounds like you both do really want to be with one another  its really difficult to say whether the anxiety will sort itself out on its own or whether it will stick around two weeks isnt really long enough to know either way  if i were you i would still chat to the doctor and consider the prozac if things continue to be difficult for you though thats just my view  i think its better to catch these things sooner rather than later because time can just make anxiety a lot worse x welcome to the forums   the feelings you describe of things being unreal and dreamlike sounds to me like derealisationdepersonalisation its something i experience a lot too and at times it can feel like its a sight problem and that your eyes are playing tricks on you it might help you to read up on it on wikipedia or wherever unfortunately there is no cure as such but it can be helpful to put a name to an experience and know that there are other people out there who get the same thing  i dont know if its very understood or what the reasons for derealisation are but there is one idea that its the brains way of switching off and protecting itself when things are too much considering that you are feeling that the world is scaryfragile and are being bombarded with unpleasant thoughts and imagery i do think that it would make sense that youre brain is saying thats enough im switching off  by that token its not until you really sort out the anxiety that the feelings of derealisation will get any better do you notice that these feelings are worse the more worked up you are  i think the anxiety is getting quite out of control and difficult for you to handle and is manifesting itself in the thought avalanche i cant diagnose you obviously but it sounds like an anxietypanic attack  oh and one more word of advice never google your physical symptoms i can guarantee it will make you drive yourself around the bend and make you convinced you have a very serious illness do not underestimate the physical effects of anxiety stress and depression x this isnt something ive really experienced for a long time but am finding myself struggling with now  im worrying that something bad or disastrous is going to happen the more i try to ignore it the more im convinced im having some kind of premonition   wheres the logical reasoning part of the brain when you need it   to be more specific my parents are going away for the weekend  i live on my own and they visit 2 times a week on average so i cant say i depend on them a great deal but i always have a big wobble whenever they go away anywhere  i cant specifically understand what it is that bothers me so much or why i feel so unsafe when i know theyre not a 40 minute drive away  i just a horrible worrying feeling that they wont come back and ill never see them again if you see what i mean   i got myself into a bit of a state earlier to the point where i was thinking of phoning them to tell them i love them even though they literally left my flat only a couple of hours ago after visiting me today obviously ive resisted because doing that would have only freaked them out or made them feel guilty for going or both   its so so irrational yet so so real and frightening   someone knock some sense into me theyll be fine right itll all be fine im not having some eerie psychic insight im just wobbling right very true  thanks for the reminder i have felt like this before and its all just been in my own head  and big thanks to you too lu  sometimes its just good to hear it from an outside source xx i was wondering the same as misskitty can you identify a possible trigger for this increased restlessness  a couple of things that have helped me going for a walk to get rid of that excess energy having a bath deep breathing listening to chilled out music or my nature noises album writing it down doing something creative to channel that energy into something soothing teas chamomile is great if you can stand the taste etc   if it doesnt pass it might be worth talking to whoever is responsible for your care your cpn or psychiatrist x tea and coffee do count though there are different opinions on it also people say 2 litres is the right amount but there are loads of factors that affect how much you should have this is a link to a hydration calculator i cant say that its professional or endorsed etc etc but its useful i suppose to give you some idea hydration calculator  i think the reason i was suggesting hydration is because ive been and still am at times in a similar position with excess sleep and tiredness i know that i always wake up feeling hydrated plus i was never awake long enough to get the right intake of fluid you are absolutely right in that you shouldnt start drinking lots and lots and its not good to drink huge amounts in one sitting i usually have a 15 litre bottle next to me and take sips out of it steadily during the day  ive started taking multivitamins for the last week or so i suppose its still too early to say but ive not noticed much improvement yet  i cant remember if youve already said youve been to the docs for blood tests but if you havent already then i think its worth going just to rule out any physical reasons why youre so tired x i sent mum a few texts last night and theyll be back tomorrow  its funny the bad feeling seems to have gone randomly the same as it came   i get like this a lot with people i care about feeling like theyre going to die  have no idea why this is such an issue ive never actually lost anybody that close to me really and my parents are still together and happily married  mind you ive felt totally emotionally abandoned repeatedly and its been very painful maybe thats what its about who knows xx welcome to the forum  whos prescribing your meds a gp or a psychiatrist have you explained to them that you cant cope with your moods i get the feeling that nobody is listening and its not exactly the nicest feeling in the world but im wondering whats been said or not said to you thats made you feel like that x i can only suggest what dd1ps has already said really  it is definitely worth seeing a different doctor and explaining you felt misunderstood the last time you spoke to a professional  explain the things that you do that you think are abnormal and also mention the alcohol use is a direct result of the social anxiety that you feel  i really hope you get listened to and given some help x it could be that you dont have the tic or it could be that your parents and counsellor dont see it or dont want to mention it to you  either way if you have it or not being aware of it is only going to make it worse i cant say that ive ever experienced anything like this myself but having social anxiety i know how the mind can torture itself  it sounds as though if the underlying issues with social anxiety were helped then the tic might sort itself out have you spoke to your doctor at all about your issues i know this isnt necessarily the answer to everything but being on citalopram and other antidepressants has really helped me out in terms of my social anxiety its not that im suddenly the life and soul of the party but the inhibitions that weigh me down just seem to have been lifted x as someone that left the family home not through choice and has been forced to be independent id say you really need to make sure you move out when youre ready to  as much as i used to get short tempered and frustrated sometimes i do miss having company and loneliness is a big issue not only that but it really doesnt help my mental heath in terms of my grip on reality when theres hardly anybody else around to talk to  im very daydreamy and depersonalised most of the time   is it possible for you to get out go places on your own im not sure what your physical problems are so that might be an issue but if you can get out it would be helpful  even on really bad days when i lived in the family home i always took the dogs out for a walk every afternoon and that really helped x i really think its worth a go independent living especially as you do have a supportive family to go back to if things didnt work out as well as youd hoped  pets are great company so its good to hear that youve got a little kitty to take with you    not sure who you have supporting you but i would chat with whoever handles your care and say its something youre considering you might be able to get some sort of supported or sheltered accommodation find out whats out there x i just tend to focus on the things i do like about my appearance and make the most of the good points this is something my mum kind of passed on to me she told me there was a point where the only thing she could think of that she liked about herself was her ankles because they were thin so she wore ankle bracelets  i think thats quite a good principle to take on there must be something even if its just one little thing that you like or at least accept about yourself  to be honest i used to be a bit like this then my attitude changed i gave up caring i realised that theres always someone willing to criticise no matter what you look like  so what difference does it make x wear a halter neck or something like that i think its about hiding the things you dont like and flaunting what you do like  for me i always get told that i have such a beautiful face and that im really pretty for a girl of my size  i know ive got nice hair nice teeth and occasionally i get compliments on my eyes so i wear clothes that are more flatteringcovering for my body and just make the most of whats there from the neck up lol x its good that you go to the dropin place  does mind or rethink run any services in your area or are they the ones you already go to  its so difficult when you dont have real life friends i do have friends but theyre all 1520 odd years older than me with their own children to look after cant exactly expect them to drop everything to come around for a cuppa  also even when you do eventually go out to actually get a lasting friendship and have the confidence to invite them over is difficult too   did you just not see a course that appealed to you or were there other issues transportcostetc  ive found that doing courses has helped me ive been doing pottery its come to an end now and i dont have any lasting friendships out of it but it really helped me just to be around people in a nonthreatening environment   i think thats a key thing for me being in a nonthreatening environment ive found my older friends through going to different spiritual groups like meditation classes and the like i dont know if thats something youre into or that goes on in your area  dont know what your beliefs are but maybe even church might give you some sense of community x i was going to ask you if something significant had happened around the time that you noticed this change you may not be able to make the link on a conscious level but i wouldnt be surprised if perhaps losing your father has had a lasting impact on your mental health perhaps therapy might help you explore your feelings a bit more and enable you to pinpoint whats causing this nervousness obviously what helps one person might not be so helpful to another but i do want to add that my social anxiety seems to improve without conscious effort whenever im taking citalopram antidepressant not that im saying you should do that but just saying whats helped me anyway if this is really impacting your life then id suggest getting in touch with a doctor or somebody who can point you in the right direction of getting some help x i think im the other way around if anything i get more alert and agitated at night x i know its a bit of a cliche but journalling and writing things down may be helpful   it doesnt matter if its not articulate or if your thoughts dont come out in a particular order just write whatevers in your head and then you can make sense of it later  with the comfort eating im not entirely sure what to suggest because i do it too   as you said its a relatively new thing youre struggling with i wonder if there was something else you were doing before that helped you that youre not doing now especially since you have a son to look after  for instance did you spent more time exercising did you pamper yourself did you do something creative  obviously youve got less time to yourself now so that must be having an impact   im just wondering if you can identify whats different from before that might have altered your way of coping x you could write what you eat but when i wrote that i meant generally keeping a diary of your thoughtsfeelings  you mustnt beat yourself up thinking youre letting your son down  of course you need to look after yourself so that youre in a better position to look after him but im sure youre doing an amazing job of raising him   i dont have any children but i would imagine that you might be fearful of being judged by reaching out and saying youre struggling a bit but is anybody around to help you take care of him you havent mentioned if his dads in the picture or not  im just wondering if you could have even an afternoon a week where someone looks after him for a bit someone you trust someone in your family or whatever so that you can have some time to recharge your batteries i think its important for parents to have that time for themselves i really do x its such a difficult decision to make medications are so potent even antidepressants that gps dish out like smarties  i can relate to just wanting to feel normal   personally im always on a merrygoround without the merry of initially feeling great on medication then feeling worse so then i stop them all and at first i feel great but unsurprisingly i come crashing down  both the improvement i get initially on meds and off meds never seems to last   obviously i dont know what youre taking but if youre on more than one medicine perhaps you could lower just one   do talk to your doctor about how youre feeling and see what they suggest take care x unfortunately i dont really think there is a way to change the feeling first i think that some days moods can be better than others and so its going to be easier to go out on a good day i can really relate to this scenario and lets just put it this way  ive waited months at a time to feel better before going out into the world  i think its about little steps too being realistic about what you feel able to do and not giving yourself a huge challenge sometimes its an achievement if ive forced myself to go to the library other times i feel inspired and go out for a walk just to be outside  sorry that thats not really much help its just my take on things and also just want you to know youre not on your own with what youre experiencing x youre not dying seriously   i sometimes think im dying god knows ive tried to die but alas i live to see another day x some antidepressants are prescribed for anxiety too so thats possibly why you handled things differently when you were on them i take citalopram which is an antidepressant but is also used for anxiety i do find that my social anxiety calms down somewhat when im on it im not fearful of speaking and can actually have a conversation now  it might be helpful to look up thinking distortions which includes catastrophising sometimes just identifying how your thoughts are skewed can be a helpful thing to do because it makes you aware that what youre thinking is not necessarily accurate or true x im no expert but id imagine that this probably is due to the alcohol did you notice these sleeping problems start when you gave up drinking or have they started since you started drinking again im not much of a drinker at all in fact over a year i think ill drink a maximum of 5 times on special occasions and when i do drink i have a hell of a time with my sleeping i wake up after only an hour or two and then find it hard to get back to bed if youre drinking more regularly then it wouldnt surprise me if this is what was causing your sleep pattern to go a bit funny at all  when you quit drinking were you supervised or did you get any advice from a doctor on how to quit or was it just a cold turkey thing it might be worth mentioning your situation to a doctor to see if they can recommend anything even if they cant help in terms of prescribing they might be able to give you some idea of how long you can expect this to go on for and what you can do to help yourself x someone will be taking over the contract but as youve not actually had the letter or forms to fill in for a reassessment id say youre safe until the new people come along which is supposedly in early 2015  i cant say this for sure but im sure ive read that theyre only going to be dealing with new claims and reassessments that are already in their system and not taking on anything new i sent off my form for a reassessment back in late november so i presume eventually theyll be getting in touch with me at some point but for somebody in your position id imagine youll be left alone until the new company come along whoever they are x i hope your doctor is helpful  have you been offered any help with dealing with the anxiety any booklets selfhelp advice cbt anything   you say camhs so im not too sure how old you are but when i was with camhs i was prescribed lorazepam which i still take now when im in a really bad way as far as i know they could prescribe you something like that though it has been 7 years since i was with camhs so the rules might have changed   i know its all a cliche but have you tried working on breathing techniques i know this sounds odd but i also find putting my hands on a flat surface like a kitchen counter or table can help me feel somewhat safer and more stable when i panic x i dont know about the drugs thing ive never really been around people who do drugs and have only had a handful of occasions where ive tried them had a really bad reaction to cannabis once must have been very strong  with the alcohol though perhaps you could drink in a calm safe environment i presume you go out to drink but it might be an idea to have nights in where you have a drink or two in front of the tvlistening to music or whatever aahh fcking facebook thats such a coincidence that youre experiencing this because this last week i have been massively triggered by things im seeing on facebook what is it thats affecting you are people talking about how wonderful their life is or is it other stuff for me i seem to be getting an increasing number of people sharing photos of animal abuse conspiracy stuff and just horrific news stories its understandably really affected my world view can you not unsubscribe or hide the things that are bothering you i understand what youre saying about the fact that theyre still going to be there reguardless of whether you can view it or not but it might be good to try that because itll be easier for you to put it out of your mind if you cant see whats upsetting you  your anxiety probably wont help you physically no what selfhelp techniques have you tried i know it can be so annoying when someone suggests listening to whales songs or taking a hot bath but sometimes it does take the edge off of things and help you relax  what support are you getting at the moment you said you hadhave depression what help did you get for that x i wonder if it might be helpful for you to see if womens aid offer any services in your area  even though you say youve left him they may still be able to offer outreach support counselling or put you in touch with some organisations where you can get support from people who either specialise in these things or have been through the same thing too   as toastedcrumpet says its definitely a good idea to see your gp too but id also suggest womens aid   im really sorry this happened it must have really shaken you up glad things are more stable in your outerlife now but obviously that doesnt change whats going on for you on the inside  x i have similar issues i am in a lot of pain recently ive been getting chest pain a lot went to the gp and nothing is physically wrong  dont under estimate what anxiety and stress can do to you physically sometimes ive been convinced im having a heart attack but its just an episode of anxiety my gp said that they can give you medication if palpitations were an issue but thats not really what bothers me i recently had an increase in citalopram which can help anxiety so there are meds that might help  just try not to worry i know its easier said than done but the more you stress about these aches and pains the more likely they are to feel worse x are you getting any professional support in helping you help yourself with your anxiety   i think youve already been given some good advice  the only things i can add that help me    deep breathing put your hands on a flat surface and take deep counted breaths when you exhale really blow out hard like youre trying to inflate a balloon and imagine that youre breathing out the tension  distraction i know this is a difficult one if youre already in a bit of a state but try and watch some tv look at a book do a crossword or something can help  put the radio on sometimes when im alone and my thoughts are beginning to drive me mad i put on the radio and try to find a station that has a lot of talking it feels like i have some kind of company and gives me some normal conversation to focus on  think of 5 things that are goodgoing wellyoure grateful formake you happy and keep chanting them over to yourself the other day i actually made myself laugh doing this so i think it can help   obviously these things only do so much and if youre really in the thick of it then its not so easy to do them x i think it might be worth trying to see a psychiatrist or perhaps a therapist might be helpful too  i can relate to getting angry over little things being out of place the way i see it is my brain and thoughts are so chaotic than when i see any chaos in my outer environment it just sends me spinning  obviously nobody here can diagnose you and i dont think i could anyway it sounds as if the social anxiety and selfesteem issues that you said you had in childhood has continued through to your adult life and is creating more and more problems  so yeah my advice to you would be to look up a psychiatrist but to also consider trying to get therapycounselling because i think it might help you to talk x hey welcome to the forum its sounds to me like its due to tiredness especially as youre experiencing it when you need to rest or are about to go to sleep  lack of sleep is so bad for health  not that im trying to preach what im saying is i dont sleep well so i know from first hand experience how bad it can be sometimes i feel like im extremely drunk when ive not slept enough  i would say its just another symptom of the overall situation youre got of dealing with anxiety and being really tired try not to worry to much about it as im sure your counsellor would be concerned if it was something serious am glad that youre finding your cbt helpful and starting to notice an improvement x yeah i get this sometimes its a regular thing and other times i can go for a while without experiencing it it seems to be very out of the blue i dont think its anything serious i think its probably where your muscles relax as you go to sleep but because part of your mind is awake it goes into a bit of a panic and kind of jolts you what position do you sleep in apparently it makes a difference to this kind of thing x im not necessarily convinced that you are acting weaker than you actually are  it certainly sounds to me like you have depression have you been prescribed any medication for it  also you say youre going to therapy  what kind of therapy are you having  obviously even though you were very anxious during your time with the armed forces it sounded like you managed to get by even if it was with difficulty im sure as well that you had to be very strong in that situation i wonder if now youre away from that you feel youre choosing to be weak because youre not necessarily being challenged   reguardless my point is that i dont think you should label yourself as being weak or lazy or give yourself stick for not being well  the overanalysing thing is very difficult i struggle with it a lot and so i know how out of hand it can get what doesnt help is when i dont keep myself busy or focused on something   if im not using my brain then my brain will start to create things to think about to make itself useful keeping busy can be helpful even if its just by reading or doing crosswords because if im focused on something else im not torturing myself by overanalysing what i said to someone last week   how long have you been having therapy by the way x aww sorry that things arent all that great for you   you are trying really hard and you are doing really well dont hesitate to reach out and get any additional support that you may need i can imagine that it may feel like taking steps back and that must be frustrating and upsetting but if youre noticing the warning signs then in theory at least acting soon should help nip things in the bud before they turn into a full on crisis situation   by the way have you ever tried a green facial primer heres one from boots i know its not cheap but still  no7 colour calming primer green 40ml  boots  im really not a make up kind of a girl myself but putting some of that on my face is very cooling i cant say the difference visually is amazing but it does help cover up redness and blushing  i find when i wear it it helps i think that also because i feel the makeups covering up the redness when i feel myself blush i dont freak out about it obviously thats a good thing the worst thing about blushing is the more aware you are of it the worse it gets  x yeah i can relate  ill go one step further and say that sometimes when im really in a bad place i hate people looking at me recently i was really stressed out and agitated i had to go to the supermarket and i swear peoples looks just felt so invasive i just wanted to shout fuck off and stop looking at me really loud  i cant explain it really they were only going about their business and it was probably just a passing glance and if they were starting at me it was more than likely because i was glaring at them first but it was like they were psychically suffocating me with their eyes yes im a nutter  i think its just a selfprotective thing as bothersome as it can be when you feel yourself getting anxious or agitated its your brains strange way of creating boundaries x thanks for your response crumpet  i know what you mean about the blood sugar thing i used to get that a lot especially when i was taking antipsychotics quetiapine and risperidone used to make me have a low blood sugaranxiety attack but this feels different to that ill just have to take it to my therapist or care coordinator cant remember who im seeing soonest x ok well basically every now and then i get this horrible experience that comes very out of the blue  first of all i start to feel very sick and think im about to vomit  and then ill start to cry its like a cry that makes me want to whinge its unbearable  and my thoughts are usually like i dont want to be alive  and then i have to breathe deep breaths i pretend that im blowing up a balloon strong inhale and strong exhale i have to hold onto or lean against a surface like my kitchen counter eventually after a minute or two it stops   the reasons why i doubt theyre panic attacks are i dont feel like im going to die or that im under threat i feel like i want to die i dont get the shakes with it   the reasons i think they are panic attacks are they come on outoftheblue its a physical sensation that comes on first and then come the horrible thoughts i feel an extreme sense of urgency in body and mind and also i feel unreal   yes i know nobody here can diagnose me but im just wondering if anybody experiences anything similar does this sound like a panic attack x sometimes there are no answers i know thats not much comfort but there are sick people out there who will target anybody the loss of your friend must have really shaken you up do you have any other mutual friends it might help for you to talk to someone else who knew him and feels as shocked as you do do you live alone or with parents if you live with other people  are they aware of whats gone on and are they supportive sounds to me like you really need to be kind and look after yourself im sure its normal to go through what youre feeling though i cant imagine myself because im lucky that not many people ive known have died x is an internship similar to an apprenticeship do you get fully paid or is your training considered part of the payment for your time sorry im not quite sure what an internship is  there is absolutely no shame in making a mistake there is no shame in asking questions if you dont understand theres no shame in needing someone so show you how to do something several times over just to make sure you understand  i just wanted to say that because its completely natural to have these kinds of anxieties  people will be understanding and forgiving of your mistakes because theyll know that whatever it is youre doing is a new experience im sure youre willing to learn and are a good listener i know its not much help me saying youll be fine but always in my experience the thought of doing something along these lines is way scarier than actually doing it x if this has only occurred since your coworkers death then this could be a result of that maybe on some level your mind has thoughts that life is fragile and can be taken from you at any time etc i think someone has said that most fears ultimately are a fear of dying like with the flying its probably not the flying youre afraid of its the thought of having a crash the chances of something going wrong on your flight are something like 11 million to one ive read a statistic somewhere that youre more likely to die because of a donkey attacking you than in a plane im glad the zoloftsertraline seems to be helping you a bit as for the xanax im not sure that thats even available in the uk so not sure what its like to take but its a benzodiazepine so it should help you it will probably send you to sleep to be honest im sure you will feel like yourself again it just sounds like youre having a bit of a mental health crisis and could do with some talking therapy to help you move past this fear of death that youre having i hope your psychologist can make some helpful recommendations  im not really sure what advice i can give but i just wanted to reassure you that things will be fine and that it sounds like the medication youre taking is a good idea for the time being x i think falling sky has a point its worth contacting these friends and asking if everythings ok if they say something hurtful which is unlikely then at least you know where you stand when you have anxiety its easy to imagine the worst case scenario and think that they might not like youyouve done something to upset them etc it might just be that they know youre shy and so they presume that inviting you to a lively party might not be your thing be brave and talk to them youll feel better for it and wont be left wondering whats wrong x hey i had to check your previous posts is the person youre fearful of your former flatmate or have i got the wrong end of the stick  as for your question i think its normal to some extend for people to wonder what happens after you die and to have existential questions however it seems to have triggered off a lot of anxiety for you as well as the social situation youre in who do you see for your mental health are you in contact with any of the services  i didnt quite see the beginning of your story but if youre in danger of people wanting to get hold of you for whatever reason could you not phone the police x ah i really understand how you feel i think of all the symptoms i have depersonalisation is by far one of the most difficult to cope with  have you had your blood pressure checked  a couple of weeks ago i had a major episode of depersonalisation i mean i always have it but this was utterly scary i went to see an outofhours gp because it was a weekend and i was panicking so much i couldnt stand to wait until the monday  anyway she checked me over and it turned out that i did have low blood pressure  in an odd way i was relieved because at least there was something tangible to prove or explain how out of it i was feeling   ive just realised that ive responded to another thread of yours  i really think you need to see a doctor about your anxietydepression im not trying to sound insulting like omg you need help i can just tell youre really struggling and even just a little bit of help is better than struggling on your own  it sounds like youve battled with this by yourself long enough xx the earth itself i believe is a separate entity mother earth will survive anything its humanity that may end through itsour own stupidity    it is helpful to adjust your own thought patterns around it  my anxiety isnt around the world ending because i know it wont end but it can and probably will change drastically im putting my hopes and prayers out there that it will be a positive change  i get anxious about the state of chaos that may come whilst the way things currently are no longer works the bottom line is i fear what people may do to one another to survive but i have faith that there are others out there who will show kindness and compassion because thats what i try to practice myself   thanks for the thread anyway peacewithin i do like your posts  x its really frustrating when people dont listen to you isnt it do you have an advocacy service available to you what do your friends and family think about you do they think youre ill maybe you could get the help of somebody close to you to go to the people who are suggesting you go into hospital and explain that you dont want to go there how do you feel about people saying youre schizophrenic do you relate to any of the criteria sorry if im asking loads of questions i can just see youre upset and want to help x i kind of want to print this off and stick it on my wall  i dont know if you were just writing what what on your mind but this could almost be a poem very wise and lovely words hey how are you doing now i think sleep deprivation plays a huge factor in these sorts of things youre not rested your brain is probably exhausted and so your body is probably making you take short breaths to increase the oxygen to your brain so that it can function better when i dont sleep well this happens to me too i also get ridiculous heart palpitations suddenly i go a little bit deaf and all i can hear is my heart suddenly thumping fast and loud i hope you get some good nights sleep soon i really think itll help you feel better if it doesnt then it might be worth getting checked out as belmont suggested x having a really bad time of it at the moment  i am really anxious and dont feel present at all i dont even know what reality is  anyone seen inception the film yeah its like that wheres my spinning top obviously on one level i know im not dreaming but everything is lacking in dimension   waiting for a call back dialed nhs direct i cant really handle what im feeling any more  i swear somethings wrong with my brain but isnt that what anxietypanic can do  make you convinced youre dying  i cant feel my limbs my eyesight is blurry im dizzy   you know what the most depressing thought is in all of this  i live alone if i were to literally drop dead this second it would be a good few days before anyone would notice it would probably be my mum who phones me to check if im ok now and then nobody else really sees me i dont have contact with anybody else regularly enough for them to know something was up   i dont want to be living alone i never wanted to live alone and this is precisely why im either dying or am going insane and nobodys around to anchor me and help me feel in this reality  i could just float away   sorry for the depressing post im not really looking for advice just trying to distract myself waiting for a call back i phoned 4 and a half hours ago made another phone call an hour and a half ago still nothing someone from nhs direct im going to see outofhours gp at 7pm hopefully they can help me out xx thanks guys for your support  the gp checked me over said my blood pressure was low but there was nothing physically wrong with me i suppose that was good reassurance  i just cant get over what mental health and anxiety can do to you physically so many times ive thought to myself no this is beyond anxiety now something is really wrong with me and im going to die chest pains unbearable headache etc etc    my family dynamic is a different story altogether after seeing the gp i popped into my parents house although within 10 minutes i felt like walking out of the door i did get a nice hug from mum and a lovely bit of dinner and got to make a fuss over my doggies too  so that helped bring me back into reality a bit xx   and dont worry andy you didnt depress me at all it can be a depressing situation being so isolated youre welcome to pm me too anytime x anxiety is horrible its not my main diagnosis but my diagnosis includes with significant anxiety complaints it sounds like its still early days in terms of treatment correct me if im wrong it takes a long time to find the right medication for you and when you do sometimes it just stops working its a pain in the arse i think with anxiety it is as much about changing your thought processes as it is medication mind you having so little sleep cant be helping you at all you have my sympathy there have you been offered any talking therapies yet  as far as daytoday advice goes the sort of things ive found helpful are breathing exercises i have a fan at my bedside table that i switch on so i get fresh air when im lying in bed it really helps to take in some deeper more relaxing breaths i also have a nature sounds album my favourite tracks are ocean sounds and theres another one which is the sound of a stream with birdsong ive read somewhere might even have been a link on here from somebody that listening to nature sounds for 2 hours a day i know thats a lot and i dont do that much can reduce the symptoms of stress by about 50 distraction techniques are always useful whether its art or doing a crossword although you have to be able to concentrate somewhat chamomile tea really helps me i was a bit skeptical about it at first but for me personally it has a really noticeable effect aromatherapy is good too  lavender oil baths etc  its just about finding some relaxation techniques that work for you hope you find some relief it sounds like what your experiencing is really horrible xx as stanogden said its a free webcame based chat thing you can chose to type to one another with webcam on or if you have the snazzy equipment you can talk i suppose the only way he could see into your eyes would be if you started directly at the camera otherwise hell just see you looking at the screen x ok so you have some sleeping pills to help are you on any regular daytime meds the trouble with sleeping pills is the body builds up resistance pretty quick and they arent as effective its frustrating ive been there too many times what can help me is a nice hot bath and a cup of tea in the bath if the waters hot i find it helps me to take deeper breaths and breath work is essential in dealing with anxiety another thing that helps me is to do some activity that requires your brain to be used and it helps you to not think so much i keep a book of puzzles you know the ones that contain all types of things from sudoku to crosswords i keep it on my bedside table and do a puzzle when i cant sleep because im focusing on that it really helps to occupy my mind another thing is to keep a jotter and note your thoughts down until you get bored of writing yes it most absolutely would be classed as trauma  it sounds to me like you may well be suffering from ptsd im not a doctor obviously but you would really benefit from seeing one rollercoaster what is your current living situation who are you living with is your halfbrother within a close distance to you im quite concerned for your welfare  it might be an idea to also contact womens aid also domestic abuse doesnt just happen between couples it happens between family members too they could offer you any support you might need from counselling to a place in a refuge where you can start a new life hey nikki sorry to hear youre doing through such a difficult time   i dont get thoughts of harming anybody other than myself but i feel so surreal and like the world is some sort of hologram that i feel utterly insane  my thoughts are more around vandalism lol seriously i feel like because theres no substance or weight to the world around me i could smash up anything  a car a shop window my own face  and it wouldnt be real  have you ever seen the inception i kind of feel like the woman dicaprios wife in the film who jumps out of the window because she feels like shes in a dreamworld kind of feel like a i need a spinning top to remind myself that im here   you just have to really keep reminding yourself that this is real you are in reality it may be fuzzy but youre here   recently ive wondered if the amount of time i spend in front of a screen tv laptop mobile etc is contributing to this feeling that im not here and things arent real  as from tomorrow im going to make a real effort to go for a walk once a day if the weather allows im going to take off my shoes and really try to feel the earth around me  sometimes just touching your own body no not like that  can help you to feel physical and anchored in the world give yourself a foot massage or buy one of those body brushes and use it having more body awareness and sensation on your skin can help a lot the skin of course is the bodys natural boundary and so it can help you establish where you and your psyche ends and where the real world begins   as for meds it really might help you i agree that when you first start them things do feel a bit strange but you will get used to them its a small price to pay if it helps you in the long run ha what a coincidence i was listening to their 1hr ocean waves sleep video only last night  has anybody else here tried binaural beats you have to have headphones to listen to them its music in which a different frequency comes out of each earphone it stiumulates the brainwaves and it has a really soothing effect supposedly i havent explained it really that well but if anybodys interested check out the link sleep music relax  delta binaural waves meditation  relaxation  youtube i suffer with anxiety but dont take oxactin and so i cant really relate to your experience or tell you how the meds work  but if you ever want to chat im all ears or should i say eyes   really hope you start to feel better soon and welcome to the forum ok so i think youre going through a combination of depression and anxiety the two can feed off of eachother which can leave someone in a right mess with all due respect it sounds like youre really feeling like your heads a mess at the moment  the best thing you can do is visit your doctor there is nothing to be scared of the sooner you make the appointment and go about getting the help you need the better because if you leave things they could escalate and you could end up becoming quite unwell there is help out there for you its bloody hard work at times but you can turn things around when you speak to your doctor tell them everything youre experiencing its also worth mentioning that your mum has been unwell when you were little because some mental health issues can be hereditary not always but if you have a gene and your environmental factors arent great then it makes you far more prone to becoming ill  be kind to yourself value yourself and speak to your doc oh no its nothing like being sectioned or taken to some facility dont worry intervention is just a word they use for getting involved in your treatment they are intervening and thank you to google p the definition is  come between so as to prevent or alter a result or course of events  they are trying to prevent you from getting to the point where you need to go into hospital  i hope they help you and that you start to feel better soon sounds like youre having a hard time dealing with whats going on in your mind and the results that that has on your body must be really draining to be going through that absolutely im sure this is something that is probably a major factor in your anxiety i dont know what the secret is obviously but if you say its making you ashamed and guilty then its obviously got a big hold on you it must be affecting how you view yourself as a person your selfesteem and that will be having a knockon effect on how you relate to other people  im sure youre going to guess that i think this is something you should talk about with someone do you have access to any counselling services confidentiality is a major part of their job role and so you can trust them not to reveal your secret to anybody make sure you go before you take him out im sure the worryanxiety will only make your crohns worse not that i suffer from it its just what ive heard where do you walk your dog is there a toilet nearby if it was urgent when my sa was really bad and i was asked to do any kind of survey for whatever reason i used to hate it because due to the sa i couldnt find people to actually ask anyway if i can be helpful heres my response   1 do you think slim women can and do look attractive and feminine if not why not yes i think they do and can be attractive and feminine of course nobody is going to please everyone all of the time and people have their own idea of beauty but generally speaking yes they can be attractive and femininity comes from within its not always about wearing floaty skirts  2 what would you think of someone whose body is not perfect that theyre real my body is not perfect even the women who seem to fit the mainstream ideal arent perfect theres a lot of airbrushing that goes on and this makes peoples expectations unrealistic  3 what would you consider the perfect body type to be and do you think there is a perfect body type i dont think there is a perfect body type as long as youre breathing and your hearts beating your body is perfect 4 what do you think of slim women well automatically i thought theyre lucky but i dont think thats necessarily the case to be slim is whats considered attractive by most but of course there are downsides to every body type as i said previously other peoples expectations are unrealistic 5what would you think of a person who is quiet in a conversation im usually that person but when i notice it in others it doesnt bother me at all i understand what it is to be the quiet one ive always been told that the empty cargos make the loudest noise and so the quietness means that your cargo is full  6 if a person does not seem to have knowledge on a topic being discussed in conversation what would you think of them  in a way it pleases me to be able to teach them something new i enjoy passing on knowledge to others knowledge isnt something to be kept secret and turned into power its to be shared among everyone  hope your cbt goes well and start to feel some improvement just take care of yourself too yeah   either way whatever you decide to do  dont hurt yourself any more than is really necessary i know it sounds like hippy dippy bullshit but you need to love yourself because you deserve to be loved oh gosh thats awful for you  are you on any medication at the moment or seeing a professional im wondering if theres something they could give you at night so that you wont wake up feeling as bad as you do  because its really not a common thing i dont want to say normal thing to feel like that when you wake up  its bound to affect your whole day if youre waking up feeling like this and you shouldnt have to live like that hey i have bpd and anxiety too is your partner aware of your issues and how they affect the way that you interact with her sometimes even if you have already had a conversation like that perhaps you need to explain that youre really worried about losing her and that youre sorry that your bpd causes you to act in certain ways  obviously its not the right thing to keep looking for reassurance from her because at the end of the day any assurance you need should come from yourself  have you been offered or are you getting any help for your bpd from a mental health team because unless youre being taugh strategies for dealing with it then its bound to be an ongoing thing perhaps you should also find some selfhelp books ive got some great ones relating to bpd that are really helpful ah theres nothing worse than leaving a meeting with any mental health professional and feeling worse than when you walked in has she not communicated with your specialist have you asked her why shes decided to give you a different diagnosis  it must be really frustrating for you and im sure there must be a part of you that never wants to go and see her again but if shes your only source for help  then eventually youre going to need to see her again how often are your appointments at the moment maybe you should give yourself a little bit of time to reflect on things and work out what you would like to say to her ie you dont feel her diagnosis is correct or helpful and thats shes completely ignored the cptsd diagnosis that sometimes you feel like she doesnt understand you be totally honest as well and tell her that sometimes you dont feel shes listening to you and that her reaction to your talking is patronisingjudgemental  obviously i dont know what shes like but in one of my worst episodes i was a right bitch to my psychiatrist told her she was wrong asked her how many patients of her patients had killed themselves asked her if she bought her degree certificate from ebay and after a few months i got better and went back and apologised she was really pleasant about it and actually said she was just happy to see me better so its not impossible to fix a relationship with a psychiatrist right i didnt realise shed been saying things like this to you when i suggested going back to see her in a while  i think youd be doing the right thing by staying away from her how come you were made to go and see her in the first place was your specialist away ive been told by my psychiatrist that lorazepam is good for getting to asleep but not keeping you asleep and as you probably know its easy to become dependant on it and youll need more to get the same effect but i dont see why you shouldnt take it once in a while if youre having a bad time of it sorry youre having a bad time at the moment selfharm is a tricky one ive gone for years without doing it and then suddenly life all gets too much and ive done it again the trick is not to be hard on yourself  its a coping mechanism when you took an overdose were you suicidal or just wanted to selfharm that may sound like a silly question but taking an overdose doesnt always mean someone wants to die  i think maybe you should be more trusting and open up to the professionals as you said theyve always been against sectioning you in the past tell them that thats not what you want to be honest psych wards are overflowing and they dont want to put people in them yeah selfharm is more about keeping yourself alive than it is wanting to die like i said in another thread dont give yourself a hard time about it until youve learned or found other coping mechanisms youre doing the best you can i think it might be a good idea to write things down that way youre clear on what you want to express at the end of the day theyre there to help and you should take advantage of that fact  do you have any idea of what you want to happen i know my carecoordinator sometimes asks is there something we can offer you that you dont already have it might be an idea to think about what you might like in future whether its therapy or access to local social groups for people struggling with mh issues sounds like your anxiety causes you to overthink massively i could be wrong but i feel like that might be whats going on for you youre so worried and overanalysing everything that youre going around in circles and tripping yourself up  i really hope i dont leave you feeling disappointed when i say this and im sure you already know this yourself but the only person who can stop this worrying is you and i know its not easy its not like theres a switch you can flick on and off  but you know in your heart that you both love eachother and that neither of you are guilty of anything you just have to train your brain into knowing it too   out of curiosity what help have you recieved for your anxiety in the past honestly i dont know if social services would get involved or not ive not got kids or any experience with them i would imagine that they would only ever really get involved if someone felt that your child was at risk in any way from the sounds of what youre experiencing i dont see that there would be any cause for concern in that way  its not as if you hear a voice telling you to hurt your child you dont sound at all violent or prone to outbursts of anger im sure social services wouldnt waste their time  they have far more important cases to worry about im sorry i dont know a great deal but i just wanted to reply and tell you that i dont think you have anything to worry about youre not awful  i can completely 100 understand where youre coming from  i think even someone who hasnt had the traumatic experiences that youve had in the past might feel uncomfortable in that situation  has he ever done that before or done anything else to make you feel uncomfortable why did he hug you were you just saying hellogoodbye or did you say something that might make him believe you were upset at all im just wondering if theres a reason for him to have been more tactile than usual  it could be that he didnt realise he was doing it it could be that it was accidental not that im defending him at all its just difficult to know whether it was intentional or not  if i were you id give him the benefit of the doubt for now as long as it was a oneoff and if he were to do that again id either seriously think about what i would say to him eg im not comfortable with you touching me like that are you aware thats what youre doing or think about telling somebody in your family or your husband how youre feeling   that advice might not suit you and im sorry if it doesnt   you are very entitled to feel like you dont want to give him the benefit of the doubt hes obviously triggered off some painful memories im just saying what i would do it must be difficult for you because yes you probably are more sensitive to whats appropriate contact and whats not but that doesnt mean that what you feel is invalid you shouldnt have to endure something youre not comfortable with because its whats expected of you is there a way that you can make the hug shorter or perhaps hug with one arm and have your body facing away from him if you get what i mean  you really arent stupid and none of what has happened to you is your fault i know thats easy for me to say but other people wouldnt ever judge you as harshly as you judge yourself satnavs are wonderous inventions and once youve made the first journey you and mum will be familiar with the route so it will make things easier its always scary to start any kind of treatment but counselling can really make a difference to peoples lives i completely hear that youre worried and its understandable but itll turn out fine just you wait and see my diagnosis is a personality disorder with significant anxiety so while i dont have an anxiety disorder as such it is something i deal with on a daily basis personally it does sound like you have anxiety as sarah said if its affecting your quality of life and it sounds like it is then its worth seeing a psychiatrist i dont know what country you live in or how your health system works but as you said you would have to shell out money to see a psych im guessing you have control over how often you might see one what im saying is i think you should go for a consultation with one for a single session if its not at all helpful then you dont have to commit i hear you im a complete weener when it comes to the dark   it obviously helps to have the light on when youre asleep so dont give yourself a hard time about it as mentioned above there are older people that are scared of the dark too theres really no shame in it also sleep is so vital to your mental health you need to be rested to even have a chance of feeling well so anything that can make you sleep better is worth doing do you make a conscious decision to start staring or do you find that it just happens also do you find you do it when youre particularly under stress or can it happen whenever i dont think its a medical issue with your eyes sounds to me like its more of a coping mechanism your brain has like its taking mini breaks to make you feel better it could also be dissociation as mentioned which is itself a coping mechanism perhaps you could read up on it and see if you can relate\n",

      "doc: im not sure if what youre experiencing is common when taking prozac or not i suppose it could be more to do with the withdrawing of effexor  how long have you been on the prozac for now if youre still experiencing stiff and trembling muscles and clenched jaw i would contact your psychiatrist mainly to make sure that its not a bad reaction to the prozac which ever med its down to the symptoms youve described sound rather unpleasant so id definitely find out if its what your psychiatrist would consider a common reaction  i wish you well hi and welcome to the forum   you have got so much going on in your life at the moment that even a person without anxiety would struggle i cant give you answers but i can tell you youre not alone and that others here will understand some of what youre going through keep posting if it helps we all have to reach out at some time or another and sharing your thoughts and worries really can help i get it with answering phone calls i hate it when the phone rings and have disabled my answering machine and my providers answering service so that nobody can leave a message on my home phone this said im more than happy to text or email  i dont know the best way to overcome this do you have a friend or family member with whom you could practice for want of a better word instantly texting and emailing you could do it while in the same room as that person so that they can encourage you it might sound silly but i was just thinking along the lines of desensitisation also i often find the more i do something the easier it becomes hi cuddlybear and welcome to the forum   ive not experienced this but im aware that gad can affect you both mentally and physically i would imagine that the tension and aches are tied in with feeling on edge perhaps you are tensing your muscles more when feeling this way its just a thought  hopefully others who have experience with this issue will come along with a more helpful response  take care hi guybrush and welcome to the forum  sorry to hear of your worries and the impact its now having on your relationship i think it would be worth trying a counsellor or therapist it could help with your obsessional thinking and perhaps having that alloted time to talk about it would alleviate some of the need to go through it over and over with your girlfriend  i wondered too as you talk about a timeline that you keep trying to work out if actually creating a timeline on your computer assuming you have one or something similar might help im thinking along the lines of creating a document that you can save and add to as you remember things that your girlfriend can access if she feels the need to you could make the past an unspoken subject and do it all via your computer  i hope that makes sense every time you feel the need to discuss or disclose something you can go to your pc and type it all out you would know then that you wouldnt need to tell your girlfriend as if she wanted to know she could look at your timeline  it might sound like a silly idea but at the moment its the best i can manage i agree with the other responses here i think itll be a bit of a wait and see type thing  perhaps the colleague has experienced this personally and is just giving a warning of what they think will happen of course this doesnt mean that it will definitely happen to you on the other hand it may be a rumour started by a disgruntled member of staff who didnt like the manager in the first place there are many scenarios that could have led to this comment  i wouldnt worry about it just carry on as you are it sounds as though youre doing really well at work and that you get on with your manager sorry youre feeling like this flowerpot it sounds as though you have a lot to deal with and that youre at the end of your tether im sorry that i havent got any specific advice for you i just wanted you to know that someone else is here  with the mental health services i think youre right on both  too many ill and not enough staffservices to cope with it all i dont know that it matters how loud you shout  you wont make anyone low by sharing your worries and issues were all here to support each other so vent as you need to i hope things get easier for you hi miss chaos77 and welcome to the forum  ive not taken cipralex before so cant help with that specifically but as somersetscorpio said most side effects will improve within time i think i went through the worst of it for about a month with my meds but still get a couple that have stayed with me over the years  sometimes it just comes down to a case of weighing up the pros and cons just keep an eye on it and if the side effects become too bothersome talk to your gp about it  im glad the cipralex is helping with your anxiety and hope that the side effects ease soon i dont think that this is necessarily a bad thing or should be viewed negatively i had to go through the dreaded medicalinterview which was awful the only person i know who didnt need a medical actually received a decision in their favour obviously i cant offer consolation based on just one person but i hope it goes a little towards making you feel more relaxed  waiting for a result is probably the worst part but as cpuusage says if you get a decision that you believe is wrong then appeal  i hope you hear back soon with a good result when were suffering there doesnt have to be a reason and if we cant understand how or why were feeling a certain way those closest often get caught in the crossfire for want of a better expression  please dont consider self medicating and please reconsider seeing your doctor again i know how difficult it can be to face them and really if you are not finding himher sympathetic then would it possible to change doctors you shouldnt have to be going through this with no extra support but that will mean opening up i wouldnt know possibly the issue i see is using any drugs psychotropic or otherwise unless theyve been prescribed for you i just wouldnt go there  i really think you have to push past your phobias and worries and stress to your doctor how you are suffering dont be fobbed of with unhelpful comments and dont worry if you feel as though you shouldnt be persevering with it we are all deserving of help and support but have to sometimes muster all our strength to get started youre bound to be scared i think any of us would feel the same i do hope all goes well and your surgery is a success its a completely sad and soul destroying joke isnt it the entire process is so longwinded and seems to be aimed at causing suffering to those who need the most help i despair i hope you manage to get the answers you need tomorrow do let us know how you get on im so glad that the call was more positive than expected and that you are now feeling some relief hearing the result before christmas would be great i hope you can manage to relax a little fingers crossed for you please try not to feel too guilty look at it as a break that is much needed at the present you are worth so much more than what you can provide for your family and im sure they want whats best for you and just want you feeling better  i dont think any of it seems silly being cheated on in the past is bound to effect your selfesteem and can have a lasting impact on your life if you wont go back to the doctors sooner then maybe try looking at your two weeks off as time and space to think about what help you need and to start writing down some of your main concerns  if youre feeling no better after the two weeks go back to your doctor with whatever youve jotted down and talk things through with him a good doctor can make all the difference but he cant help you properly if youre not open with him thank you i hope youve had a good day too its great that youre still not drinking and that youre feeling better during the day night times can be some of the hardest and loneliest to cope with but were here to help if possible  im glad that youve decided to go back to your doctor if you need to i know personally that putting off getting help when you really need it is one of the worst things you can do  good luck with your progress hi lollipop75  ive nothing much to add to the good advice already given but i do understand how you feel and some of what youre going through i just wanted to say a quick hello and welcome you to the forum i think that most of us here can probably relate to your issues to some degree or another i have made and lost friends over the years some of it due to isolating myself at times and some because of my erratic behaviour    you should have no problems making friends here and while perhaps no substitute for real life friends it would get you back in to communicating with others and can be used as an outlet for sharing your thoughts and feelings without having to feel self conscious i wish you well   by the way welcome to the forum ive only just read this thread  i was wondering why you hadnt been around lately   i do hope youre feeling better than you were and just want to wish you a speedy recovery oh yahtzee sorry to hear of your struggles and that you feel so alone unfortunately many mental health illnesses and disorders go hand in hand with isolation andor feelings of loneliness  are you receiving any help or treatment for your depression or anxiety  by the way welcome to the forum i hope that being part of it will help you to feel less alone thats not good i would imagine thats putting you off seeing anyone again for a while do you think youd be able to cope with a talking therapy such as cbt i suppose its difficult at times to know what will make you feel better and what makes things worse that sounds like a good plan i hope youre feeling stronger and more stable soon particularly at home perhaps talk about how youre feeling with your family they might think that theyre helping and may be totally unaware that things have become worse  take care my daughters partner uses a light box though im not certain of the make hes found it very effective for sad theyve also replaced their living room light bulbs with daylight ones   several people at my bipolar support group also recommend replacing light bulbs and have found it very helpful i personally find them too bright and as with foxjo they give me headaches   everyones different but it might be worth giving it a try nothing ventured and all that by the way welcome to the forum hi bethamyy and welcome to the forum  i would say if you feel as though you need help with your issues yes go see your gp   we cant say whats wrong with you to use your expression but we can hopefully offer support and maybe advice  if you feel awkward or anxious about what to say to your doctor why dont you print out your above post and hand it to them to read it explains what youre going through very well sorry to hear that youre still feeling so anxious about your friend and her other friend i responded to one of your previous threads about the same thing and can only reiterate what i said then  i really dont know what your friend can do to reassure you any more than she already has perhaps you just need to prepare yourself for their return you know how hard its going to be for you so maybe try to come up with some coping strategies to help get you through whilst your friend tells you about her time away   it might be a good idea to avoid facebook for a while too it sounds as though facing it might be too stressful perhaps think about taking up a new hobby or interest to distract yourself  i hope that you find some way to ease your anxiety over this  take care and a good name it is too i like it its pants feeling used and unappreciated by people in your life perhaps after a time they will realise how much you do for them and it will be possible to have a more even relationship that said sometimes for your own sanity the only thing you can do is break ties  i hope youre okay because your operation coincided with you leaving school and then starting college its hard to tell if thats where your problems originated perhaps it was a combination of events  i think that understanding whether youre just a natural worrier or if there is an underlying anxiety issue comes down to a matter of severity and how you cope if your worries adversely impact your life and effect your daytoday living then its wise to seek help i know this isnt as easy to decide as it sounds   you were obviously worried enough to seek help on here so maybe thats a sign that you do need some support with what youre going through  calypsos suggestions of counselling and mindfulness are definitely worth looking in to there is a lot of helpful information on the internet too  i hope you start feeling better soon hi  sorry you are feeling this way your friend has reassured you that nothing will come between you and if you value your friendship you have to trust that   just because she has another friend who sounds as though she really needs support at the moment it doesnt mean that youre forgotten pushed out or not important  also whether this other girl wants to be best friends with your best friend or not is totally irrelevant having new or other friends doesnt make our relationships with existing friends any different we have the capacity for many people in our lives  it does seem as though you are taking a huge interest in your best friends life instead of concentrating on your own life and happiness perhaps try to focus instead on what you like and enjoy doing  i hope you feel better about things soon i know its not easy to let things go when anxiety kicks in hi ldigi1 and welcome to the forum  it does sound anxiety related particularly as his tests came back clear and he checks his blood pressure and heart rate several times a day its so easy to slip in to habits that get a bit out of control and become almost obsessive before we know it  im just wondering if some of his symptoms are caused by his medication has he discussed how hes feeling with his doctor if hes taking klonopin for his anxiety it doesnt sound as though its working too well perhaps a change of meds or dose is needed i dont know i personally think that for anxiety talking therapies help more than just medication  perhaps your boyfriend needs to go back to his doctor and tell him that the medication is not working and that he needs more help and support   although it shouldnt be the case i think doctors will take more notice if someone goes in with the patient to stress how bad things are would you be able to go to the doctors with him hi megan and welcome to the forum  i think part of what you are experiencing is quite normal youre bound to have certain thoughts and emotions about your husbands ex she caused some issues but your husband as you say yourself was also naive and basically did as she said she also still has a connection with him as she has his children  you seem to view her though as someone who has everything sorted which is highly unlikely and someone who you wish you were or would aspire to be she might appear strong confident and happy to you but basically shes just another person with her own worries troubles and insecurities as we all are has your mini obsession with her got worse since you and your husband hit a rocky patch is it related at all  i think the first thing to do would be to stop looking at her facebook page easier said than done i know if you cant avoid facebook altogether then every time you get the urge to check her page out do something else every time you start thinking about her do something different to distract yourself   if you start taking little steps you should hopefully find that more and more time goes between thinking of her until shes not such a big part of your life i dont think anyone will be offended by your post also i think being scared that you cant get well is a common fear fortunately you have motivation which will hopefully keep you going  having mh problems certainly doesnt make parenting a breeze when my children were very young i did what i could to hide everything i was going through from them they just thought mummy got ill a lot and as they grew older i explained in very basic terms what was happening i was lucky enough to have a very supportive family too  having children changes the way you view everything or it did for me all of a sudden the most important people in the world were these two little babies i had twins who were totally dependent on me my responsibilities changed immediately and thoughts of myself apart from staying well were pushed to the back of the queue  just put everything youve got in to getting better a lot of this will be trial and error but youll find something that works eventually the next step is then discovering which coping tools and strategies work to keep you well  i hope that helps a little if you have any specific questions i dont mind having a go at answering them hi kelly  a belated hello and welcome to the forum  i hope all goes well with your appointment tomorrow let us know how you get on hi evolutionarysleeper and welcome to the forum  sorry to hear youre going through such a bad time  i think if youre going to see your doctor you should be as open as possible theyre not going to be able to get a true picture of things unless you tell them as much as you can im pretty sure they wont cart you off in a straightjacket  im sure your mum and dad dont think bad things about you it sounds as though they care and are trying to be supportive   i dont think youre a monster to me you sound like someone whos confused experiencing odd thoughts and wants a bit of help  let us know how youre appointment goes  i wish you well its weird isnt it almost like we have to accept or allow ourselves certain liberties so that we can cope with them without feeling bad  i was the same a while back along with my depressive episodes came terrible guilt for sleeping too much it wasnt until my psychiatrist explained that after a high i needed the extra sleep for my body and mind to recuperate that i felt better about it  its a strange world  i hope youre okay sorry to hear youre feeling like this clive its pants for sure  hopefully there will come a time when you are feeling well enough to escape its never too late  not sure about the becoming a vagrant part mainly because i wouldnt last 10 minutes but i think when we feel the need to get away anything seems better than the situation were in  i hope youre feeling better soon hi samboo and welcome to the forum  sorry to hear about the troubles youre having im wondering if you dont think its associated with your anxiety and panic attacks whether youve had tests for any physical problem  i only mention it because i suffer with asthma and i can relate to the feelings you describe of not being able to catch your breath and feeling like youre suffocating which is sometimes a lot worse than others  its just a thought hi hutton and welcome to the forum  im glad you found the strength to post here having such obsessions must make life extremely difficult at times   it gets a little quiet on the forum at this time of night but there are many members here who im sure will be able to relate to your issues  were all very supportive anyway so i hope that you continue with your story as and when you feel able to i love coffee and im quite tolerant of caffeine but it can sometimes make me feel very jittery i would imagine that its effects are more pronounced as youve been caffeine free for months ive done the same before i take someone with me and it definitely helps if its somewhere you cant familiarise yourself with first just ask somebody to show you to the room and then when youre about to leave ask that person to take you to the exit im sure theyll be helpful and will understand  im useless with directions so usually end up asking for help anyway i think its a good post and one that will be of interest to others here   there was a thread not long ago about certain physical illnesses or allergies causing symptoms that doctors thought were mental health issues for which antipsychotics were prescribed its quite frightening really it must be a horrible thing to go through but hopefully youll feel reassured once youve had your routine test in a few days  the trouble with anything that were worried about is that it makes us about 50 times more aware of it and it almost becomes obsessive   have you tried any distraction techniques for whenever you start thinking about your heartbeat as youre going to sleep have you tried listening to music the radio or a cd or reading a book so that you can concentrate fully on that i find that music mindfulness is quite helpful i hope it works for you if not it might just be a case of trying different things and finding what suits you best  this might sound silly but i sometimes use a problem of sorts  more often than not a cryptic crossword puzzle that i cant solve  and try to work it out as i go to sleep i think it works in a similar way to the music something to concentrate on and lose yourself in for a while either that or i just bore myself to sleep   anyway let us know how you get on  take care hi dee sorry to hear youre still worrying about pregnancy   youve already received some very good advice here and i think it would be well worth following i just wanted to reiterate one point and its the same advice i gave to your previous pregnancy worry its totally 100 impossible to get pregnant this way no ifs ands or buts it just can not happen  please try to stop worrying about it hi pelennor and welcome to the forum  ive not personally come across anything like this before i might be wrong but i think there was a thread a while ago that was not too dissimilar regarding lying andor denying events had occurred it might be irrelevant and not connected to your friends problems but ill see if i can find it i wouldnt hold your breath ill look tomorrow as i really need sleep at the moment  i know when i have suffered with delusions in the past that my family was told to neither completely ignore them nor to reinforce or validate them something along the lines of yes i understand that you feel that way and believe this at the moment but in my opinion this is not correct i dont know if this helps at all or if this is still seen as the best way to deal with delusions but i hope you manage to sort things with your friend  good luck that sounds awful and must be difficult to cope with i must say ive not come across anything like it before but hopefully others on here have and can offer some advice  as all of the tests youve had have come back fine have you discussed with your gp whether this could be a mental health issue or not oh my im not sure if its ocd or not i honestly couldnt say ive never come across anything like this really all i can say is that i personally have no worries about or issues with toilet paper where ever i am hey sorry to hear youre feeling worse than you were  googling isnt always a good idea theres so much conflicting evidence out there that its no wonder you feel more confused than ever   we can connect to other people male and female and feel love for them as friends without feeling anything sexual towards them i personally think that if you were gay you would have been sexually attracted to men by now which you claim you are not please try to stop worrying about it all sorry youre going through this   it sounds like the panic attacks one of my sisters gets she found cbt very helpful have you spoken to the doctor about anxiety or what to do if it is a panic attack i hope you manage to get to the bottom of it soon  by the way welcome to the forum i dont need wiki i already know its how i conceived my third child sorry to hear of your problems relationship troubles and the end of a relationship will obviously have an adverse affect and can compound further feelings of depression and anxiety my depressive episodes involve a lot of sleep  as the others have suggested i would recommend trying counselling again or any talking therapy do you feel able to go back to your gp and discuss this maybe it would be an idea to go for a med review anyway i hope you are feeling better soon  by the way welcome to the forum hi squirtle and welcome to the forum i hope youre finding it of some use  sorry to hear of your issues they sound very debilitating at times i personally think it sounds more like an anxiety issue than a personality disorder  that obviously is just my untrained view based on what you have posted others may see things differently   i hope you dont mind me asking but you mention heavy drinking is this a regular occurrence  i think discussing things further with your psychiatrist is the best way to go you explain yourself well and obviously have good insight regarding your feelings and behaviour i wish you well im so sorry to hear you are feeling so very bad that suicide seems like an option to you please think again this time of year can make things seem so much worse when youre already suffering  i think that the whole people talking suicide equals not doing it is a fallacy many of us will have hit that point i know i have on more than one occasion and its hard to think forward or to be positive about anything you are too young to have failed at life and i think you just need another chance you deserve another chance  please go to your doctor or the hospital and tell them you are feeling suicidal there is help out there please dont give up i care too if your doctor is not listening to you change doctors make an appointment to see someone else and tell them you are suicidal you dont need to talk about the rest of your worries to begin with just stress that you are suicidal and need help now there is support available and you deserve some happiness and help to feel better   a lot of what you said in your previous post sounds very similar to what my oldest son has experienced he suffered very badly with social anxiety counselling and a course of cbt helped him a great deal and taught him to learn to cope with situations in a different way that was two years ago and he hasnt self harmed since surely its worth trying again to get the help you need please try if your doctor has recommended it then yes i say go for it youve nothing to lose and possibly a lot to gain sorry to hear that your anxiety is causing such issues it must be very hard to cope with you have some very good advice above from misskitty i just wondered have you spoken to anyone about how youre feeling at the moment have you taken or are you taking any medication or seeing your doctor for your gad sorry for the questions just trying to get a better picture of how things are i would imagine that its mainly your anxiety making you feel this way do you generally get on well as in are you close to your brother i suppose how you feel about him and what your relationship is like or has been like in the past is bound to have an impact on your behaviour too  i would say hes more likely to forget about things if theyre not drawn out but again it depends on what type of person he is are you aware of clinging on to things at the time or is it just when you think about it afterwards sorry to hear of your struggles lovagemuffin paranoia is a horrible thing to go through and i know how hard it can be when there seems little hope and no light at the end of the tunnel   im glad that you have your sister to think of and i hope that you are soon feeling a lot better dee you cant get pregnant from a toilet seat end of the men are just getting a little carried away amusing but carried away   i thought your main worry was getting pregnant at all if you have sex with someone and then find out youre pregnant then thats how you got pregnant its all irrelevant dee it really is i can assure you that it is not possible to get pregnant from a toilet seat or from something you touched regardless of who has done what   please try not to worry as i said if you have sex and get pregnant then its because youve had sex and not for any other reason im not saying youre crazy at all its a very real issue for you and we all have issues the fact that i have not come across it before doesnt make it any less valid and i honestly cant believe youre the only person going through it    i think that it is worth looking in to therapy particularly as your doctor has suggested this its the same with any problem that anyone has  its about finding something that works for you you dont need to suffer as much as you are and i sincerely hope that you find something that helps sorry that youre having such a rough time with your thoughts and worries it can all seem so overwhelming and hard to think straight when your mind is bombarded with too much at once  really though youre just overthinking things everyone has worries and concerns within relationships but it sounds as though youre taking on the stresses of it all at once and prematurely just try to relax a little and be yourself rather than this person you think you should be  your girlfriend is with you because she wants to be with you and loves you for the person you are theres plenty of time to be thinking about living together and marrying when the time is right you probably wont even question those things  women dont want bad guys or supermen we want someone we can trust love and care about and receive that in return  i dont know if any of this will help but i hope you manage to relax a little and feel better about things soon hi tansjzdf and welcome to the forum  as your social anxiety has such an impact on your life i would say that getting professional help might be a good idea would you be able to go to your gp or college counsellor about your issues i would suggest gp first my oldest son suffered terribly with social anxiety when he eventually saw his doctor about it he was referred for cbt which helped him in many ways hi  im obviously not a doctor so can not tell you what you do or dont have but i seriously dont think youre going crazy you sound as though you have pretty good insight and are very aware of how youre feeling perhaps too aware i dont mean that to sound condescending or wrong i just mean that it could be that you are becoming so very anxious and worried that you do have a serious mental health problem that you are noticing many things which you may have shrugged off or not taken any notice of at all at one time sometimes reading about too many mental health issues can cloud our judgement too and we can start twisting symptoms to fit in with our experiences im not saying this is what youre doing at all merely stating that it can happen  i hate to say it but if you dont think that youre feeling this way because of your anxiety you really do need to talk to your gp in fact i think it would be wise to talk things through with your gp anyway i know you said you cant do this but maybe you need to look at it a different way and put things in to perspective for starters a gp is highly unlikely to diagnose you with schizophrenia  they would refer you for an assessment also worse case scenario if you are suffering from a serious disorder would it be better to go to your gp for some advice and a referral or hit that breaking point and end up in a psych ward you might go to your gp and find that your problems do stem from your anxiety which could then be worked on  theres no shame in mental illness and i hope that you are able to seek help and that things arent as serious as you are expecting take care hi zozo1  i havent got anything useful to add to the good responses you have received already but i just wanted to say a quick hello and welcome to the forum awww monopod no we have probably all said things we dont mean and later regret when were ill or in a bad way and its usually the people we care about the most who bear the brunt you certainly dont come across as a bad person and your post reads as caring and worried definitely not the traits of a bad one im sorry i cant offer any real advice i just felt sad reading your post and wanted to respond nothing wrong with strange quirks unless they impact detrimentally on our lives  what im trying to say i think is that if its really bothering you continues to get worse or is having a negative affect maybe talking to your gp about it would be an idea if its not bothering you too much and youre just looking for some insight or information im sure youll find it here   ive been trying to teach myself how to be a grown up for many years my children tell me not to bother anymore lol ill have to remember that  its going to be added to my top tips list  all of a sudden im feeling hungry hi   just wanted to wish you well for tomorrow i can relate to how youre feeling and how difficult it can be pepecats suggestion of headphones is a good one it might relax you as well as act as a distraction   anyway good luck hi im new here too  it seems like a good place for support and help    although i dont suffer with the same health issues i can definitely relate to the part about keeping things hidden because you dont want to worry anyone  i find it shocking that your therapist seems to brush off your feelings particularly if youve mentioned suicidal thoughts or ideations  is there anybody else you can talk to about this say your gp or a friendfamily member  i believe that thoughts like this should always be taken seriously maybe stress the seriousness of your problems again to your therapist and question her about it  i hope this helps a little  just wanted you to know that people here are thinking of you hi and thank you  its quite daunting when first trying to find your way around on here but at the same time comforting    ive read a couple of your posts about the issues with finding a good therapist and really it must be awful  they are supposed to be people who you can trust relate to and confide in  actually that should be the least you get from them  im quite lucky in that respect  i hope that both winterfall and yourself find therapists that behave as they should it must be really difficult frustrating and probably makes you feel quite alone but youre not   im obviously not qualified to give proper advice but i wonder how you would feel about writing things down and taking them in to show your therapist  you could even print or copy out what you have typed here in your posts  it might go some way to explain how youre feeling without having to actually say anything  it may not appeal to you but i have often found presenting either my previously written word  or at least typing out a list of things i want to say  more beneficial than relying on myself to say the things i want to at any given time i say its worth a try  nothing ventured nothing gained and all that  i often write down how im feeling just to get it out of my system  it doesnt work for everyone but it helps me sometimes  the night time and demons although its probably little comfort at the moment i think most can relate to that  sometimes the night time is a blessing its peaceful and quiet nobody will bother you or phone or need your attention  other times it can be the most terrifying saddest and loneliest of places to be  although new here i feel that this forum is a safe place to be  you can relay your thoughts and fears and know that someone is listening and empathizing  you are not alone\n",

      "doc: this is going to be difficult to ask or explain but i try keep an open mind and sometimes it helps to get another point of view or side to a problem and hope someone can help there are three families whos children are growing up and out on their own living nearby they are very badly behaved and anti social children and parents three of the neighbours have put their houses up for sale because of all the trouble and its like everyone is under siege from them  one of the boys who has been labelled as the ring leader is supposed to have some kind of behavioural problem but all of them are unaproachable and just shout insults and threaten people its really awful  i cant help thinking though that if the boy does have a problem it must be hard for his parents they have four more kids but does it excuse whats going on and for them and the other parents to not bother either or is it easier to just ignore and leave everyone else to get anxious and stressed people are frightened to try and stop them but want to be reasonable thanks misskitty theres no talking to the parents and i dont know them or even how long theyve been here to be honest someone said one family is known to the police   other neighbours are fed up of it all too and have tried to accept and be nice to them but its not working and im very anxious and stressed out with them not everyone can up and move out though including me  the parents just dont seem to care at all and im sorry if they cant cope or arent getting help with their problems and just wanted to try see in a way what it might be like for them but dont understand and its half term next week nightmare thanks fallen i think everyone is too scared too do anything i went out to the children one night and wasnt nasty but made some excuse going out to the car they were a bit hostile but not bad but it didnt last long though its awful being frightened in your own home yes  they have been causing damage to peoples cars and houses threatening and swearing and are frightening its boys and girls the attitude their parents have is bad too its not good at all  i dont know and cant understand how they live like they do but then think im being a snob which im not at all thanks misskitty thats the problem being careful word soon gets round and everyone knows someone it doesnt take much to point the finger even if its not you that does anything things are bad enough without all this i just hope someone else does something soon i feel sick and frightened pathetic letting kids get to me like this but at least i know am not alone its constant fear and harrasment terror im so upset with it all sorry x thanks fallen glad you think im not a snob and decent i wonder sometimes and try tell myself not to be such a grumpy old cow x theyre out its been quiet all day until now im shaking again thanks topcat i dont think there is anywhere like that here and everyones frightened of contacting the pcsos but think and hope someone will complain soon i keep having to stop myself from going out and shouting at them which would be the worst thing to do and think is what they want really think im going to go put the tv on now so cant hear them hope youre feeling better take care x hi alesha im sorry not have any advice but hope you can find someone to help and be ok x hi liz and  im sorry youre struggling and can relate to what youre saying  mine isnt so much agoraphobia but social phobia but i understand the not feeling happy and relaxed at home too it can and does get better with the right help and support  is there a different gp you could try see or speak with waiting times for therapy can be quite long but it wouldnt hurt to ask about it again  i hope you dont feel so alone being here there are lots of us who understand take care clouds x hi deimos im sorry youre anxious and feel alone have you tried contacting mind or the cab to see if they can advise or help your gp might be able to help too if you can speak to them try get a telephone appointment first if they do them and ring samaritans if you need to over the weekend they can only listen but sometimes it just helps hearing and speaking to someone  please take care and keep posting if it helps x hey tina youve had and are still having to try manage with so many things its not surprising your body is reacting to all the stress and anxiety as well x  i lost over two stone had awful stomach upsets and sickness couldnt eat the annoying thing is worrying about having stomach upsets on top of everything else but it can and will get better  xxx hi bearandmoon i dont know if this will help but i often wake up with a churning stomach and feeling anxious about the day ahead and have found it helps to get straight out of bed and go make a cup of tea or coffee then it kinds of stops me from laying in bed and worrying more the lighter morning are making doing it easier and dont know if you work or have other commitments or can rest in the day but it might be worth a try x hi gajolene of course i remember you and have wondered how you were doing sorry youre not so good but am here if you want to chat xx i dont know if this is agoraphobia social anxiety or both but can walk and go out into the countryside or quiet places and be ok or fine even but cant walk down the street or in town and busier places hardly ever and its got worse over the past few months noise makes me panic a lot too  is agoraphobia really more a fear of whats on the outside rather than a fear of the outside itself   thanks  clouds x hi lucretia and thankyou for being lovely x its not nice thinking everyone is watching and laughing or judging and am sure theyre not but understand feeling like it sometimes x hi mk thankyou youre right about alerting system the hyper vigilance had lessened a lot but is back now even in the house dont think i could wear ear phones because of having to listen for danger all the time and  the effects of too much stress and need for peace and simplicity makes sense too x hope youre both ok and have a relaxing weekend  xx hi cloudberry a caravan sounds like a great idea and im glad its helped do you have any idea why travelling west is more difficult  my friend offered to let me use their small motorhome but trying to get insurance was nearly impossible and way too expensive when we did find somewhere maybe one to think about for the future though  hope you can get out and about to some nice places while the weathers good hi rubybegonia  to the forum i think im right in saying the mental health forum originated in the uk and although many members are based there people join and participate in the discussions from all over the world or stumble accross the forum whilst browsing looking for information and advice caravans are known as trailers in the usa not sure if motorhomes are called the same as well as gad and social anxiety i have a number of issues going on diagnosis including clinical depression but dont think now agoraphobia is one of them  its only possible for me to go in coffee or other shops away from where i live with the exception of braving the supermarket and one other shop very occasionally  we the gp psych support worker do know the underlying cause and reasons for these fears and illness two years of therapy helped and medication since late last year still sorting out  thankyou for your kindness tips and advice i do appreciate it and hope you are keeping well its nice to meet you clouds x hi sophie92 sorry i dont have any wise words but can relate in a way to how youre feeling up until a few years ago any kind of public transport wasnt a problem at all now i cant go anywhere without the car on my own i think somersetscorpio is right in that if you can identify and know what the root cause of your anxiety is it would be a start in working on it and not letting it hold you back either from getting on  is there anyone that could go with you on short journeys at quiet times by train or bus with to rebuild your confidence or can you look into seeing a different therapist maybe who can give other advice to the one before as it was a while ago i have travelled by bus but not on my own building up slowly hope you can overcome whatevers going on and follow your ambitions for an exciting career and future take care and good luck x im sorry your friend did that nickelle it does seem to happen quite often unfortunately and is very hurtful sometimes people dont realise just how much  do you have any hobbies or interests that might be a way of meeting new people and anyone that could go along with you at first x hi chansu  to the forum i have sa too have you spoken to mind at all  they might be good to ring first if youre nervous about speaking to or seeing a doctor and are usually very helpful  hi to you too blueglass im glad the forum is helping and making you feel more confident hopefully we can help you too chansu xx hi lostgirl19 im sorry youre struggling with this and can empathise it can and will get better  have you thought about getting an advocate to try help  they would probably come see you at home first and chat about what youre finding difficult and try alleviate some of the worries support you with going to appointments or seeking further help  its just an idea and sorry if youve tried already please take care and keep posting if it helps clouds x youre very welcome i know its hard but try not to be embarrassed when the gp first referred me to cmht i didnt know what was going on how they could help and was very anxious it didnt help that id worked with mh teams before in my job even though it was a long time ago  sometimes its easier to speak to someone impartial not family or friends mind might be able to give you some advice too try be brave and phone them you shouldnt have to give your name or any details at first if you dont want to and can always put the phone down and call them back if its too much at first xx thats ok and am glad to help if i can anytime lots of services have been withdrawn but they might still be able to help and give advice please dont feel alone or anything with it all x hi lucretia you can skype without a webcam if you want to its just like being on the telephone and its free im sure you have beautiful eyes that sparkle xx hi kate27 its good youre going to see your doctor tomorrow try not feel anxious write everything down you want to say and ask about if it will help in like a list of short points and reminders  if youve had a shock or traumatic experience of any kind there are people and ways to help you deal with whatevers happened therapy and possibly meds like has been mentioned already  i hope being here helps too and you start feeling better soon take care  clouds x hi justchecking i dont have ocd but the best way ive found is too try keep calm concentrate and lock a door turn a tap or plugs off whatever it is and say out loud locked done off i have to do it with the cooker boiler windows etc and even if have to check and say it again it seems to work sorry if thats no help or youve tried it already x hi dan and welcome to the forum  im so sorry about your mum youve been through an awful lot and it sounds like atm your self confidence is low and sleeping patterns mixed up  could you try going to sleep and getting up ten or fifteen minutes earlier say do it gradually and discuss your medication and possible referral for therapy with your gp or pdoc sometimes it takes ages to find one that suits better i tried lots dont worry about talking to yourself unless you really feel its affecting or worrying you like shaky says your most definitely not alone with doing that  its great that youre wanting and trying to do things and  looking toward the future positively dont give up and hope youll find being here and talking helps take care clouds x hi auntvickie im sorry not to have any advice but just wanted to welcome you to the forum  x hi worried93 and welcome to the forum i know this temp job might not be ideal and  am sorry youre feeling anxious and scared but my friend and daughter both went on to get full time jobs after temping it helped a lot with their cvs and getting the experience so might be worth giving it a go if you can one of them got a permanent job where they were temping  is there anything you can take or do to help distract and keep busy with that might help you sleep too im sure the employers wouldnt expect anyone to go in and be able to do everything straight away and cant tell you what to decide but hope it goes well whatever you do good luck clouds x i dont think youre whining or boring either fallen its hard really hard sometimes true and genuine friends dont make you feel like sht or abandon you when those who you thought were always going to be there leave and arent after almost a lifetime it hurts and leaves lots of questions but do you know what theyre not worth the worry or time if thats how it is  peoples lives change they go on to do different things or not but anyone who intentionally hurts anyone or anything whatever the circumstances is best left to it that sounds unkind and probably wrong but you dont need or deserve to be hurt anymore xx hi bert i dont feel exactly like it but maybe in a way bed and inside home with the curtains shut is like a safe place but going to ground hiding  when i can get to somewhere out in the open that is safe i love to look up at the sky and everything around its like a big window opening and being able to breathe or move without feeling afraid they might be little adventures but can be so good hope youre ok xx hi lx sorry your anxiety has been worse over the weekend finals exams and the run up to them can be a very anxious time  the only thing i can say is some of the advice i remember being given to students here and you probably know already try eat and drink well take some extra vitamins if needed and organise study into bite size chunks with breaks in between something relaxing away from the books if you can getting some fresh air even opening a window or standing outside on the porch or garden hi shades and welcome to the forum what you are saying and describing does sound very familiar and am sure does to a lot of people here too but try not to worry its good you have friends that can go out with you do you have any support or help from your gp or a support worker too  mind or the cab would probably be able to advise and help you if you havent spoken to them already i hope youve managed to get more sleep and someone else here might be able to give better advice when they can there are lots of sub forums here including ones for ptsd and gad and lots more hope youll have a look and post some more take care clouds dont worry about not going so long as you feel safe and have something to eat and drink when you can its so awful being panicked by the thought of going out into public sometimes but is and will be do able again  i hope the doctor will have some ideas and be able to help you on monday thinking of you x thankyou for all the hugs and replies i dont know what was going on and got in a panic had a restless night but have been asleep today xx this sounds very silly but i feel frightened someone has just been knocking on the door my dog keeps growling i darent go out even with my rifle no one knocks on the door at this time of night hi fallen thankyou i dont know my dog is still growling if its a neighbour or friend they would shout through the letterbox to me looks like its going to be a very restless night armed and ready if needed x thanks fallen and youre right with my dog picking up on anxiety they all do i think more then we realise sometimes and for warnings geese are good too  i think whoever it was has gone away now but dogs have been stolen here and in the surrounding area recently its very worrying and am on guard more then ever x hi sorry mk but i replied to another thread before reading your reply to this one and said some things a bit the same in it an interesting article cpu but i darent say anymore hi oobiemoobie thanks yes winning the lottery would be a pretty good shock i sometimes think that if someone one day said pack an overnight bag were going somewhere and then we went to some new place that i never would have thought and stayed did and saw different things that were so beautiful and good it would make me feel better and be so good it took away all the bad  sorry im going into one of my dos againlol hi mk i suppose what im thinking is if something can change someones life in such a bad way why cant something change someones life back in the other direction  im thinking of selling the house and just taking off into the unknown but towards and where i might find some answers and chance of escaping this even though i love my remaining family more than anything  hope youre ok and do get a surprise valentine trip or present x hi unwell thankyou i dont know if it does or not  there is a man in australia who rescues orphaned kangaroos near the town city of alice springs he seems so devoted and love his life and what he does so much without modern convenience or a wife and children thats very special and two ladies in the town who rescue them too  ive left it too late and will never see or experience any of these things unless im very brave very soon and do something hope youre ok today hi dita85 im glad you saw it too and thankyou x is someone who cant stop grieving really mentally ill or is it the loss is too much and genuinely leaves them broken hearted sorry but i cant stop thinking about this now and dont what anyone can say more hi cazzh im sorry and dont know if its anxiety but its good that the doctors done blood tests some of what youre describing does sound anxiety and season related or both this is just from personal experience though and in no way a diagnosis at all did you tell the doctor youre taking st johns wort it is a powerful natural remedy that doesnt always suit everyone or mix well with other medications its hard to say anymore but hope youve got some support around you and someone here can help more soon take care and people do understand lots of things and feelings x what happens if grief and ptsd turns into anxiety and depression as well everyone has different ways of grieving but there is supposed to be stages of grief and sometimes they only get so far and cant move beyond a certain stage  there is a television programme next week about a young soldier who was traumatised  so much by what he saw and experienced he couldnt go on its very sad he had some counselling from the army but his mum doesnt think it was enough  im going to try watch it not sure sometimes i think the world has become too complicated basic and fundamental but good and meaningful most important even if simple things are lost and forgotten  maybe the world has to rewind in more ways then it realises to be civilised and survive i know you hate going to doctorsim the same but well done for making the appointment they will hopefuly be able to do tests and put your mind at rest  i had and still do get similar symptoms to the ones youve described and was worried sick had ecg xray and blood tests and they came back clear hope very much its the same for you i didnt believe that anxiety etc could cause such physical symptoms but think they must do sometimes now not saying its the same for you but understand how worrying and scary it can be its best to get checked out though sorry thats not much help but hope you feel better soon x hi meercat i dont like pills either but sometimes they can be good and im glad youre feeling settled and calm in a nice bubble  sorry not to have replied to your other threads but have been thinking about you just didnt know what to say were ok here thankyou and feeling pretty calm too tonight x try not to worry topcat youre doing your best and very well with everything mks right and i cant really help as much but hope you can have a relaxing evening take care clouds x wish i had the guts to do it last year here a dog ran out of the park on to the motorway and was runover when fireworks were going off it was midmorning on a school day too and another woman with her dog fell and broke her hip trying to get away from kids throwing them about theyre a menace a couple have just gone off and im starting to shake already because theyll get worse it must be kids messing about but they make me really anxious and my dogs not too keen either why do they do it theres nothing wrong with enjoying a quiet academic side of life and keeping an open mind and is something that a lot of people dont understand and are probably missing out on lots even if not academic sometimes being quiet and still and opening the mind to new ideas and experiences gets lost i worked in an office full of women that thought i was a nerd but i thought they were lol x hi misskitty this might sound silly but one of the things ive found to help is smells good smells an aroma or scent perfume that reminds me of nice things from better times  it might be a bit like the old fashioned smelling salts but in a nicer way some aromatherapy oils or a solid perfume with them in to keep with me help kind of therapy is also helping as an alternative to meds most of the time theyre not right for everyone am not sure about herbal tablets youd need to check up on them and with some oils as well i think hope you can find something to help soon youre welcome i babble too mostly to myself or my dog or a piece of tree in the corner hi big g that must have been scary and very painful and hope youre feeling a bit better now  sounds like youre having to cope with a lot and are doing really well they were a good ambulance service to check you out so well and hope things get better for you soon  sorry im new but just wanted to say hi and hope you have a better night hey bigg dogs are the best arent they i wouldnt leave the house if i didnt have one your boy sounds lovely and good company its good you can both get out and enjoy the top of the hill together  hope youre doing ok hes lovely and youre daughter is too for looking after you im sorry youre in so much pain and not getting much sleep feel better soon and go for a slap up meal with your daughter  im ok thankyou but its one of those nights when dont know what to say very much but want to say loads but dont know why or who to am a bit tired and dont like sport on tv hi big g how you doing i hope the new anti depressants will help you feel better its awful when non of them work or have horrible side effects  today im angry brooding and have spoken to only my dog and piece of tree and shouted at the notice that keeps popping up on the tv to re tune it for all the olympic coverage and press the yellow button to get rid of it guess which one i did  its bonkers hi wendolene26 hope you are ok now sorry i dont know how to stop panic attacks all the time but started to in the shop today and of all things focused on a packet of chewing gum at the checkout stand  i didnt want to reply before because it sounds silly but it did work clouds hi when will it end i think anxiety and stress can have an effect on physical well being too like jippy tummy from being nervous or head aches and things  if im in a real state the chest pains start and bad headaches stomach churns the list goes on but distraction and trying to be calm deep breathing when it happens stops some of it  one thing i have found is that once the doctors know you have mental health problems and you go with physical stuff they blame it on the stress a lot of times but should get things checked out to be sure\n",

out my beloved 15 yr old dog has bone cancer i am so scared im gonna break down in therapy tomorrow picked chicken meat have 3 cups now made cookies and put away sausage that my husband cooked up the cookies are soon good trying to get back into discussion with class but cant think of anything i need to do that before sunday mostly reading and wanting to go to sleep but i cant anxiety at 11 am but i was cooking so i hunkered down and did stuff other than that ive been snacking and reading making dinner here soon havent done the check ins in a while so making the rounds checked in in depression but anxiety is bothering me more at the moment so here i am bad intrusive thoughts today dont know what to make of them i really hate that ive been getting them lately they make me feel like a monster i feel wired my hands are shakey my head is hurting why does anxiety have to manifest physically too i just want to relax but i never can i wish my fiance understood that i wish i were at home right now i would take an ativan and have my ben and jerrys chocolate fudge ice cream anxiety arrived around noon so i stuffed my face for lunch not good discussed some more on my poetry class forum hopefully that will be enough for a good score just couldnt get into it i seem to disagree with a lot of the other students other than that a lazy day need to do some laundry tomorrow im full of anxiety about my money and my life neither of which belong to me evidently anxiety due to my friend visiting me today he has been in a bad mood lately and visiting me seems to make it worse i wish i had gotten up in time for the first smoke break over two hours until the next one my two little birds my niece and daughter had a cold war going on earlier and it jacked up my anxiety i dislike conflict theyve already resolved it and im still trying to lower my anxiety i think ill make a batch of pina coladas and head for the beach to chill hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those who are struggling spent most of the day with a migraine and upset stomach seems to have settled down now couldnt take my meds this morning so im just coasting until bedtime woke up earlier with a sense of anxiety went back to sleep woke up again and i had an impending sense of doom and dread went back to sleep woke up again and im having a flat out panic attack i dislike anxiety intensely hope everybody is ok and hugs to those that are struggling woke up early this morning with quite a bit of anxiety wonder if i knew my client was going to call me and leave another vague message now im just going to be anxious all day wondering what he wanted i got triggered in another forum so im going to take a few days away from pc i hope everyone is ok and offer hugs to those that are struggling my therapist gave me his cell and offered me to call him today just to talk because i am struggling with my dog bone cancer diagnosis and well i hate calling people i get such anxiety about it and always worry i am bothering people so i was unsure about it and debated it for hours but i finally did it and called we talked around 10 minutes it went well small steps i have social anxiety and used to struggle to initiate conversations or even continue conversations others started with me as most of you can relate i wanted to be more normal so i started focusing on my problem areas one of the issues i had was struggling to make eye contact  i forced myself to start making eye contact with strangers and retail workers when i was out and about at first it was difficult and i shied away from it but over time i got better now i have a problem eye contact doesnt bother me anymore but that means i end up making too much eye contact  i dont deliberately stare people down or anything but i have noticed during interviews the interviewer seems to always get uncomfortable towards the end of the interview its much worse with women than with men women tend to get creepy vibes from my focused looks the problem boils down to i dont know how to fix myself so that i dont stare or come off as weird for looking into peoples eyes too much i never aimed to make people uncomfortable but that is exactly what ive done does anyone have any suggestions for making proper eye contact that doesnt come off as creepy or forced if youre talking to someone i find it easier to look away if i nod at something they say or i make a certain to gesture to something i found this link to the secrets to making nonawkward eye contact which helped somewhat i took yalls advice and also softened my gaze i would go into my head when the interviewer was talking instead of focusing on the fact that i was staring someone in the eyes and that seemed to help getting anxious tomorrow is the first therapy session i will have where i am not bringing one of my dogs it is gonna be too hot for a dog to go out and somehow that feeling of extra vulnerable without him there scares the  outta me i almost feel like i need to cancel not sure i can do a session like this i trust my therapist and feel safe with him but just not used to not having a dog around me its how in general i am able to talk to people easier doing okay i will see my counselor in the morning my doc prescribed a medicine that was once used for other things but now is used to treat anxiety and its non habit forming which was something i liked i started on it tonight and already i see a huge difference wow have i been carrying that emotional weight on my shoulders this whole time it feels like you only know how heavy something is when it is lifted for awhile i awoke disappointed that i did then the dread  and worry  and anxiety just got my midterm for my poetry class 700 word essay due on sunday i have the outline written out now to fill it all out along with my other homework arrrgh otherwise im doing alright went to t this morning and that was okay still having restlessness but i think ill get through it doctors appt went well she wants to see me in three months hopefully i can keep my blood sugar from dropping in the morning i finished my homework for my orientation class now trying to think up a poem for my poetry class been hurting all day knee stopped hurting may be bursitis according to my doc but upper back and shoulders have been kicking finishing up on dinner smells good had some anxiety today but i plowed through it hi everyone before i get started i want to tell you a bit about my past i was diagnosed with social anxiety 10 years ago and would say the time when i was 1415 years old was the time where my anxiety was the absolute worst i couldnt go to school anymore because i was afraid to talk in class felt like people where staring and laughing going to the supermarket was nearly impossible life was a nightmare things slowly started to get better when i turned 18 and i even started a small job at a factory who hires people with mental disorders almost 2 years ago but in the past 68 months things have been going downhill again my best friend ditched me without warning coworkers who used to talk to me stopped doing so some of them now happily greet my husband but ignore me completely while im right there he cant explain why either which is driving me crazy there are also two coworkers who stare at me all the time i hate it i always feel like people are staring at me and giving me judgemental looks i know im far from pretty and look a bit weird but i also feel like i might be behaving weird i just want to be invisible something is wrong with me and i feel like everyone knows it everyone sees it and they all hate and judge me for it and thats why ive often been a victim to bullies teachers even strangers there is a mother with 3 kids 46 years i think who takes the same bus as i do to get to work and even her two sons have pointed and laughed at me before they dont speak german or english so i once again dont even know what was so wrong and funny about me its always like this did i act weird said something stupid made a mistake going out is getting more and more difficult i already cancelled going to the movies with my friend twice and started hating my job my workplace will be somewhere else soon so we will share the building with other workgroups now and i will have to use a different train to get to work which is already stressing me out there was a man on the train today who was staring nonstop for like 3 stops i looked back at him because for a moment i got so angry but when he didnt stop i quickly looked away again because i was afraid he would start yelling or something my husband has anxiety related anger issues which can be problematic when we go out hell start complaining about other people on the bus get angry if someone just looks at him in a weird way or even bump into others if he feels like they are blocking the way i cant talk to him about this hes suffering from his own demons and he would feel betrayed its the last thing i want i feel ugly weak dumb like a coward or a failure and everyone seems to know it i want to be invisible i want to stay at home and not see anyone beside my family and husband anymore even posting this here on a public forum is stressing me out but i dont know what to do sorry this text got so long hi thanisson you are beautiful strong smart brave and successful people that look at you are more likely thinking about themselves and dont know you or have any idea of the person inside of you try to imagine their stares are passing right through you and falling like dust on the floor i hope things get better for you hi thanisson just wanted to say i absolutely relate to your experiences and i wish i could just be invisible as well i have pretty bad social anxiety meds have taken away some of the intensity which has reduced the frequency of panic attacks but the overall thought patterns are still present its difficult when im around people i go for walks every day as a test and as a kind of exposure therapy i constantly practise letting go and try to bring myself to an inner place of centeredness i try not to let the anxious paranoid thoughts take hold which is obviously easier said than done but it helps to a degree and lately ive been trying to be a bit friendlier saying hello sometimes if i catch someone looking at me etc thats helping me as well a little bit keep pluggin away and hang in there thanisson i believe its all about growth i feel the same when im out as if everybody is laughing at me you are not a coward or a failure in fact you are brave and strong for facing this went to neurosurgeon this afternoon my back looks fine in that sense so i have another referral for pain management insurance wont cover acupuncture so cant do that also made another appointment with dermatology my forehead is still flaking and there is a rash other than that just reading and cleaning up the kitchen making pot roast and it smells good i went on a jet ski tour with my daughter and niece where you encounter and swim with dolphins in the wild and then walk around an island picking up sand dollars i had a big panic attack before we went that i hid from the girls the water was really rough at 515 and i was anxious most of the time i did enjoy swimming with the dolphins finally it was over they want to go again tomorrow hope everyone is doing ok and giving out hugs to those that are struggling this has been a strange day i read and slept through most of it anxiety hit around 1130 am so i laid down and didnt get up until 3 pm i checked the elearning sites for my classes and didnt find anything new kind of sad but i hope it doesnt turn into depression just wishing i couldve done more today but i just wasnt feeling good still have to take a shower and make dinner really tired now though if i were better looking i would have less anxiety i used to be pretty but aging has wreaked havoc on my body i was always vain about my looks and now i know i have nothing left to be vain about i have more anxiety due to knowing how bad i look going home tomorrow after two weeks in florida no anxiety yet thats a good sign had a really good time i want to go home hope everyone is doing ok and giving hugs to all that are struggling tomorrow i have someone coming to hopefully fix a problem with my tv little anxious about this i dont do well at all with people in my personal space and to be quite honest i keep having this thought hell take my tv i know he wont i think all he needs to do is enter some code thing but hmm hopefully i am not going to freak out in front of a professional well i dont know if i have social anxiety perhaps i do i take our dog out for long walks in the neighborhood every day but ive always hated crowds years ago when i would be out in public for example at a shopping mall id become increasingly uncomfortable sometimes to the point where i would begin to feel dizzy  disoriented if i remained in the situation long enough i always just kept what was going on with me to myself  toughed it out and id have to say this has gotten better as ive gotten older however i still avoid any kind of crowd like the plague and i prettymuch just keep to myself in general i seldom go anywhere unless its necessary ive also always been extremely glossophobic thankfully i no longer have occasion to do any public speaking but in general id have to say that at this point in my life i dont not go out due to anxiety i just really have no use for people in general in real life  i prefer to keep my own company i got diagnosed with social anxiety at 17 and i kinda came about when i came out of high school and was having anxiety attacks that were debiltating that made not want to go to english class upgrading after i graduated from high school it brought up all these nightmares i had that because i was bullied from grade 4 to grade 12 by teachers and students alike my mom always forced me into things and i am introvert through and through to be honest it was like a nightmare i always wanted to go home with her but after awhile after i got used to it but i felt like i was put into a difficult spot it was uncomfortable i remember at 18 being kicked out of my own house she said that i needed to get a job and be a productive part of society yet how could i  i was trapped in my own social anxiety scared stiff so i found a job in alberta and off onto a plane i went with her to fort mcmurray i was scared stiff then the job fell through so i then called someone in jasper after i was working for a short while i doubled over and couldnt work due to debilating period cramps i was taken back to staff accomadation i had some food and took mefanic acid which i had been taking since i was 12but 11 was when i firstly got my period anywaythey fired me on the spot after they asked what i was taking and i showed them the bottle being naive and just really honest i been honest since day one a cab driver convinced me to stayi got a job as a dishwasher and stayed 2 12 years lateryet my mom became very manipulative towards me she demanded that i pay divit ends towards her for all the money that i owed her for feeding me and clothing me through all my years from 017 i was shocked how could this person i know and love turn against me of course my social anxiety went through the roof i started to have panic attacks at work and would lock myself into stalls and not come out unless the radio that i wore went off my work suffered yet they wouldnt fire me i their only housewoman i did double shifts some nightsdays i didnt know what was night and what was day anymore during the winter monthsmy mother wanted me to come home for christmases but thats the most busiest time of the year and how would i leave some place i called home for her home a woman who wanted me to bring her expensive gifts when i stopped at her house or saw her there it was disasterous because i used alcohol at the age of 13 when my dad introduced me to it so i brought her home some truffles in a jar that were white in wine they were expensive and the first thing out of her mouth was how dare you bring me home crap in a bottle i looked at her and thought how could i believe this woman to be my mother i locked myself in the bathroom at my parents house and wouldnt come out i cried and cried attack after attack happened i went on a national youth volunteer program here called katimavik for 9 months  21 i pushed myself to do it my mother would call me everyday asking me what i got up to finally she was interested in what i was doing my anxiety flared up every time she called it didnt help we were 11 strangers living in house together and she wanted to know what i was upt to and when i said nothing she was like where is my cuti told her to never to call me again unless it was urgent then the next day she would call mei just stopped answering the phone she didnt understand long distance was expensive on cellphone especially since i was roaming out of alberta with an alberta area code i made up paper bills and asked her for money to cover the costs of the calls eventually she stopped calling anyways long story short i was comfortable with my group but each place we landed which was a different province every 3 months i had anixety and would make myself puke before an interview because it was so bad to this day i puke every time i go for an interview its like horrible i struggle to get out of the house i also have a huge issues around people and food because they make us food thats like cross contamination i get anxiety going to restuarants but i always ask some times if i never been there before if i could get a chefs sample plate because the anxiety is so bad to order something they dont have that i know someone cannot fck up i also cant read peoples body lanugage too well so its disturbing to me that someone can go from being mad to completely nutso towards someone anyways sorry i droned on i hoped this helped with some peoples fears 1 of the issues i have is that if theirs a lot of people say in a room that actually far away from where i am it sounds like they are actually just outside and i cant even step outside my room to do something even though i know deep down that the next 34 rooms are clear i dont want to be spotted so i used to hate it when my parents had people round to dinner i couldnt go to toilet i couldnt get a drink i couldnt open a window i couldnt do anything my story is simple i avoid mingling with people whenever possible when i cannot i make fool of myself because i would be obviously anxious and nervous which is painful and shatters my selfesteem big time anxiety is a fundamental part of my flawed character since my childhood what works for me ive figured is to be left alone nothing else thats why i am alone most of the time and probably i will die alone which is ok by me i have come to accept this i am so anxious today because i think i need to talk to my boyfriend about moving out ive had this apartment for almost 2 years and he moved in shortly after i did everything was good for a while but now were having financial problems and can barely afford to stay here especially with rent going up again next month im at a point where i feel like i have to decide between things that i shouldnt have to decide between like buying a quick snack or going hungry all day or getting my medication or restocking the kitchen i think we need to move back home separately because thats the only way we can save any money hes not going to like it i dont even like it but i cant keep going like this anymore anxiety is a lot better this afternoon my boyfriend took the plan to move our really well thankfully i was a little worried hed want to go with the lets wait and see plan again going to my parents house later to talk to them about moving back in im sure they wont say no just have to start figuring out the time line of moving and what were doing with everything im starting to ease myself into the day woke up late again but oh well new day new start my apartment is clean bonus i have food in the fridge to eat bonus my craft projects are lined up to complete bonus i just feel like lazing about right now its sundaythe weekend except tomorrow i want to get my day started earlier pretend its a real workday since im on a leave of absence from my job for the next few months i would like to keep some sort of schedule going despite being sick my anxiety today was not as bad as yesterday which was really quite bad and scaring mebut i was stuck at home today with sick child so maybe knowing i would be home all day settled it down not sure ive never been diagnosed with social anxiety but im sure i have it i can relate to a lot of the experiences in this thread im an introvert who has never really been able to form a lot of friendships even on pc in school i was severely bullied it was during this time i became very aware that i was different to minimize the teasing i withdrew and kept to myself this seemed to have caused me to become awkward and anxious during any social interaction outside of my family i would panic when i had nothing to add to a conversation usually i just ended up being the quiet one no one wanted to befriend me because of that they all claimed i was boring my reserved nature seems to bother people especially the extroverted variety i often relive social situations and criticize myself for things i have said and done sometimes i cant sleep it has gotten to the point where i dont volunteer any information and keep all social interaction to a minimum now i mostly keep to myself i like being alone a lot it is comforting this is eroding my selfesteem even though i enjoy being alone i want a few close friends that i can share life with i even worry about my posts nobody seems to reply to them so i dont post what is really bothering me except for now anxiety is high today i am starting to feel attached to my therapist and terrified beyond words to tell him i cant do it i just cant risk him terminating me or cutting me off from emails etc i need him to stay as is so i dont regret trusting him hoping this will go away soon maybe i should go run some laps or something to clear my mind a bit so we got back from florida yesterday after an 8 hour drive i had a panic attack during the trip while i was driving and had to have everyone distract me we got back and there was word waiting on us that my daughter received 4 scholarships that will cover everything down to her books and room and board the college is 2 hours away and i have mixed feelings about that had bad dreams about it last night and awoke with a pounding heart i know i have to let her fly telling myself that doesnt help my anxiety level though it helps to post it here hope everyone is doing ok and hugs to those that are struggling i went to my hair salon this morning i wanted a new look to lift my spirits i think getting your hair cut and dyed can be very stressful for some people it was for me anyway three hours later and the whole time i was clenching my fists my hair has gone from long midback to shoulder length with ombre color surprisinglyi love it i almost cried tears of joy i really needed this change my natural light brown hair doesnt look so ratty anymore thanks for reminding mei needed to set up a hair appt next month been another slow day been in pain and sore and sweating so other than four loads of laundry i didnt do much will make dinner here shortly anxiety came in around 11 am so laid down for a while ive had social anxiety for as long as i can remember when i was a child i couldnt speak at all in school i was very chatty with my parents but i was completely mute at school my teachers didnt even realize i could talk at first my therapist now says i would have been diagnosed with selective mutism if i saw a psychiatrist at that time starting around age 5 i would have panic attacks at school that were so severe i would pass out throughout my childhood i saw so many doctors and cardiologyneurology specialists trying to determine the source of my episodes now known to be panic attacks so my social anxiety was compounded by hypochondria and the constant fear that my heart was going to explode i also felt like a weird sick kid with all my doctors appointments and would get so embarrassed when i was dizzy or passed out in front of the other kids i would be afraid of having an episode which would make an episode more likely to happen im sure people with panic attacks are familiar with this feedback loop i continued to not have treatment for my social anxiety and was so afraid of speaking i had very few friends and always received poor class participation marks school was always a major social anxiety trigger as i hated being around so many other people my mom thought she was helping my shyness by forcing me into so many extracurricular activities soccer tennis theater piano church groups community service clubs when i was older working at jobs that had high social interaction requirements and i remember my childhood just a big ball of anxiety i picked up some maladaptive coping behaviors to deal with the anxiety i was a huge daydreamer  while the other kids talked to eachother i would sit alone and escape into fantasy worlds in my brain i also started self injurying around 7 years old when i was in my late teens i developed an eating disorder as ive gotten older i am now well into adulthood im more in charge of my lifestyle and dont have to force myself into social situations i dont have many friends and i long for more social contact but its difficult i tend to cycle through phases so some times i am better than other times the idea of going to a social gathering makes me feel sick when i get very overwhelmed sometimes i literally get sick and have to throw up i think being an adult i feel more functional because im less anxious more of the time  but really ive just managed my schedule in a way that im incredibly avoidant of any kind of social trigger im a graduate student now and mostly work independently on my research which is nice my major triggers now are when i have to give presentations at meetings or for my committee i have this issue as welli tryed the breathing techniquesbut it isnt working very well for me anxiety has taken over my life i am 38 and have zero friends no spouse no children nothing not exactly where i saw my self being this anxiety stems from many many many years of abuse from father to boyfriend verbal emotional and physical i dont like anything about myself and i feel that others dont as well i even tend to only see family when i have to i dont like talking on phone i would rather text it seems like i can get out what i want to say better by writing than by talking my mind moves way faster than my mouth but i can type fast and seem to keep up the strange part of my life is this i work as a pit boss in a casino and i have to be around and talk to people for 8 hours or more and i have no problem whats so ever i enjoy my job very much and i think its because these people dont know me they dont know what ive been through they dont know how i feel about myself when i look in a mirror its like i am a completely different person at work i am confident and outgoing i smile and laugh unless it is slow when it gets slow my thoughts creep back in and i get really quiet i am at a point where i think i need to talk to someone but i dont know where to start i currently have a psychiatrist who only fills me with meds they even diagnosed me with bipolar i or bipolar depression but i dont feel that is whats going on am i depressed yes 100 my life sucks i have also had a very rough life that i dont know how to let go of and move on i have had no guidance just me winging it that is not obviously working from the time i was little i was bullied at school i have a very abusive father and followed suit in boyfriends i feel i dont know how to be happy or what it is supposed to feel like i have so much built up anger and maybe i need some anger management on top of therapy so if you are a person that knows me personally i probably will not attend anything i am invited to unless it is a life changing event i really dont want to be that person any more i want my life back please help i have social anxiety because of the trauma ive suffered at others hands severe bullying severe physical abuse and emotional abuse im very shy a loner and an introvert i too hate crowds and am ill at ease around folks other then my family and close friends im just not willing to open up and get hurt again i am in therapy so maybe someday well yea its anxiety and i just have it its like fear of stuff or just feeling annoyed idk being in college in computer science where people are just so loud annoys me dont know if related my social anxiety can get so bad that i put off work activities and jeopardize my job because of it ive just recently admitted to myself that i suffer from social anxietywell actually i had admitted it to myself i just didnt want to mention it to anyone else the crazy thing is that i actually like being around people i draw energy from being around other people i just suffer such anxiety from having to interact and being afraid of rejection and criticism and judgment that i will avoid social situations at all costs i have recently admitted to myself that my maladaptive avoidance coping behaviors have been causing a lot of harm to my life im trying to work on changing them so i can finally start having the life i want seesaw i have social anxiety mainly because i always feel embarrassed when im out in public this is because my parents are very overprotective of me so they make me wear a lot of heavy winter clothing im always the most bundled up person so it makes me stand out so much especially at school so i just get nervous and start sweating then i swear even more because i get hot wearing so many layers my anxiety got kicked into higher gear today because i had a visitor from the assisted living place she said its no vaping because its a fire hazard what it doesnt burn anything it vaporizes ejuice so ok not for me but the conservator will not like that  me saying i wont go there she will find someplace even worse to force me to go to im really getting high anxiety just thinking about ither no anxiety has shown up today at this time more down then anything else the weather has been dreary since i got back and its really influencing my moods im really down hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling i spent most of the day writing my midterm essay and almost of my homework for the week i still have a little bit left but part of one is waiting for my teammates to post im beat ill look over my essay tomorrow before i turn that in took a shower put dishes away and made a quick dinner my husband is also doing a lot of homework and hes as tired as i am i didnt take the latuda so i didnt have a big anxiety attack today otherwise i did okay if the going down to 20mg doesnt work my new pdoc will try something else i hope not because this will be the fourth time trying a new mood stabilizer and except for the akathisia it works great i live with a narcissistic histrionic manipulative person and im proud of myself for getting along with them 99 of the time today was not one of those times i totally blew up and said some things i probably should not have said im still very very angry and trying to calm down it helps me to get it out thanks for letting me vent im going to orientation with m in midjuly for 2 days the parents  students sleep in the dorms every interaction weve had with this school has been top notch im less anxious and more excited about this now shell get a quality education with no student loan debt i feel like weve been blessed today is sunny so i get to float in the pool i also feel like cleaning the house a little good day so far hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling did a lot of reading today laid down for a couple of hours but still no sleep i slept off and on most of the night its been raining buckets and now the plaster in the living room is peeling no word from the roofers yet last thing we heard was midjuly anxious about the midterm essay and some other assignments i completed i still worry about the quality of work but i think i did what the instructors wanted i just hope its good enough to keep my grades up i read the assigned chapter on meter and rhythm this is the most confusing part for me so i hope i can work something out husband will be cooking steak so i just need to come up with a side dish i have not napped here since ive been here and i usually sleep much more than 8 hoursa night somehow im risking all the edges of my deep fears getting up so late can backfire terribly i should not go back to sleep after im woken i have schizoaffective disorder and am 46 yrs old i have so much going on in my head and heart but not able to put anything into words i am talking less and less to my girlfriend my parents and friends its as if all the stuff id like to talk about but cant is accumulating in my brain but i dont know where to start or how to start talking about it i have schizoaffective disorder and im a 46 year old male i havent been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder actually ive never received a diagnosis of any kind i once was given the mmpi to complete one of the findings i recall was that i exhibited schizoid ideation whatever that means no one ever told me i dont talk about anything either im prettymuch reclusive and i dont watch the news on tv or read newspapers so i dont have much of anything to talk about im mostly cut off from the outside world and i dont talk about anything related to my mental health struggles its all so complicated  some of it would be downright humiliating to talk about so i just keep it all to myself but sometimes it begins to feel like the buildup of steam in a pressure cooker oh  im pushing 70 hartbroken i enjoyed adult selective mutism for a little over one year that is i did not speak for one year i didnt even know that there was a selective mutism section here its so rare among adults what you describe doesnt really sound like selective mutism at least not as i experienced it in my situation i could have spoken i didnt lack the ability or words to express myself i just chose not to from what youve written it appears that youre having trouble expressing yourself to others i dont know what could cause that do you see a therapist or psychiatrist went to a park after breakfast and took pictures it was nice outside and not too hot there were a lot of photographers out so it was fun talking about what they like in photos and what not came home and anxiety kicked in so i laid down thinking itll be an hour or two woke up at 3 pm still had to finish my team homework assignment but i got it done now debating what to make for dinner my husband is now taking a nap and i dont know when hell wake up what we originally planned for dinner needed to start this morning i also still need to take a shower but i may do that after dinner im kind of nervous but ill probably feel better in a little bit just need to relax feeling down today i have zero motivation and there are so many things to do i dont know whether this lack of motivation is my depression and anxiety or the meds i take whatever the causeim sick of it im giving up days months and years of my life to this i feel like just giving up there are no answers what can i do hope everybody is doing ok and hugs to all those that are struggling hello and hugs to those that need them took a shower and went to church had lunch after that and did a lot of reading i was feeling anxious after church but decided to read and relax it seemed to have helped im still tired but not enough for a nap husband is sleeping now and ill wake him up shortly hes making this funky teriyaki chicken fried rice thing for dinner ive been helping with ideas and timing the cats are fed and dishes put away will do laundry either tomorrow or tuesday depending on when the kids want to do laundry i moved my photos from my camera to the computer but didnt work on them due to pain in my neck and shoulders so far im doing okay still jittery but okay im not anxious exactly more restlessshaking my legs and feet had an argument with my daughter last night not really an argument more her telling me i should try harder and i should be recovered by now i was so upset i took some klonopin and went to bed i must have taken too many because i couldnt wake up this morning hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling i wasnt overly anxious today by the way of panic attacks i didnt have any panic attacks today at all actually however i was kind of paranoid but i didnt feel that anxious when i was paranoid so im honestly not sure if anxiety is causing it or if it is something else hi all i had been isolating myself for so many years due to my chronic social anxiety that i was becoming so depressed and very close to suicide i decdied to do something about it and started going back to my mental health clubhouse where i have known alot there for years but would only drop in once a year or so i am now going on 4 days straight there its nice you get a free cup of coffee in the morning and lunch is only 50 and they have a free salad bar if you have no money and a snack bar to buy snacks and the day is structured around a work order day where u can work in the kitchen or in business doing data entry or reception answering phones there are alot of jobs and things to do and if u cannot or do not feel comfortable working they do not make you it runs from 7am till 330pm and they have people who will take you to the pharmacy to pick up meds and just a number of things they help you with they even have a small clothing store in the club where u can purchase clothes for a quarter each monday tomorrow will be day 4 and it feels so good to break out of my self made prison at home and get out i got to the point that i knew i was dying and was going to die and was getting super super depressed staying in the same clothes on the couch doing nothing everyday and just alone with my own thoughts and i decided i had to make a drastic change no matter how hard it would be i am no where near well but i am now trying to break out of that shell and trying hard not to be afraid of people and talking and realizing that i am just as valuable as they are this has been so good for my mental health and has got me eating on a regualr basis too because i am getting a decent lunch each day going there today i feel good about the changes i am making and i look forward to any feedback or advice or suggestions anyone else has about breaking out of the isolation and socializing  i could have written your post except the part about the mental health club for me its been going to the library with the express purpose of checking off my work task list i know how you feel i think the pain of staying the same outweighed the pain of changing for both of us heres to change seesaw overslept today so i didnt make it to the clubhouse today but tomorrow is another day and i am still feeling positive made it to clubhouse today i was one in three that showed up one of our major busses in this town was shut down due to the weather and so only three of us showed up but i was proud of myself for getting out of the house and not isolating myself another day tomorrow this is great unfortunately sometimes when it comes to socializing we have to take risks i dont generally have social anxiety in the normal sense but i dont like putting myself in uncomfortable situations i hang out with my friends a lot but theyre my friends i am less comfortable when it involves hanging out with people i dont know such as my friends bringing along their friends theres been times its worked out great and other times ive regretted it unfortunately its the only way we are ever going to meet new people though and risks will have to be taken what youre doing is great though and i hope youll meet some really awesome people first you should know that lice is really not a big deal of course anxiety doesnt allow that kind of thinking what i would suggest is buying a kit from the store to treat you and your girl friend for lice wash your sheets and clothes then relax for me at least that would give peace of mind another route would be asking your doctor to check for lice if you arent sure but you can find tutorials on youtube i was stopped by a couple people who tried to scam me with some fake antique coins although thats only an assumption on my part i was honest and helpful until they actually started talking about money at which point i hastily retreated after that i felt like  fortunately it was at the beginning of my daily walk which i sorely needed but i thought about going back home i was so rotten and you might think that its an unlucky exception but actually ive ever only been stopped by rude or unpleasant people and never for anything fun or useful i think part of it is just the way it works also my social anxiety makes pretty much any interaction with a stranger unpleasant and maybe it has a bit to do with living in russia which is notorious for grumpy people in certain circles i just started thinking how id avoid that crap is it better to lie that im in a hurry or i had this outlandish idea apologize in a foreign language which i actually speak of course although that seems a bit too extreme if not completely impossible in my state and i also dont look like a foreigner if that makes sense i also feel a lot like stopping walks and hiding at home again but that is bad for me however its no good if i have to relax after an activity that i was supposed to do to relax i guess i should come to think of it i always keep stopping well i kind of often walk in deserted areas although today its not the excuse but still it was me those two guys and an empty street i guess its an even better excuse to keep going i mean they cant have done to me anything worse behind my back than what they tried face to face ugh i get people trying to stop me downtown all the time i just keep walking most people do with all the people handing you cds or asking for money dont feel bad you dont owe anyone a response the thing is that i normally work from home but to make the office appear full for an audit they want me to come out for 2 days on 1920 apart from any other issues ive previously had panic attacks when i worked at the office at the start and i hate this job in general and it seems they dont particularly appreciate me either but also ive been surviving thus far by being able to listen to stuff on headphones while i work and i suspect i wont be allowed any such luxuries since its an audit so itll be just me and my demons its just 17 hours combined 6 hours of commute which might be worse since i dont know what the public transport conditions are at those hours nowadays and yet im damn terrified im also probably not going to eat at work because it makes me anxious eating around other people  other bodily functions oh not to mention that i regularly suffer from insomnia and lately havent been getting up that early anyway which im sure will add another layer to this  sandwich so wish me luck well its going to be  indeed ive been trying to change my sleep schedule and failing badly ive been falling asleep around midnight for a couple hours to then stay awake until around 5 again going to bed getting up around 78 to an alarm clock having breakfast to try to reset my internal clock then crashing until noon exhausted except today i havent even been able to fall asleep at midnight in short theres no way ill be functional at the required hours on the other hand i expect that my social anxiety and awareness will be numbed from being sleep deprived or maybe i wont feel sleep deprived because of anxiety well im going to stock up on stimulants which is probably going to be primarily dark chocolate unless i see anything better gotta get high before i go down  double post thats unfair pc when i have anxiety for this kind of thing i wish you the best of luck and hope it goes by quickly sending big hugs its over it actually went pretty smoothly at least on the outside i know that usually the reality is never as bad as your fears or at least my fears but its very hard to take this to heart or maybe im managing because i acted in some ways as if nothing really bad could happen such as leaving before everyone else although you have to consider the fact that i dread going home alongside almost complete strangers opened up my school elearning site i have to email a question or two to my poetry class instructor and i have to write a shakespearean style sonnet this is going to be fun went to another park this morning chipmunks were everywhere it was so cool also accidentally disrupted a softshell turtle from his morning out in the sun sorry about that turtle not too many butterflies out in the butterfly house but its still early anxiety kicked in around 1130 am picking up my new meds wednesday but wont get the latuda until next week ugh feeling really good today took a shower then went to float in the sunshine about to clean house and my bedroom yay im out of the recliner i am diagnosed with social anxiety disorder i thought i had depersonalisation disorder and general anxiety disorder but every psychiatrist i went to see told me that i had social anxiety and depersonalisation was a symptom of it ive been taking prozac for the past few months and it has been great i used other drugs before but none have had positive effects ever but with prozac i feel like another person now i am so much more talkative and a lot more relaxed sure i still have attacks sometimes but those dont bother me now and theyre not that strong now but daily stress wow thats over like a shelter in my brain shut tight i dont care anymore and i am a brand new person i even have a job that is all about talking to people ive never met like all day and im not bothered heres the thing although prozac has made me a better version of myself ive drugtaking problems honestly first few months ive been good i took every single day the amount that my pych told me to but today while drunk i took more i swear i have no idea why i may have wanted to see what happens this is not the first time im doing this ive never been suicidal my entire life i just want to take more also i know that this ssri is so good to me so theres no way that im stopping but i know that i should stop taking more than my psyc recommends also im developing a drinking problem hadnt had this in like two or three months i know i need help but my closest visit to my psychologist is like three weeks later and my psychiatrist prescribed 6 boxes of prozac and told me off till january so i cant really seek pro help right now so yeah help i know i need it i know its been awhile since you posted how are you doing im sorry you are experiencing this difficulty i wish i had a good suggestion for you here but i dont think i do might it be possible to give your meds to a family member to hold for you  just give you the amount you need to take each day i also wondered about the possibility of getting in touch with the mental health professionals in your life to let them know whats going on with you i know you wrote youve never been suicidal in your life but my own experience suggests to me that you may be building up to something here hopefully im wrong but the taking of more medication than youre prescribed plus the drinking sounds sortof like a kind of thinly disguised self abuse to me and again my own personal experience suggests to me that this sort of thing can be a harbinger of things to come again hopefully im just wrong about this but in my own case these are the sorts of things that eventually led to allout attempts to end my life each little thing inofitself didnt seem all that big a deal at the time but in retrospect i can now see where it was all leading anyway hopefully im just completely off the mark here but i felt like it was worth mentioning i wish you well did a bunch of homework and three loads of laundry today had to stop because my neck and shoulders hurt so i read for a little bit managed to stay focused so i didnt feel the anxiety this time got a sore on my right leg that stings a bit my husband thinks it may be a spider bite i dont seem to have any other issues except it hurts and its a little red i usually have a spotted rash but not this time i didnt feel it until last night when it was itching keeping an eye on it just in case feel a bit nervous im starting to get a bit anxious about starting my new job tomorrow what will it be like how will i arrange the rest of my routine around it i dont know yet and its unnerving i really dont like people but they are drawn to me i am really bubbly and smiling laughing all the time only on the outside my life is so beautiful yet the ultimate disaster im completely lost alone stressed needing help on the inside but you will never see it looking at me

interior are so much at odds me too somehow ive ended up in a job where im with a lot of people all day long its been good for me in some ways but i had to put a lot of work into managing my energy i can relate to you i dont need to be around people i dont need to be on facebook twitter or any other look at me im wonderful websites im only on pc and im 100 ok with that people in real life have done nothing for me they just pull me into their chaotic endless drama thats why i cut them all off thats why people like you and me are at our best when were not drowning in the sea of everyones mess they call life toodles im very similar i tend to care about people and want to help them but i dont understand them at all at i feel ok in a small group of people where everyone has passed my dangertrust test but at the end of the day i need a lot of time on my own only then i can fully relax and be myself when im with people all i can think of is how not to embarrass myself and what are they thinking of me so i go to a new tdoc tuesday my current tdoc checked into her and said it looks like shed be a good fit im also trying to get an appt with a new pdoc affiliated with a private mental health facility here in town im going to see if it would help for me to go inpatient come off everything and start fresh cant keep going in and out of these attacks and depressions hope everyone is ok and hugs for those that are struggling do you think therapy could help with this i hope you get this resolved best wishes so in english we were set up in groups to talk about the book we read wed have to go up in front and speak and of course i was feeling like i couldnt do it but only one person from my group showed up so i just got up and did it yes it was only one person and my teacher so people would think this isnt that bad i got about half way through i still wanted to break down into tears i was shaking and it was hard to talk but i got through it i really dont know how i did it but i did and ill never have to do it ever again in my lifehopefully i dont know if this will help at all but it might so i want to share with you i dont talk much especially not in situations that are difficult such as therapy i have been with my current therapist a year now and still have sessions where i do not utter a word but we have found ways of working around this a huge part of me is living in a huge amount of fear too so i know it can be a terrible terrible world in the first instance i took in some writings and showed them to my t so she knew some of what i was dealing with as a client so she knew what i was looking for in a therapist patient quiet calm understanding use of nurturing touch when ready etc etc after that first session i know we spent several in a lot of silence and it is important to find a therapist that is comfortable with this because a lot a lot are not she tried to find ways of interacting with me and it worked slowly but surely she is used to working with children so i think that helped and we just sat and looked at flashcards or passed a ball between us played hunt the thimble played a game where i had to guess what i was holding without looking at it that took some trust that she didnt have anything horrible in her bag played a game where we drew shapes and the other had to make a picture out of it basically just interacting and through this there was a need for a few innocuous words to be spoken it helped after a while we found that i find writing things down much easier and so now i bring in things that i have written and will either read them or give them to her to read aloud mostly i also write instead of talking so some sessions she will be the only one using her voice as i write replies or comments it is very very very slow going so you really need a patient therapist but it is possible i had a therapist when i was 14 but the only thing they kept saying was i cant help you if you wont talk i took that to mean that i had to talk to be helped but i know differently now there is a way around this any therapist who says that is in my opinion substandard it is their problem their inability their uselessness as a therapist because it is they who cannot find a way to access this client to reach them to help them hope that helps in some way and please feel free to pm me if you would like any more info i dont know if i have selective mutism but i do choose not to talk an awful lot of the time when most probably would so i guess it would fit finished my homework for the week went to dermatology appt she gave me cortisone cream for my forehead and a pill to try and counter the mites im also getting a patch test done next month to see if my skin is sensitive to common chemicals in lotions shampoos etc itll be interesting to see that one spent about two hours waiting for meds got all of them except the pill for the mites that may be in by friday chilling out before making dinner anxiety was there at midday but not as bad i now have the lower dose of latuda so will see if that does anything didnt do too bad today but i have had a headache all day so that didnt help the lower dose of latuda seems to work i wasnt anxious that much but i was more tired worked a little bit on the photos but didnt get too far making dinner soon i took some advil for the headache but it hasnt kicked in ugh oh man i can relate to this ive always been extremely antisocial introverted depressed and never considered myself to be a people person but it seemed like everyone had high praises for me whenever i was working customer service boss fellow employees and customers themselves the only reason i pursued engineering is because i wanted to be in a field away from customers lol apparently my mixture of mellowness and straighttothepoint nature puts a lot of people at ease in reality im successfully trying to divert their attention away from me and towards the task at hand or their own personal life i guess its just because i listen more than i talk before engineering i looked into communications just to figure out how to talk to people because i was just that introverted i didnt like people growing up so i thought that if i just learned how to talk more i could meet better people but everyone seems to agree the ironic key to good communication is better listening skills so unless there is a goal in mind or someone else starts the engagement i dont want to break the ice maybe im too judgemental too shy dont know what to say or i just want to keep the nice silence ive gotten over some of my anxiety around people as i slowly realized just how much people dont notice or care about anything but themselves not saying everyone is narcissistic but that we all live in our own bubble of a brain and its difficult to interact outside of it ie everyone is their own island but i still dont like engaging with people on the off chance that i have to talk about my own personal life and bad situation  i think ive turned a corner with my depression and anxiety ive been up and out doing things with no anxiety i cried buckets of tears this week and it was cathartic im ready to let my daughter go i am at peace i feel good today hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling been busy today with getting groceries and waiting to pick up the antimite med food was expensive but we got it covered for a while the antimite med is weird i have to take six pills thankfully theyre small on an empty stomach like 1 hour before a meal i also have to order the next batch next wednesday since the pharmacy didnt order enough im anxious about next week fireworks arent my friends just coming through a period of severe depression and anxiety as ive saidim tired of this roller coaster ive scheduled an appointment with a new therapist since my old one is closing her practice and im going to get a second opinion from another psychiatrist have so much to catch up on hope everyone is ok and hugs for those that are struggling the anxiety around this impending move nov 1st is subsiding with each hurdle jumped and cog in the wheel turned towards it happening it now really seems to be a reality the primary anxiety stemmed from a worry about an interruption to my mental healthcare that has been overcome check funds for the deposit and move itself check and several more checks to the list too well now i have been able to confirm that i will still qualify for my disability assistance until and during such time i transition back into the work place big check i am giving myself the freedom now to be somewhat relieved  and a whole lot happy i hope the move is hassle free or as hassle free as possible just im overly anxious to see my therapist today my therapy center receives state funding and my state government is shut down so some things are closed the newspaper said human services are open and the lady at the hotline my therapy center runs said she is probably in but im still a little fearful ill get there only to find an empty office i wish this anxiety would pass my stomach is in a knot i want to thank everybody for their encouragement and support when i wanted to give up the other day i really appreciate it youre a great group of people prolonged exposure therapy could help it would also help to talk about handling fears with your therapist i hate needles i cant stand to look when im getting blood drawn or when i need an iv the lab techs and nurses are good about letting me know when it happens so it isnt a surprise i hear you i went to bedfeeling tired and allbut then a thought popped into my head that is giving me total and complete anxiety and that led to another thoughtthings i need to take care of and the situations im dreading so much and so afraid of the outcomes that im having a fullblown anxiety attack and cant sleep i know i just need to go deal with these two things  one is signing my new lease and the other is calling the irs to deal with a back tax issue oh and calling ssa to deal with my medicare enrollment i know that once i deal with these issues that it will be fine its nothing i cant handlebut im so afraid that the outcome will somehow equate to my death and demise and the loss of everyone and everything i care aboutanywaysits keeping me up and i really need the sleep i have a rough week of deadlines ahead of me before i go away for the holidays seesaw strong anxiety again tonight i was off work sick a few days last week so its been five days at home the sitting at home alone has raised my anxiety not enough distractions and it makes it harder to go back to work tomorrow also those issues havent gotten 100 better yet but i feel a pressure that i have to go to work tomorrow to call in sick again i wouldve had to get a doctors note on friday and i didnt because i was sure id be better by monday and also because i dont want to go to a doctor with vague symptoms also havent been sleeping well all week which adds to my night time anxiety i went ice skating for an hour this morning and i felt tired all day afterwards logically i should have no trouble sleeping tonight but i have this strange body which sometimes even cant sleep because of yoga class in the evening i tried so hard i had my usual evening ritual of writing in my journal and then getting ready for bed i decided not to take my phone with me into the bedroom to use in case i couldnt sleep  because that would be assuming the worst and now here i am sitting on my couch and almost shaking so tired but feel too nervous to sleep  having digestion issues not sure if those issues are causing the nerves or if the nerves are causing the issues i just feel sooooooo tired and want to sleep chewing on some ginger hope thatll make me feel better sorry to hear that seems like just prolonging the agony my t has suspected that i may be on the asd spectrum too coincidentally and works with a few kids with it i believe fingers crossed he is understanding and fingers crossed your daughter can see him soon and start to build that relationship having days where you feel like you cant even get up let alone leave the house is horrible really horrible i am lucky in some respects that i live alone for a lot of the time so can do what i wantneed though sometimes that isnt a good thing hi lavender i am a 57 year old woman and i suffer from the same symptoms as your daughter i used to be before the depression anxiety sleep disorder and also a bad case of hypothyroidism which has its own nasty corollaries an outgoing social person especially gifted at selling high end jewelry i was outdoorsy loved to travel alone often and excelled at making friends now i am isolated almost all of the time i am married but never had any childreni met my husband fairly late in life he is generally kind but very much a workaholic and not good at expressing or dealing with emotions he is remarkably unaffectionate and that really doesnt help i can understand where your daughter is coming from so well a gentle touch is what is needed lots of reminders of how much she is loved and supported by you makes an awful lot of difference i too become physically ill abdominal pain headaches and surprisingly powerful lower back pain have all been experienced when i have social interactions to attend on those occasions wild horses could not get me out of the house i have access to a wonderful gentle therapist but going to spend sessions with her has become so painful i can no longer bring myself to go yes i understand it is a resource i should not squanderand yes this causes me anxiety as well over the guilt i feel being trapped in this vicious cycle is to me often worse than the depression itself no i do not have one single explanation for its arrival in my life i think of it as i think of my depression brain chemistry running a little amuck there is no external single cause yes it all makes me very lonely at times but i am comfortable and safe in my home and for now thats how it has to be for me fortunately in my case i have an artistic side and do often naturally enjoy lots of time to myself in peace and quiet so its perhaps not as crippling a situation for me as it might seem on the surface i have taken baby steps to help myself and my medication does a bit for me in that way the most help i have gotten is talking with others about this and realizing i am not alone an 8week cbt course was also useful to me but came with its own share of difficulties some of the techniques i learned in it were very helpful however and do still help me now a few years on there is supposed to be an anxiety workbook famous because of its blue cover and wellreceived by therapists which has helped a great many people that may be a place to start i wish i could be more help but i wanted to reach out to let you know that it happens to very lovely peopleit is no fault of yours or hersand that little by little her pain and confusion can be greatly lessened and even possibly cured lots of people deal with this there is hope especially as she is so much younger than me and not yet soured or cynical about some things wishing you both all the best hopefully things will get better not worse i dont have any real words of wisdom but i hope you have some friends who are supportive of you that you can speak with i have learned that more people out there have anxiety about one thing or another than they let on so i have dealt with social anxiety disorder for as long as i remember i was officially diagnosed until a few years but i knew that i had it since i was a kid but anyways in school i have to do presentations and it causes me to have panic attacks which cause me to blank out and freeze and then i lose marks for my presentation so i have an iep and one of my accommodations is allowing me to do presentations privately for teachers but whenever i do teachers guilt me to present in front of the class saying you presented so well or people would love to listen to this or your presentation is so interesting that people will enjoy it or something along these lines and it frustrates me i know people may love it or that i presented so well but thats because i am accommodated if i am not i get severe panic attacks the last time i had a performance for my exam i just ended up taking my medication before my presentation and it seemed to help at least the preperformance anxiety but i hate being guilted into doing presentations for the classpeers as it makes me extremely anxious people just dont understand that this isnt something i can control or want i am a lot better than i was years ago but still have a long way to go in terms of treatment oh yeah totally understand if it were me id feel like i had to do it to please the teacher and that would cause me even more stress thinking id let them down it is annoying but you just have to do whats best for you i find people do have real difficulty understanding mental illness unless theyve experienced it i think they are just trying to encourage you in case you want to try itnot to guilt you into doing it if you dont want to what they realize is a lot of jobs later in life require some presentation skills so its a good thing to learn but if you cant then dont feel bad about it scarlett35 hi scarlet im wondering if you could practice with a few ppl perhaps family or close friends that would help get started if you did one good presentation it would give you the confidence to keep going i used to be similar and i started to learn off my presentations by heart and gained confidence that way i needed to attend a wedding shower last night my husband didnt tell me until the last minute that worked out ok this time i didnt have enough time to go over all the what ifs in my head until i get there then i didnt know but one couple and i stayed off to myself until we could leave im hoping the extra anxiety ive been having the past week will go away as i get more used to prozac i think the anxiety definitely started after the prozac was increased i wish i could watch tv here id have to turn the volume way up to hear it and id have to sit right in front of the tv to read the captions i wish i were out in space with unlimited food drinks and snacks and a big flat screen tv and netflix and hulu its a good thought anyway my mom is sick and im very anxious abt thismy therapist says to concentrate on the progress she is making but i cant stop feeling worriedwhat can i do to bring myself back to normalcy so that i can care for her better anxiety wins i had an important meeting today and i emailed them last night to cancel everything about that situation was giving me anxiety and i felt completely sick my therapist and i had gone over a planstrategy to get me through it but i tossed that aside instead ive laid in bed under my weighted blanket petting my dog avoiding the world ive learned that some days are like this i chose not to fight my anxiety today and thats okay tomorrow is a new day sharing this in case you get hard on yourself like i normally do we will all have bad days and its okay sometimes strength is knowing when you just need a little more self love you can try staying in the present moment so youre not thinking about the past or future this will help you tremendously im starting to watch videos on youtube on mindfulness meditation i think it will help you im sorry shes sick i went through this with my mom i think allowing yourself to be sad is helpful too so many times we repress our feelings and i think that causes more problems than we need i wish you many days of joy ahead you can look for the good in each day and make great memories wherever possible xo i hear you yesterday was one of those days for me thank you for posting this im living in a new town and in dire need of friends i cant stand feeling so isolated but all i can think about is what might go wrong imaginary arguments with imaginary strangers its making me crazy i hope you can make some new friends are there group activities you can join for me it helped to join a club soccer team because i could focus on soccer but still be around people i know that it is hard to meet new people when you have social anxiety i went to a lunch last week for teachers at my school and ended up talking to a new teacher i was hating it on the inside but managed it by asking her lots of questions i agree that joining a group can take the spotlight off you and allow you to make friends thats what helped me make friends good luck making friends sending big hugs glad it helped you jennifer the cold has advanced to headache sore throat and now a runny nose and watery eyes thankfully the kids are over it so it should go away here soon the supplies for the roof came in this afternoon unfortunately the weather isnt cooperating rain today and tomorrow sunny for the weekend then rain on monday and tuesday so im crossing my fingers and toes for wednesday i finished my homework for the week good thing because im not thinking very well with this cold raging on anxiety is up a little biti wish i could quit worrying about getting everything right soive suffered from social anxiety years before iknew what it was i just knew iwas extremely shy to the point of being afraid 18 now im well aware of what it is and have tried therapy medications and self medicating everyone makes me uncomfortable friends family my boyfriends over the years one friend ive known for over 6 years and still there are times when even she makes me uncomfortable the depression accompanying my anxiety and to help it suffocate me i just wanna breathe again ive always wanted to be a social butterfly and love meeting new people for the first time but after the first few times i start to feel obligated to have that person in my life though i cant bring myself to socialize regularly sometimes i really hate myself because im sure people think i feel some way towards them but its all in my head i can talk to my boyfriend at times about how im feeling i like that he always reponda with i understand and it makes me feel good then i start thinking does he really or is he just saying that to sooth whatever anxious feelings im having so we dont have to continue talking about it i feel like a consistent burden to him with a fear of people i almost never feel theres any reason to keep going hi socialhandicap101 im sooo sorry to hear how youre feeling however you are not alone most ppl will feel awkward in company at some point or time in their lives they just cover it up better than the rest of us do the fact that your boyfriend stays around means that you are more than your social anxiety he sees beyond your anxiety and loves you regardless im wondering if you have tried any therapies like homeopathyacupunctureeft etc etc any of these are bound to help as well as the talking therapies roofers came out to do a small part today theyre going to work the weekend so they have better weather neighbor has her dogs loose off her yard and of course they run to where the roofers are then she walks through my yard with her dogs on a leash i wonder if this is a battle worth fighting because she isnt even supposed to have dogs there at all according to the hoa rules weve gotten hit with stuff from the hoa so dont know if i want to make a bad situation worse cold is getting worse the pain has spread to my lower sinuses and i can barely breathe through my nose going to be real fun with the cpap we may have leftovers tonight or go out to eat unless i can convince my husband to make spaghetti probably not at least i was able to relax and read today anxiety is up but it should go away in a little while  hope you feel better soon and breathing gets easier i dont like feeling pressured to go places no one around me really gets me i truly feel that way im just not capable of doing what other people can do it is what it is if youve known me for years it should be obvious by now i cant handle what the average person can handle i am weak and i am afraid its the way i have always been no surprises there its like i was just built to break i dont have any mental health problems diagnosed anyway related to this but i think i might have social anxiety but im not sure i am not sure if it is normal but i am in the same boat i guess i have friends but they are friends where we are together like at work i have a hard time meeting people it is awkward and i dont know what to say to me there are two types of friend  communication one seems so superficial hi how are you hows the family how was whatever the second is intiment not like talking about sex but whats inside how i really feel but can you join a group that does something that interests you do you already have something in common it probably be pretty safe and you can work through some of the anxiety i understand that feeling lotusblossom i used to be able to but after the breakdown im as fragile as spun glass anxiety level is rather high today it was bad enough that i was shaking involuntarily enough that others noticed one asked what was wrong all this because i put myself in a social situation i really didnt want to be in still it was the right thing to have done i just loathed doing it i was quite anxious earlier today this is unusual as i have happily been anxiety free for months while yes i have been nervous or on occasion worried it is the numbing disabling anxiety that occurred this morning basically i volunteered for a large event it turned out i was redundant while the job really only required one person there were four of us present which meant standing around stupid yes but such situations make me anxious part of it is that i dont want to be seen to be standing around doing nothing it is so unprofessional part of it too is that the silly chit chat that occurs in such situations makes me uncomfortable i feel like such a tool i was getting overwhelmed so i asked to go home but this wasnt entirely a relief as i feel guilty for bailing on the others still sick now with a cough im hopeful because usually when i start coughing the cold is just about over roofers finished the back part of the house theyre doing the front tomorrow hopefully before the storms hit in the late afternoon spent most of the day reading i finished one book but i still have a few i havent read yet daughters boyfriend is making spaghetti for dinner its good because i can use some comfort food without me sniffling over the stove anxiety is okay considering physically i feel like crap its back to the event later this morning and i am not doing well i am apprehensive and bracing myself for disaster in reality i know it should be better as i am actually scheduled to perform specific activities and tasks still i worry about my ability and performance i have such a high standard of perfection for myself i must remember i am only just a volunteer actually started feeling better this afternoon i missed church this morning though because i wasnt feeling that well roofers are still working they were halfway done on the back and they are also working on the front hope they will be done here soon because were supposed to get rain tonight did a bunch of homework for my orientation class i also looked over the weeks work for my poetry class i should knock that out in a day or so anxiety isnt too bad just what i usually have for doing homework worrying if i had done it right pretty soon itll be finals week i havent been here in a long time but ive been doing relatively well and am going up the latter at my job and have been talked to a couple times about becoming a manager but im not sure i want that or not gives me a lot less anxiety over if im gonna be in trouble or something which never happens but still then it means i have to set an example for everyone else and be in charge which im not good at im good at my job but just because of my ability to disassociate when i do things i dont like i can do it for hours pretending to care about the customers at all and robotically moving around anyways im back because im having my first bout of anxiety in a while started getting nauseous again and cant sleep hoping i will be back to normal in the morning the large fair i volunteered at has come to an end i was anxious through most of it sure working the childrens activities was fun but i had a tremor so bad people commented on it homework is almost done except for one piece that im waiting on others for roofers are almost done they have one piece left hope it doesnt rain too bad still havent picked another book yet but i have plenty ive been eating crazy amounts of food today been wound up a bit trying to calm back down not as anxious as usual today i think the extra xanax my doctor gave me is helping a bit had a panic attack yesterday but i know what it can be attributed toan overwhelming to do list separation anxiety from my daughter and my car breaking down when i know ill need it to take my daughter to orientation next monday and tuesday im a little on edge right now hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling im 48 years old ive lived my entire life feeling stresseduncomfortableawkwardsad i now suffer from ulcerative colitis  hypertension  sleep disorders the cumulative effect of these issues have left me feeling hopeless im pretty much living just waiting to die ive had a little therapy but didnt see it helping now i feel ashamed that im so mentally weak dont see any way possible to get better robert hello robert this appears to be your first thread here on pc so welcome to psychcentral im

the basement which is on the other side of my front door both of these doors are loud enough loud enough to not be drowned out by the tv i feel so broken down and helpless its just making the anxiety worse i just want to be left alone but im scared someone will come over bit anxious today classmates still havent done their input for the team assignment its due tonight at 1130 pm i hope they jump in because i may end up doing all the work myself if they dont roofers didnt finish yet theres two small areas to knock out though so itll be done in the morning kids are back and watching the office husband is cooking pork chops tonight having bad anxiety and panic attacks today as it gets closer to my daughter leaving for college the more anxious i get am trying coping techniques and they are not working neither is my medication i feel paralyzed with fear right now hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling my anxiety was bad this morning i couldnt sleep for a while we had a bad thunderstorm move in overnight and this morning it took out the transformer for the building we were without power for about 4 hours i couldnt sleep until it came back on and its left me feeling off all day i feel awful when i get them too sorry they have come back for you hope they stop soon take care one classmate just checked in she doesnt understand the assignment i hope i explained it to her dont know if shell get it before friday when we have to post our conclusions to the whole class i have a feeling im going to do all the legwork this makes me nervous otherwise its been a quiet day did some reading made dinner still have to take a shower in a bit anxiety is up but to be expected at this moment and the roofers are finally done now we have to pay for it everyone im anxious to see my therapist this happens every week i dont get why im even scared i guess i just dont trust her yet also im afraid of working through my trauma and my trauma gives me anxiety okay so i guess i do get why im scared i just needed to type that out im sorry youre having a tough time would a therapist be helpful in processing some of this things can get better thinking of you its a new group an old friend created it for an event hence i get to talk to new people i decided topicrelated to advertise a remix i made and asked to like and subscribe the video if they liked the remix i also said i will also gladly accept criticism with a smiley i got no responses and started overthinking probably out of anxiety did they not like it did my message look like one of those spam messages some people send to many groups at once from this point i will say i did intend to personally share it with the new group though i wanted to fulfill my interest of growing my subscription number to fulfill a current desire to be recognized for what i do do they think im selfish now was my message garbage am i garbage or selfish for sharing my remix this way i feel kinda garbage after seeing no one responding you can post your remix here and i will definitely give you feedback i am an edm djproducer as well as mobile dj thanks i appreciate it however its not the issue but the whole package of stressful thoughts i had yesterday feeling better today no anxiety and my daughter is 2 hours away at six flags with her friends she stayed on the mountain with her father last night and im doing ok i think the anxiety will probably come and go until ive fully adjusted but i feel hopeful today that it wont kill me hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling glad youre feeling better jennifer today was mostly stress eating that sucks my classmate finally chimed in on the team assignment and i have another part done ill turn in the class assignment tomorrow ive been rather nervous since both my daughter and my husband were at school most of the morning i dont know why its hitting now since its now over halfway through the term doing well today so far went down to the pool early this morning and floated while i mapped out my day in a pretty good and have motivation and energy today to tackle my to do list fingers crossed hope everyone is doing well and hugs for those that are struggling and i spoke to soon i am having a panic attack anxiety im afraid and have an impending sense of doom i am paralyzed with fear and have a sense of dread about being unable to do anything i think it will come and go until i adjust if i could just overcome this fear and start doing something i think id be ok i hate anxiety thanks for bearing with me she leaves the 23rd and ill start adjusting hope everyone is doing well and hugs to all those that are struggling took a shower and went to church this morning picked the chicken from last night and did homework until dinner time anxiety is up still i think i did the assignment for orientation correctly but my writing is now horrific and it hurt my hand to write notes for over four hours we werent allowed to use the computer to write up our notes i still should be okay looked at poetry class assignment  final exam is another 700 word essay i dont remember a final for the orientation class just chilling out now will venture back into the fray tomorrow after i get the patches put on in the morning my anxiety has lasted for a few hours now it wont go away i will take my medication in hopes that it will help alleviate my anxious self i tried using all sorts of coping skills but it hasnt helped a source of new anxiety for me is that now that were 3 in one room theres no where left for doing a quick washing up the bathroom has 5 or 6 people having to juggle and decide when and where to do our washing up i really wish i could go home or to that assisted living place if its horrible there maybe i can hire a lawyer to see what i can do i really hope this isnt the end of my life but if it is at least it isnt that far away to wait hi guys i just signed in on impulse as the last week has really hit home the enormity of my situation and im wondering what to do about it well im severely socially anxious and agoraphobic i need my mother with me when im out but i also need her with me just to talk to somebody today i went to the doctors for my blood test results and a home hairdresser came for a consultation about my brass problem i feel really angry with myself about the way i talk and my body language ive known this is a problem for years but im sick and tired of it now and im desperate to get a new lease of life going i talk and act very adolescent im 27 i bumble i mumble i fidget im not articulate i look angsty and feel it too and im very uncomfortable i feel like a teen whos self conscious in her new body and angsty hormonal mind and i can feel myself displaying that body language i hunch i shuffle my feet very ungracefully practically stomp when i walk and i talk in an unclear way when im very anxious and upset i look quite severe and moody and it doesnt help that my face looks younger than i am so i feel like i just scream teenager im so scared and uncomfortable and i lack social skills i want to move and speak the way other adults do its hard to explain what i mean but i watch them i watch other women when im out they wear more grown up clothes i do love my ripped jeans and floral vans though they walk more feminine and maturely they speak clearly with no confusion no awkwardness they seem to have more grace even if theyre not graceful i think the hairdresser really reminded me of how differently i move and speak she wasnt a glamazon like many hairdressers she was a perfectly nice ordinary woman in practical day clothes but she spoke clearly she spoke confidently its hard to explain but she had that adult way that i want i want to speak clearly too i want grown up mature body language right now as i have been for over 10 years im a high school kid hunched and hiding behind her hair eyes darting around laughing nervously how can i change it im meant to be getting a support worker but its been 2 months or more and i still havent heard from anyone despite my therapists looking into it i thought maybe she could help me but i dont know how i feel like what i need is selfcontrol mindfulness a good strong dose of diazapam role play could someone work with me to help me learn body language speech social skills i see the way other people interact as adult and proper and i want to have those speech and body languages skills too like an actual functional adult but i dont know how to learn it or who can help the therapist im seeing right now is psychoanalytic on the nhs were just looking at my past ive mentioned my body languageteenage speech to others who have worked with me in the past but they just ask me what i mean by teenagery and then laugh ill stop here as i do have a habit of writing a lot hello piglette i dont know as there is much of anything tangible i could offer with regard to this but i noticed no one had replied to your post so i thought i would below are links to three articles from the psychcentral archives on the subject of building self esteem plus a link to family therapist kati mortons playlist on building selfconfidence i realize some of this may not be especially relevant to your particular situation however perhaps somewhere in this material you may find some tidbits that will be of benefit to you i wish you well wrote another 5 pages worth of notes for my orientation class have to write more tomorrow but my right hand is kind of sore nothing up for the poetry class yet i might have to do some of that work and take my chances patches are on now nothing is really itching burning or stinging but i have a day and a half more to go if something is bothering my skin it would be nice to know cant sweat a lot or take a shower for three days im hiding in our bedroom because it has a mobile ac unit and the room is kept cool sucks for sleep habits but better than doing this test again we will probably have takeout for the next few days because my husband is also doing lots of homework and neither one of us wants to cook when our brains are fried plus the kitchen gets really hot anxiety is still up but i have only a few more weeks of school and ill probably chill until next term i think i did pretty good at orientation today considering they split my daughter and i up on a campus with 30000 students the first 4 hours i was trying hard not to hyperventilate but i eventually calmed down get to go back and do it all over again tomorrow hope everyone is ok and hugs for those that are struggling since theres been a third person in our room i cant do a sponge bath in the room and its hard to use the shower but i dont shower everyday im afraid to see the shower in the assisted living place and what if theres two or more to a room there anxiety is not kicking up right now which is good because i absolutely couldnt handle both depression and anxiety right now was feeling anxious and depressed this morning but went to float in the pool that usually makes me happy and helps me work out issues hugs for all those that are struggling anxiety is the worst thing to deal with and so is loneliness which probably doesnt help the anxiety i hope all here can get through their days untouched by these 2 things i know i do it every day good luck everyone final evaluation of the patch test showed im sensitive to chamomile and similar plants and to lanolin the dermatologist emailed me a very long list of products i could use ill have to look over my products and see whats what also saw t today we talked about stuff that happened this week and how much better i am on my current meds i have been stable for about a year now as far as bipolar and borderline is concerned havent done any homework yet because of errands will do tomorrow anxiety is up a little but manageable next two weeks will be interesting to anyone who doesnt suffer from anxiety this is going to sound very pathetic i attended an appointment today ive put it off many times over the last 6 months my heart was racing my head was pounding i was sweating had a headache  was physically sick when i got to the car park i saw a very nice  kind lady yet my body reacted like i was about to get killed by a tiger after some tears  a shaking body i managed to get through the appointment i took a while to recover afterwards but i managed it im so proud of myself thank you sassandclassthe pool does calm me down and make me feel better im going to be relying on it heavily im taking my daughter to college tomorrow at this time no anxiety and depression or tears i hope that doesnt change thank you for being supportive and letting me get this out hugs for all of those that are struggling hi everyone im struggling at the moment with what i think could be some form of social anxiety and wondered if anyone had any advice i had a quick look at the forum and couldnt see anything recent that fit with my scenario please bare with me as it might take a bit of explaining since i started my masters ive been having recurring bouts of anxiety surrounding my identity not in terms of what hobbies and films etc that i like more in terms of personality when i began my masters i was thrust into a really odd environment where my old lecturers or teachers became more like colleagues i really struggled to fit in and felt like i was really boring and no one was interested in me as i result i tried everything to modify my personality to make myself more interesting so i could be loved by everyone i found certain things triggered me and it was things like watching movies where the character was well liked so for instance i love the film tangled but whenever i watched it i wanted to be like rapunzel because everyone loved her when i watch lost i want my personality to be like hurley because everyone loves him i know this probably sounds really bizarre but it honestly triggers the confusion over my identity this has been going on for about 2 years now but it makes me feel so awkward as well when im in this confusing period i dont feel very sure of myself and i feel awkward like everyone knows im being fake and not authentic i dont even know how to act when im just sitting down im worried i look awkward dont know what to do and that everyone is judging me when i talk to people im absolutely desperate to be myself but im more desperate to be liked this now not only happens with my colleagues but also with friends who i dont feel comfortable with i also find myself getting hot sweaty and nervous when im in these situations i know i have too much dependence on what other people think of me and i cant seem to shift it i think it comes from low self esteem and not thinking that im good enough trying all these different identities tires me out and at the end of the day i just want to be myself but ive worn so many personalities mine has actually got lost in there somewhere i just want to learn who i am so i can be that person or there abouts all the time when i say that to people though they say everyone acts different around different people but i feel so anxious and it seems to affect me more than other people i actually know that im probably doing a selffulfilling prophecy and that because i dont know how to act i stay quiet or am awkward and then people dont like me as much i know that if i were myself people would probably like me more anyway i also know that people wont always like me and that some dont now and that i have to just live with it i just dont know how to rediscover myself im grouchy and stuff because i dont want to live my whole life being a fake i want to be my real self and be sure of who that is and confident so i dont feel awkward i dont want to worry what others think about me but i cant stop any tips advice thank you so much hello alisando well one way to look at this is simply that graduate school is stressful and perhaps what youre experiencing is simply a symptom of high levels of underlying stress  anxiety and if thats the case then perhaps what you need to do is to focus on ameliorating this underlying anxiety if you can successfully treat that via therapy for example the concerns you have about learning who you are  being that person around other people may gradually disappear on their own beyond that you know i read a lot of posts here on pc and not an insignificant number of them involve concerns similar to yours related to how to make friends how to keep friends how to be yourself  still have friends etc i should mention im an older person now and i lead a pretty thoroughly solitary lifestyle myself it wasnt always that way so anyway ive done some thinking with regard to these types of concerns and what occurs to me is that friends comego during some periods of a persons life they may have some during other periods they may have few or none at least thats the way it was for me before i simply withdrew from the world entirely so the point to which my thinking on this subject has brought me is perhaps a person would be best served by simply forgetting about friends  instead focusing on finding something in life she is passionate about  pursuing that with abandon maybe its a vocation maybe its an avocation but whatever it is put your time  energy into that  forget about the other stuff in the end theres really no concrete answer to those sorts of concerns anyway in the course of pursuing what you love youll of necessity come into contact with likeminded people and at least a few of them are likely to become acquaintances or even friends but even if they dont youll still have the satisfaction of having dedicated yourself to something thats important to you at least these are my thoughts with regard to your post i wish you well i loved the answers thank you i do agree too i have been doing a lot of hobbies recently but i dont have too much time to do them as im so busy working on my masters the hobbies do help i took up painting recently and also had some worries about identity surrounding my art work wanting to get myself across but then also being inspired by other artists and wanting to be as good as them i think definitely the stress has really got to me im not too far from the finish line now so im hoping once its over ill feel better i just need to make sure im not people pleasing when i decide what i want to do next and do what i want to do for myself i liked what you said about having friends even when being yourself i think with the friends im talking about and the ones i feel least comfortable with we were all thrown together at school and so we have a wide range of interests and i dont feel as interesting to those people as i do to the ones i feel comfy with thank you for the reply i really appreciate it its good to vent these things sometimes i feel you lived my life the same way ive said the last few times that i am okay i have not quite been honest the truth is that i still experience bone crushing anxiety that cripples me i volunteered a few weekends ago and my anxiety impacted my ability to perform and do the job it was awful a few ore weeks ago i had some business at a bank to do for my support group i couldnt fill out any of the forms ive a camping holiday coming up and i am already anxious about getting an early start i had a function to go to yesterday and i was sick to the pit of my stomach okay though generally speaking i am quite good i am functioning well i can do my groceries or go to public places without a panic i can walk about my apartment building mail laundry etc with no problem it seems then to only be those things i am expected to perform that are causing the trouble hello just want to talk with some others about selective mutism and if it still effects you in your adult life or how its gotten easier when i was a child my selective mutism was so awful i wouldnt be able to ask to go to the toilet and would pee my pants in class when asked a question i would just sob because i was unable to speak a few times i would find things so hilarious but would not even be allowed to laugh and would just choke silently i find selective mutism to be really strange because some part of our brain is making rules for us that we have to oblige to ive never found anyone i could talk to about this properly im 21 now i still have crazy bad social anxiety and for the past  5 years or so i havent been able to make facebook statuses what about you guys hello kancles im sorry i cant comment with regard to your concerns however i noticed this is your first post here on pc so to psychcentral from the skeezyks may the time you spend here be of benefit psychcentral is a great place to get information as well as support for mental health issues the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are social groups you can join  chat rooms where youll be able to connect with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved lots of great stuff so please keep posting hi all after lots of life and therapy much of my social anxiety is mostly under control but i still have problems with when i need to talk to people from other groups at work like if i need their help i always feel like im bothering them and yet they seem to be fine and even enjoy the interaction once were talkingits clearly not a rational thought and i suppose im falling prey to mind readingcbt in thinking ahead about the interaction or what they are thinking but i was wondering if any of you have tips for when you sort or have to interact with coworkers because you need help with something hello  i know what you mean when it comes to talking to people and feel like youre bothering them i work in fast food so communication is a must in my environment so in a way i was conditioned into talking with my coworkers when i needed help but i do remember feeling nervous asking for help when i first started working and i still fall short when it comes to having casual conversations through my experience i have found that if i didnt ask for help i ended up becoming extremely flustered and anxious and i find that its not worth the trouble but when i did ask things ran much smoother and i felt happier in the end with that said i have two tips that i think will help you out first if you really need help but feel nervous talking to your coworker tell yourself that youll feel so much better once heshe responds give yourself reasons why you should ask for help inspire yourself second to start feeling comfortable asking your coworkers its best to try building a good relationship with them start by saying hello and goodbye itll make you feel more comfortable in approaching them later on and may perhaps kickstart a conversation remember even the most successful people in the world need help i really hope this helps you out with your coworkers i feel its a lot easier to talk to my coworkers then people in my group who also have mental illness i still dont talk to my coworkers a lot though if that makes sense yay i got my daughter off to college with no anxiety or panic attacks we took two cars and i did cry going and coming but i was positive and upbeat with her while we were fixing up her room then i hugged her for a long time and left i feel okay yay hope everyone is okay and hugs to those that are struggling kids came back to town with the daughters boyfriends family theyre having a funeral for the familys cat that died this weekend she was very old 19 i think and had some issues but at least now shes at peace and in no pain finished my homework for poetry class and through half of my homework for my orientation class also cleaned up the kitchen for a little bit and showed my husband how to use the convection part of our microwave been a quiet day otherwise still trying to keep the stress down since were getting closer to finals i just watch a show on the computer to keep calm some anxiety today some stressing out for starters theres that matter of payment for my kayak ive droned on about i am also finding out i need to tread lightly when it comes to talking about my coming move i really am happy about it and want to let people know but circumstances require i step rather softly we cant have my boyfriends boarder finding out before notice is required to be given the fact the boarder is best friends with some of his family members means keeping this a secret i am trying to recall to whom ive already let the cat of the bag and then there is the start of my holiday im sure ive posted somewhere on here my irritation at having a side stop thrust upon me for an upcoming road trip to our camping destination what was to be a 45hr drive has been extended to a 6 or 7 hour day and i am not happy about it i am really quite anxious about not getting an early start considering this extra travel time having a difficult time with anxiety again today i actually took my shovel and dug a drainage ditch yesterday afternoon in hopes the hard work would break me out of this it didnt i am intensely excited about moving 10 days 12 hours 34 min away did i memtion i was excited lol but i am wound up with anxiety that something is going to go wrong i wrote a little poem on selective mutism and dissociation on my activism blog tattoo reads when words become inadequate i  blogging in shadows long before i knew what the words mutism and dissociation meant i knew i used to often dream in sign language which i was never taught one of my alters mainly communicates this way still worried about my husband he overheated badly on saturday and has felt unwell since then saw his neurologist this afternoon and hell need another mri to rule out a ms flare im nervous about this because i have to drive while he is sedated i have had panic attacks driving so not a comfortable feeling i picked my poem for my final essay and found some research on it on wikipedia so now i have to figure out how to analyze it daughters boyfriends idiot brother wants to plant a marijuana seed over the familys cats grave its at his parents house so they would get in trouble for it hes really gungho about it too stupid jerk went out early for dinner to have a break food was pretty good then we just chilled out for a while other than the concerns about my husband im doing okay updatehusbands mri is on saturday i somewhat know where its at so driving back wont be an issue i hope he is starting to feel better but not out of the woods yet otherwise a slow day i started writing my outline for my final essay but having trouble concentrating anxiety is still up and when im anxious i cant focus may have to take some extra vistaril to get through this i do feel anxious for tomorrows smoke breaks cant wait but its definitely anxiety just hope the tank doesnt break no money yes but screw it i start my holiday this weekend with or without it i am not going to let it drag me down if it mean the difference between ziplining and not ziplinin so be it ill have a campfire and beach to enjoy anyway everything set up for tomorrow spent this morning writing part of my essay i figure if i can do small chunks of it ill have it done and revised before the deadline its not due until the end of next week still debating if i want to do next term i havent been used to this level of anxiety in a long time and i dont want to jeopardize my stability other than writing and three loads of laundry its been a peaceful day will be making dinner soon doing really well anxiety wise had panic attacks last monday and tuesday last weekat orientation for my daughters college but nothing since praise the good lord i hope it lasts i hope everyone is doing ok and sending big hugs for those that are struggling husband went through his mri okay we will know the results on monday right now hes sleeping off the ativan if he goes too long ill have to pick up my daughter from work and i dont know how late shes working her store stays open until 10 pm on saturdays and id rather not be on the road with a bunch of crazy drunk fools but i gotta do what i gotta do didnt work on the essay because i forgot my laptop ill skip church tomorrow to work on it anxiety is crazy high but i have extra vistaril and maybe some patience just trying to stay chill i wasnt anxious all daynow its starting to kick in and i dont wanna waste my meds so i am just gonna sit through it and wait for it to pass glad youre feeling better uhmno finished half the essay today will have more than enough words once i get done im having to miss some stuff so it wont get too wordy and long the orientation class homework isnt too bad but it will be more writing this will be a fun week making spaghetti for dinner because i want comfort food and my husband doesnt want to drive to pick up last minute stuff hes studying for his finals in fact just about everyone in the house is doing finals stuff except for the cats anxiety is still up there but im pacing myself so its manageable i noticed something interesting when i went to college orientation for those 2 days in july the parents were separated from the students within an hour of being there i had taken my anxiety meds as usual but had nothing on hand poor planning i started having terrible panic attacksshaking heart pounding shortness of breath i felt stuck i didnt want to embarrass myself or miss valuable information so i kept taking deep breathes and talking myself through it i felt it was my only option when i have anxiety or panic attacks at home or in other places i am desperate to stop it and will take enough of my prn medication to stop it i proved to myself those two days that i can work through it and dont need to feel desperate to stop it when it happens since my doctor put me on abilify ive had little to no anxiety thank the good lord but i now understand i can work through it without freaking out i n ever had too many friends and in middle school i always sat alone at lunch the truth is i really dont mind i know humans are a social species but i dont want friends i dont like socializing and i like to isolate myself in my room at home typically my parents keep bugging me to make friends and be social but the truth is thats just so stressful to me i really just prefer being on my own i recently made a friend at school and ill talk to her in class sometimes but even though we have the same lunch i never sit with her i just sit by myself and i really dont mind sitting alone is it normal to want to isolate myself so much i dont have diagnosed social anxiety but i do freeze up and get anxious talking to people i dont know hello bookworm well im an older person  i lead a prettymuch solitary lifestyle i suspect its less outoftheordinary for a person my age than it would be for a younger person i dont really know if it is normal in either case i personally dont see anything wrong or worrisome about it its just the way you  i are could it be a sign of some underlying depression  social anxiety yes i suppose it could these are things ive certainly struggled with over the years but as long as youre comfortable with the way you live your life my perspective is its perfectly fine i guess the only other consideration may be that as you plan for your future  what kinds of employment opportunities you may wish to pursue it will be important to keep your preference for keeping to yourself in mind there are certainly occupations that require a lot of interpersonal contact  others where although it may not be integral to the completion of your assigned tasks its still an important part of advancing your career homework is done for this term kids and husband took their final exams and did really well were enjoying the short breather before next term my husband and i were talking about finals anxiety and how it affects us physically as well as mentally his double vision started to kick in a remnant of his ms before his exam but he calmed himself down he wants to go on ativan but his pdoc cant do it the office also does substance abuse rehab so they dont carry it went to pain management clinic and set up an initial appointment will see them monday morning i hope they can figure something out because bending still hurts picked up groceries and did a load of laundry today still need to do some housework but not today will be making dinner shortly anxiety is not as high as it has been but i wonder if i can still do school it keeps me going and gives me structure but the anxiety is a bit trying at times not doing so well today which is a bummer the last few days have been fantastic but somehow this evening everything started to spiral out of control i feel and think my co workers are conspiring and talking about me behind my back i know this may not be true but not sure the problem with this is the thoughts lead me to become incredibly anger and i dont want to get violent based off false beliefs that really hold no weight also just a few minutes ago while smoking on my front porch i killed a black window ortho home defense works really well btw now since i have my son this weekend i cant help but to think what may have happened had he been here or what could happen this weekend just checked all shoes near the entrance door for fear spiders may be in them now i know this is going to be come something i do religiously help husband needed a slow day and thats what he got i had to take my daughter to work because he was napping so hard he wouldnt wake up thankfully talking to my daughter kept me steady but it got bad after i came home extra vistaril and laying down for a while classes for next term are paid for books are bought monthly donation to church sent making dinner in a few minutes somehow im jittery it may have been from going to the college even though my husband was with me really anxious today had been doing well for 3 weeks hope im not spiraling down maybe between my daughter being gone and my friend dying so suddenly i should expect to have a couple of down anxious days so many people are struggling sending big hugs hello this im sorry im not really able to offer anything substantive with regard to this perhaps this is all due to the effects having smoked marijuana  then stopped but i dont really know i do believe however that depression  anxiety can cause a loss of the ability to feel emotions too at least over the long term im an older person now  ive been struggling with both for a lifetime and i certainly have experienced something of this myself hopefully other members here on pc will have some better insights they can offer i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting i would recommend seeing a doctor  therapist and see what they think i use cbd oil and it does have a nice calming effect to it it takes the edge off anxiety however i use cannabis in addition to my psych meds because for me cannabis alone isnt enough i dont know about your particular autoimmune disease i do know a friend who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease when she complained to her doctor about developing psych problems he told her it was apart of the disease once she got solid on her new diet  meds it resolved sorry to hear you are having such problems yes what you are going through is very common and expected for someone who quit consuming marijuana and who has anxiety and depression withdrawal from marijuana can last up to three months and the first month can be the most intense but then it gets much better and depression and anxiety makes you numb and you do not recognize your emotions and feelings it is like a defense or something i hope you are feeling better please reach out if you want to talk more so im at a college camp thing right now and there are two dances during the stay one was yesterday and one is tomorrow they require you to attend them i already tried to get out of it and they check the bathrooms so i cant hide out in there like i usually do the dance yesterday was an absolute disaster i felt my anxiety flare up as soon as i walked in the courtyard where there were hundreds of people in a huge crowd i had an anxiety attack but managed to hide it and i ended up sitting on the side for the 2 12 hours it lasted a little flaming ball of anxiety the next dance is tomorrow and i really need some advice i honestly have no idea what to do so anything is appreciated thank you all for reading quiet day today need one after all the errands so far this week the muscle relaxer seems to work okay but had to drop vistaril so i dont end up too groggy maybe thats why im a little squirmy today dinner is cooling in the fridge so well all be eating soon hugs to those that need them so i have been dealing with social anxiety for as long as i can remember though i didnt know thats what it was at first i only have one friend and she isnt in any of my classes which makes school really hard im 17 i can barely get words out when i talk to people and i always get really flushed so anyways i am set to be valedictorian of my high school class next year and i will have to give two speeches in front of thousands and thousands of people i cant do it when i was in eighth grade we had a graduation it was a k8 school and i had to give a speech i had a panic attack right before the graduation and i started crying in front of hundreds not even thousands of people and could barely finish my speech because i started to black out i cant do this again and i dont know what to do sorry to take up your time but i really need help does anyone know what i should do hello alyhart well its been many years since i was in school and i was a long way away from valedictorian congratulations on that by the way but it seems to me you just have to tell them this is simply not something you feel capable of doing they cant force you to do it i dont believe perhaps they can find some local celebrity type person to give a rousing graduation speech in your place ive had too many experiences over the years forcing myself to do things i didnt feel capable of doing because of my own social anxiety  ending up feeling thoroughly embarrassed  foolish because it actually did turn out just as badly as i had feared it would its not worth it in my estimation but you have to be strong  not let others cajole you into doing it telling you how it will all be okay nil carborundum illegitimi of course im assuming here you really dont want to do this perhaps theres a part of you that would really like to do it in that case perhaps theres a medication you could take that would allow you to give your speeches without unravelling you could perhaps approach your family doctor about that and beyond that again if this is something you really would like to do my suggestion would be prepare your speeches well ahead of time  practice practice practice my experience was that the few times i did have to give speeches when i knew my material backwardsforwards as the saying goes it all went much better for me good luck is there a counselor at school you could talk to or a teacher you trust to let them know how you feel about this and the distress its causing if you can get someone to understand your situation maybe they can help to find a solution that works for you and when i say talk to that could also be writing it down and handing it to the person i just wanted to support you and offer best wishes in whatever you decide to do what helps you with anxiety that doesnt involve medication i have medication and an appointment w a therapist but it is two weeks away i cant pinpoint a specific moment but i think its from a combination of socially awkward and embarrassing humiliating moments from childhood and my reserved nature i remember just shutting down completely when i felt embarassed id ignore the person or distract myself with something else actually thats still a coping method that i use today haha but hmm id say the anxiety peaked for me as a high school student i was terrified of giving class presentations i remember hyperventilating and rushing to the bathroom to puke before it was my turn then lo and behold i had a psychotic depressive episode and ive been terrified of crowded places since im mentioning that bc i think it all plays into each other the social anxiety depression and psychosis tldr social expectations of a high school student and a psychotic episode im one of those people that likes to read stories of people and their illnesses but also coping strategies etc do you know any books about social anxiety that have helped you one book i liked was called a life less anxiousby steve pavilanis having significant anxiety today but i think i know why ive had to take some valium to calm down and im still having a hard time anxiety is horrible id almost rather deal with depression then anxiety sending big hugs now rattled after making dinner i was doing so many things at once juggling things spikes my anxiety pretty bad plus i had to improvise a bit good thing i dont work in a restaurant daughters friend is still depressed she is getting burned out on him i told her she needs to take of herself first and if he does anything its not her fault going to watch a show or two and try to relax i have been dealing with anxiety today i took a warm bath and listened to music it helped some i found a list of coping skills and plan on trying a few ugh so sick of waking up with an anxiety attack it happens most mornings dreadful at least its s not a panic attack i guess just a large helping of heart pounding and body sweating  mind running anxiety expecting another call from my bank tomorrow i havent been able to fully pay on my credit card so im pretty sure thats what the call is about they called once friday but i missed it really anxious to have to deal with this hopefully i get a decent person on the phone so i can try to work something out instead of lying out of fear trying to keep calm i took more meds than i needed to this morning so spent most of the day groggy and lethargic ended up missing church couldnt focus on my tasks on the computer i hate doing that not being able to remember much very well just waiting until it gets out of my system anxiety has taken complete control of me already this morning im dying everything is crashing down on me and i just cant make it i feel like im bordering on a major fight with my boyfriend which may be relationship ending i should post separately about this so i dont hijack this thread please help didnt take the extra med today had therapy this morning talked about anxiety with going to school this next term honestly i already took the one class i wanted to take but i want to finish with a nokidding degree looked through my textbooks and they seem pretty straightforward will know more for sure next week when classes start see nurse tomorrow show her my lab work so hopefully she will leave me with latuda and not put me on something that will make things worse physically without the extra vistaril im not as calm but taking it now gives me a heavy dry mouth and lethargy hopefully with the pain management appointment on the 25th i wont need to be taking it anymore i plan a day at home to catch up on paperwork from being so far behind all summer and people call off i feel like i cant take a day off or everything goes to pot i know i need to have faith that other staff can handle it but right now i feel anxious and nauseous over today i found a post about the anxiety coach im looking at that site hi i am new to the forum i have increasingly felt like i want to stop talking as a bit of background i was the sensitive child  apparently in a family of very assertive and talkative people i can say now that they are quite domineering though i am an adult they still enjoy and feel entitled to offer their opinion about everything including my life choices even though i have children of my own now as a child i had a stammer which was quite severe at certain times and in certain situations i had speech therapy but it didnt resolve the problem i think i was reacting maybe to my childhood family situation which was difficult thankfully i always had good friends i also achieved ok academically and i worked in jobs which i enjoyed and which involved helping and working closely with vulnerable people i think my empathy kind of made up for my shyness and helped break barriers and i built good relationships with people it was like i hadnt had a voice in my family but at work i was valued i had a particularly nasty romantic relationship and when i went abroad to escape it i fell hook line and sinker for a charmer who became my husband he was abusive in every way but like many abusers abused me so cleverly that i didnt realise i was being abused until many years into the marriage i see now that he ride to keep me lacking in confidence sabotaging my development he was a loud person and had a booming voice loved to be centre of attention he wouldnt discuss things if we had any difference in views he would punish me if i tried to he used to tell me that he wishes i was nonverbal in my marriage my stammer returned to the severity that it had been when i was a child long story short i divorced him after becoming so unwell with his treatment of me i was so relieved to be able to tell people what i had been though i talked and talked it was like releasing everything i was free to talk no more secrecy i was diagnosed with ptsd and have been fighting that but something that has developed is my hatred of talking its not about stammering  my stammer is virtually gone now that he has its about a whole hatred of talking of talking myself or hearing other voices i wish i could go and live on a silent community where i never had to talk ever again or listen to other voices the feeling is getting stronger i dont know if social anxiety lies at the root of this i dont see myself as shy nowadays but maybe the ptsd is a cause also my ex tuned out to be such a liar telling dreadful lies about me in court and i have realised how he may be chatty and outgoing but every word he says is manipulative he uses people so now i feel repelled by loud people people who are witty and talkative  i had being around them and listening they just remind me of my ex trigger me and seem fake to me i am really worried that i will end up a total recluse i have two children and put on such a fake act in front of them sheltering them from the truth of my current issues hello miss sensitive thanks for sharing your concerns im afraid i cant really be of much help with it i also talk as little as possible  prefer to avoid conversation much to my wifes consternation and in addition im pretty reclusive as well however since im an older person its not a problem for me its just the way i am i see this is your first post here on pc so to psychcentral from the skeezyks may the time you spend here be of benefit psychcentral is a great place to get information as well as support

find a class that is one hour once a week im just going to take my clonazepam well im definitely not depressed my daughter moved the rest of her stuff yesterday to her dorm her room is so empty ive been having horrible panic and anxiety attacks and wonder how im going to pull this off im keeping busy but i just feel sick i think this is particularly hard because were so close and because shes the only one who has seen the good bad and ugly of my illness and has always gotten it shes always been of the mindset that her mom is ill and sometimes we do things a bit differently and that is ok we have been each others support which some may disagree with but it worked for us whenever either of us was having a tough time just holding hands and saying everything will be fine would calm us right down she was going to stay and go to college here but i knew she needed to fly so i helped her with the bigger college 2 hours away that was the most loving thing i could do for her thanks for letting me rattle on i feel better now or that could be the valium sending big hugs got through pnurse appt today she has nervous and so was i at least i dont have to change meds for another three months so thats good she was also okay with me going off vistaril because of the muscle relaxer hopefully ill be off the latter soon because it slows me down too much other than that and getting some extra groceries it was a peaceful day i did pretty good today got my car steam cleaned inside and out went to 3 bible studies floated in the pool had lunch and dinner with friends and after having done my daily calm meditation im going to watch rhony i think i might survive after all busy day tomorrow planned as well hugs to everyone its been weird today since i didnt have a good dream and went to a new store it was hot outside and i felt irritated but yesterday i was okay and went to class i think its my hormones i love how anxiety makes me feel stupid sarcasm i got a call about a job i applied for today but im absolutely terrified to call them back tomorrow the job is halfway across the country but where we really want to move to its just figuring out the logistics now that has me petrified i dont know how we afford to get out there for an interview much less afford a place to live and moving fees if i get the job i didnt think id be so scared to finally make this move been another quiet day daughter is home so i didnt much done anxiety is still there i just keep distracting myself for a while saw my counselor today and it was a rough session i wish my brain had an off switch did okay today now prepared for school next week good thing because im going to be busy starting tomorrow doing laundry and housework and making potato salad for church picnic on sunday anxiety is around the corner but i hope it doesnt jump me your refusal to lower yourself to another persons level in the middle of unnecessary conflict does not make you look weak it makes you look like the more mature wiser stronger person if you chose to respond in a like manner the conflict could escalate to something unmanageable theres nothing wrong with walking away i admire that best wishes well i will start off by saying i am a 38 year old female who lives by myself along with 2 dogs and 1 cat i have been living alone for 5 years now and have found my anxiety getting worse each year i used to be a very outgoing friendly happy person and now i am so insecure filled with worry and guilt and am so nervous to be around people because of what they may think of me and my life i literally have 1 girlfriend and i have known her for 24 years unfortunately over the years i have distanced myself from her because i feel i cant relate to her anymore she is married and has children i am divorced with no children i think in a way i distanced myself because i am jealous of her life ive always wanted a family and a home i currently have a boyfriend of 2 years now however the situation isnt really ideal for anyone he is currently married but they live in same house different rooms they are coparenting for the children while i love him to death i dont know if i am with him because i love him because i am lonely because i really want to be with someone because i like to punish myself or because i am just that messed up and think its what i deserve i have really had some abusive relationships in my life its seems to be what i attract he is not abusive at all he treats me very well but i want him to move out and finalize a divorce and we argue about it often this relationship goes along with this anxiety because truthfully i am a secret no one gets to know me in his family i currently work in a very customer service job i am a pit boss at a casino this job forces me to talk to people sometimes have uncomfortable conversations with them i supervise people and i am very outgoing however everyone thinks i am always angry because of the look on my face i dont smile when i am not talking to people aka resting bi face the truth is i am just nervous i dont want people to judge me im over weight and do not like how i look or feel about myself and i feel everyone else thinks just like i do the funny thing is once my shift gets going i forget all about the anxiety i dont know if its the business that takes the thoughts away from it or what but when the night slows down it all comes rushing back i find myself sitting alone in our employee dining room even though there are 50 people in there at most times i feel like i dont know how to converse with people and sometimes i feel like  are these people really that stupid thinking like that is really bad i dont feel i am smarter than people but i feel like i have way more common sense than some and unfortunately i feel like i talk to people like they are stupid and that is not my intention at all i try to talk so they come up with the right answer on their own while being guided and realizing just how little effort it takes to think a few more minutes and come up with the answer on their own but it comes out all wrong the anxiety then takes over my whole being and i just want to run far away sometimes i feel like im not myself when im at work like i get to be someone else the guests there dont know my personal life they dont know what ive been through so they just get to see happy me this anxiety isnt just work and friend related it is at its worst when attending family functions i really do not associate with family i cant breathe when i am around them i have been in my apartment for 5 years and i have never had them over i have 2 sisters and a father that live 1520 min from me and they have never seen my place i dont know what it is that freaks me out or triggers it i just wish it would go away and i could have my life back its pretty lonely being 38 and having no friends any suggestions well im an older person not twice your age yet but im gettin there im married but otherwise i lead a thoroughly solitary lifestyle by choice there is no extended family  i have no friends or acquaintances i only leave the house when necessary it works for me however even though i live the reclusive lifestyle i live voluntarily i find that the more i am alone the more i prefer to just be alone the more alone the better and the less comfortable it is for me to be outabout being alone  feeling awkward in social situations breeds on itself i believe yes when youre at work  busy it makes sense to me that your social anxiety would fade into the background but then as soon as youre off work or not busy doing what you do it comes rushing back from my perspective i think the remedy for this is simply to get out there  find ways to be more social volunteer pursue some personal interests that put you in touch with other people that sort of thing i dont know what kinds of things are of interest to you so its difficult to be specific but the more you get out there the easier it will become perhaps still not easy but easier however if you feel this is something you simply cant do on your own then the alternatives are mental health therapy   or psych meds unfortunately there arent any magic solutions to this that i know of perhaps other members will have other suggestions to offer i wish you well church picnic went well over half of the potato salad was eaten so that was good i was nervous with my husband being out in the heat but he took it very well on the other hand i started to become a hot sweaty mess so we left early school starts tomorrow i hope that whatever i have for homework will be done before thursday my husband is taking me out that day for a spa treatment friday is when i get another injection for my backi may be knocked out for it saturday is my birthday been really anxious but i think ill still do okay hope school goes well fharriage this is the first time its back to school and im not going as i finished it feels kind of weird anxiety was mostly okay most of the day minus a very short panic attack its almost time for bed i have to take the dog out but its really dark so i get kind of scared im kind of nervous to sleep too i know it sounds juvenile but im kind of worried bad people are in my closet i havent felt this way in years until recently i saw something creepy on tv not too long ago i think this triggered it i hope it goes away soon im sort of nervous because my college class starts on tuesday but its only one hour a relative is going to take me so i hope it goes well im feeling monday work anxiety i feel extra anxious almost every monday but it doesnt make it any easier so anxious about my literature class the whole thing is based on the final project which is an anthology of works that we like and why we like them lots of words and it starts with the introductory assignment ugh nothing like feeling under pressure already at least my office app class started slow the saving grace is that it isnt due until sunday why do i do this to myself so anxious about money today it helps being woke by a call from someone who you owe money to sarcasm i really want to do credit counseling to figure this all out but the only place around is associated with the company i work for so im feeling too freaked out to try to make an appointment i dont know what to do finished the literature assignment but not very well going to read ahead and see if i can do better still have to plan meals for the next few days and get groceries i just want to get to thursday so i can relax and enjoy things i am on clozapine at night and it depresses me but also makes me sleep through the night that is why i take it at bedtime i need it for my schitzophrenia which makes nervous alot but for some reason today i feel pretty good im just wondering who here is taking meds for their anxiety and who is getting therapy and which you think works better ive been having a lot of anxiety with starting a new job lately and my pdoc offered me an ssri i told her id get therapy instead but its been 2 months and i still havent called for an appointment if meds which meds and if therapy do you know the type thanks for your help im on meds for depression welbutrin paxil lamictal and none seem to help with anxiety even though paxil is supposed to also been in therapy cognitive approach for a couple months and that is helping a bit but its really difficult to change thinking patterns ive had for 20 years im holding out hope that therapy will work pdoc hasnt offered anything for anxiety but i think its going to take some time dont lose sight of the fact that new jobsactivities cause everyone anxiety to a certain extent but will probably lessen over time as you get to know the routines and have a bit more confidence in your ability to do the job i use to get horrible stiff necks for the first couple weeks of a new job try that doing a new job in really bad pain  but i look down the road to six weeks or months and just concentrate on doing the best i can until then im on a low dose of cipralex it helps but doesnt eliminate all of my anxiety i can function a lot better and do things i couldnt before such as eating out i recently asked my psychiatrist for some psychotherapy that specifically addresses my anxiety since i have noticed my thinking patterns tend to nourish it the medication hasnt eased this problem it has helped ease the obsessive nature of anxiety though we are going to discuss this at my next appointment i have a feeling therapy and medication will probably help me a lot more than just one or the other so yesterday i went to my college class and i was nervous during class i dont know if it was the heat or looking for the right building that i was tired i wish i could have done better im coming down off a pretty  high several hour long panic whew she is safe my daughter is safe that is what is important i was on the phone with my daughter when her fire alarm went off while talking to me there was a knock at her door telling her to get out of the building smoke was billowing from the top floor so as you can imagine my heart was in my throat the latest update is that it is all out she suspects it was a dryer fire she is waiting for permission to go back inside she is pretty sure her condo is okay its opposite side of the building on the ground floor but who cares about a bit of damage she is okay hi there i am ok but still have burning sensation in my shoulders and behind my neck what was a great day at the spa turned into yet even more pain when i dropped something in the car and tried to reach it my left shoulder is strained now tomorrow i have undergo another nerve block in my back nervous and not feeling good now i cant stop feeling that everyone hates me i know its not true but the thought wont go away one person is mad at me at work and now i dread going back because im afraid everyone will take his side and hate me and it will be miserable and now i cant sleep and i didnt know where to turn and i have no one to talk to so i came here if you dont have a therapist i recommend getting onesometimes having someone in authority tell you that other people dont hate you stops this in its tracks yesterday i found out that the nerve block they put in my back was a trial run i had no pain for about 30 minutes then it hurt like hell until i took the muscle relaxer today was my birthday and im feeling better we went out of town for the day i got a new purse a crystal necklace and a set of headphones we also ate a ton of food looks like ill be cooking the rest of this month and next month but it was good i withdrew from my literature class im too stressed out to handle two hard classes ill take it again another term i want this to be accomplished but not losing my sanity doing it slow and easy anxiety will go down once the withdrawal is processed hope i can handle that havent posted on here in awhile when my doctor put me on abilify for my depression it drastically decreased the anxiety as well thank the good lord i hope it continues was busy cleaning house yesterday while the kids were gone we got quite a bit done but we were worn out today was t and labs for the regular doc appt next week t went okay i talked a bit about the anxiety from the two classes so that helped finished my homework for the week a 70 question pretest to be done in 70 minutes needless to say i didnt finish and i didnt do well still i remembered a lot so that was good tomorrow is dermatology my face is back to where it once was which is itchy and red ill see what she does this time anxiety is doing better now but i wish i wasnt so bad with the extra class it has been a good day im having rooms remodeled my daughter is back in school i am writing again no complaints saw dermatologist today she has no more options for me so shes referring me to her boss she also gave me two more ointments and a strong antibiotic im not sure about the latter as it has some nasty side effects otherwise a quiet day anxiety is down a little but depression is starting to creep in had a panic attack at my endocrinologists office today i was shaking and they wanted to weigh me while i was shaking so i asked them to wait a minute and then the shaking stopped and i got weighed went to the appointment the appointment was fine mentioned i had lightheartedness which i thought was from low blood sugar but the doctor seems to think instead its low blood pressure from the inderal i take for anxiety ugh i cant catch a break we went to a pair this morning and took photos ive been using the corticosteroid cream even for a tiny amount twice a day ive been really irritable however my skin is doing better didnt have much else going on until next week i may have to redo my laptop since its now acting weird anxiety is high because of the irritability not posted for a while im 28 weeks pregnant today the reality that this baby has gotta come out is hitting hard anxiety coming and going about all sorts nervous about upcoming obstetrician appointment i get pain when examined so keep crying about it went mad on cleaning and tidying house today nesting instinct money worries and hubby gotta get a new job stepdaughter starting new school hope shes ok gotta finish my masters degree dissertation before baby arrives im soooo tired and stressed im having some pretty intense anxiety today dealing with a few triggers have a ton to do but i feel completely unable to do them at the moment that in itself is making me even more anxious too i havent really posted in the anxiety forums since i signed up ive been dealing more with depression in the last few months but my catastrophic thinking is back in full force today ive written to check in with a few friends and ended up deleting my message because i realized my tone sounded like i was telling them goodbye i have that mydaysarenumbered kind of certainty stillive been here a million times before and i logically know i just need to wait it out and it will pass and my brain will flip back to the lesser of my two evils depression fun times anxiety is even worse now since a relative messaged me the relative wants to know what ive done to make no one at the nursing home say happy birthday same as my mother who asked what i did to the bullies at school to make them pick on me right now i hate them i hate them both i have been coming a long way from what i used to be i have battled anxiety pretty much all my life until a few years ago when i did spiritual forgiveness and forgave some people and connected with god a lot better i also finally have the right prescription glasses and not afraid of the dark anymore either my anxiety has pretty much gone down the drain for a good reason great for you stress anxiety and depression have landed me in the hospital in days past and i still deal with depression but dealing with things causing the anxiety has helped a bit even with that good for you i hope i can get there too i have struggled with anxiety and depression off and on all my life the recent episode the most severe now i really need to make some lifestyle changes and do the work i should be doing so it never gets this bad again i was sort of anxious this afternoon i realized i took my geodon late geodon is not for anxiety but when i realized i didnt take it i started worrying about that i feel okay now that ive taken it my anxiety has been under control today thankfully i have this weird nervousness though like i just want to talk someones ear off about nothing really im a pretty quiet private person but i get these jittery moods where i get chatty overly verbose and feel like im going to explode if i dont call or email someone and talk their ear off my mom for all her faults is good at absorbing my wordy outbursts when i call her i need to remember that and be grateful quotealpacalicious5409010when i think about my therapist i feel anxious i miss her i didnt see her this week maybe thats why also since this is a therapy service offered by my university when ill finish uni and that is soon on february ill have to stop seeing her i think so this hurt me a bit because i think ill miss her even more i wish i could stay more plus i feel the same problems are with me everyday i need therapyquote im actually afraid to start therapy because i would view the therapist like a best friend and would miss that person well husband has an allergy to two types of dust mites this means more cleaning that ill have to do im getting shots for my right rotator cuff in a couple of weeks hopefully ill be out of pain i have arthritis in my shoulder so well see diabetes stuff has been renewed need to make a regular doc appt in december before she goes on maternity leave also have to make appt for mammogram which i forgot to do this summer things are going somewhat okay i worry about daughters boyfriends parents who are vacationing in fl hope they get out before the hurricane arrives they already had enough drama due to the older brother mood is still kind of down this type of anxiety is manageable i have a mountain of commitments and errands today much more than normal and it makes me feel unable to take enjoyment in little things but i can handle this level of stress its not a deal breaker i may not enjoy today but i wont necessarily hate it either i can work with this at least only had to plan meals and get some groceries for those meals otherwise ive been resting i also have the tires ordered sent a message to get a quote from the electrician and put a voicemail in for the mammogram have to get meds tomorrow that may take awhile anxiety is down but my mood is also down hope it perks up in a while i was taking caffeine pills for energy and my therapist asked me to stop made a big difference in my anxiety no heart palpitations or stomach churning between that and the new medication for depression im on my anxiety and panic is in check hallelujah i have a harder time with anxiety then depression hope this continues so this past month ive had three incidents that would normally cause me a huge amount of anxiety some of which would have normally left me anxious for hours or a day or two but i didnt i just dealt with it the best way i could at the time and that was that looking back im proud of how i was able to keep cool the other day i decided to sever contact with two acquaintances on facebook and this caused me the biggest burst of anxiety that ive felt in the past month or so but while it was significant it only lasted five minutes and i was able to keep my cool there too i know that im not going to be completely free of anxiety its a normal part of me and always will be ill no doubt have some anxiety in the future but so far it seems like ive learned how to get control of it and keep it in check im really happy for you being able to control your anxiety is such an awesome feeling especially for me its been really difficult last week for me where i would just consistently feel anxious and let that dictate my actions and my lifestyle i nearly ruined my relationship with two people i really care and love this week has been much better and i have been able to work through my negative thoughts and emotions and in the long run control my anxiety it feels very accomplishing its hard to keep up sometimes because i feel like i am going to ruin it but i just keep going and improving its a practice and lifestyle and im glad that people are working through it slowly but surely did a load of laundry appointments for electrician and mammogram are set renewed my latuda prescription so i can order it next week i have been so grumpy this week yesterday was really bad i chewed out an old lady that i thought was cutting in front of me im normally not that combative still worried about my daughters boyfriends parents who were vacationing in florida mowers and trimmers are outside my home office the noise has me clenching my teeth like swarms of mechanical wasps so yeah my anxiety is up along with being irritable i had a short panic attack today otherwise anxiety was okay lots of crazy thoughts in my head today though 88butterfly88 sorry to hear about your panic attack ive had some anxiety today kind of the feeling where id like to curl up in a locked up room in a bean bag and pillows and feel safe but dont feel like i could feel safe ive come a huge way from how bad my anxiety used to be but it is still unpleasant im having anxiety about eating certain things in recovery from an ed and about being alone vs being with my family who are not the healthiest people to be around for extended periods of time finished homework for next week it was like i was in a fog and when i came out i felt jittery made a hefty meal for dinner and now im starting to calm down i have church tomorrow and t on monday i may talk to t and see what i can do to get rid of this irritability cant sleep worrying about dissertation want to get it done before babys here worried i wont cope with everything including looking after step daughter im low in iron and so tired and achy a bit anxious due to the hurricane because it is raining and probably the power would go out i was able to finish my homework for both classes i can spend days feeling certain that the worst case scenarios will come true then mercifully it just stops suddenly the future isnt as scary it feels like a physical switch being thrown almost instantaneous i dont get it asmr videos get me so drowsy sometimes i fall asleep when i listen to one i like to listen to music play my favourite game have a nap on agoraphobia i found it online and the lady who runs it lyn seems reasonable she does 3 weeks of what she calls talking about it why am i agoraphobic why am i anxious what are my thoughts when these ssituations happen to me and then 3 weeks of exposure to the anxiety im really hoping it helps me at least a little im doing this for myself so i hope the 45 i payed for it was worth it i start on the 22nd september we are going to do some muscle relaxing stuff shattered thats wonderful i suffer from agoraphobia too would you mind pming me the link i really struggle and meds and therapy havent been effective its been years since i went out regularly i live five minutes from the mall last time there was over four years ago i get to pdoc and t appts and thats about it my bf picks up my meds grocery shops etc i cant even go to my bipolar support group meetings anymoreand i used to be a facilitator i want my life back im super excited for you todays meant to be the day i have my first session really dont want to do it not because im anxious im just drained need too though for my own good so the first session was just talking about anxiety what causes it and what i do to help with it we identified what my goal would be go to mcdonalds and she also told me about this cd she wants me to order that will teach me about the difference between relaxation and tention continues next week mostly good though she did cut it short i payed for a 60 minit session and only got 30 bjornen  i get that too at times ill feel dread of some impending disaster and sometimes my mood will flip and everything will feel full of peace and almost euphoria its kind of frustrating sending thoughts to everyone in hurricane danger areas x im still getting anxiety around eating today i need to remind myself that where food my body and exercise is concerned my brain just doesnt function i need to go by the rules or guidance of other people like my dietician and not follow my ed thoughts im starting dogwalking this week for two different people and feel kind of anxious about that doing new things makes me extremely anxious even if its something i am sure i will enjoy just the fact that it is new or in a new environment makes it feel like going to a dentist to have teeth extracted ended up in urgent care for pain in my right eye doc didnt know if it was pinkeye or a stye she gave me antibiotic cream regardless it isnt helping me much so i may have to go to an eye doctor tomorrow i missed church again but i felt this was more important husband is stuck with more homework than planned so its been a quiet day anxiety is up but manageable at the moment hope your eye feels better fharraige my anxiety is still really up at the moment a lot of it related to people and relationshipsinteractions i think at times im feeling paralysed by anxiety and just want to crawl out of my skin im in recovery from a variety of addictionsprocess addictions and the only relationship i really feel good in is my one with my sponsor but i really start feeling bad when i just talk to him constantly and offload all my feelings on one person anxiety is steadily increasing there is nothing in my life that i dont feel nervous about theres nothing i can think of to help it my anxiety has been extremely high today to the point of feeling like i cant leave the house i made myself get out anyway which was good but i dont know whats happened that its shot up recently had a job interview today that sent my anxiety skyhigh i dont know what it is about interviewing with this place i just feel like a mess during them at least its over now i should be able to relax today i had an interesting feeling for the first time i felt in control of my anxiety i could hear the worry thoughts but i didnt want to run from them like i used to i could hear my negative thoughts in my mind but i was able to coexist with them and not let them push me around its almost like i was standing up to a bully it felt great and i hope i can keep this up sometimes its the little things in life hello i am new here i have been reading threads online about anxiety for a while and decided to join because they seemed so useful i am happy for you worrist and happy to possibly meet all of you guys so happy for you keep up the positive thinking i am new here and so its nice to meet everyone i hope to benefit from these forums and hopefully benefit someone else as well yay thats amazing its really hard to practice controlling anxiety after letting it control you for so long ive built it up to a lifestyle where i do things i enjoy and things i know will help me calm down in order to keep my anxiety in check its a struggle and sometimes i do lose to it but i dont stop keep going im going to cook for friends tonight nothing fancy i hate using the excuse that i will do something when i get better why not now so what if i feel tense and anxious i like making food and i shouldnt wait around for some mythical perfect day to do it edit it turned out alright weirdly i still had the tension from a random anxiety today but it didnt affect my mood tonight like it normally would my body just feels like it ran a marathon is all i gave notice i am moving effective 31 oct  yet i dont have new place yet i am really quite anxious about this im back at least for a bit temporary back injections worked out okay but i have a bad backache for a day or two after they wear off i will be seeing the pain management doc tomorrow to see if i get the longlasting ones i hope so because i like to do more around the house my mind is creating worsecase scenarios as usual so im still rather anxious about the whole thing school is going okay not sure if i want to continue taking classes as they stress me out more than anything now husband is doing better now that we had the carpets cleaned it will be time though to vacuum everything and im not looking forward to that so right now im nervous but i seem to manage it okay im feeling really anxious about work tomorrow im really not invested in this job anymore i just dont want to bother going i do best when i can convince myself that there is nothing to gain by obsessing on the future the nagging voice inside is trying to convince me that im being irresponsible by not thinking about the future enough but my appointments are made and my calendar is marked for any important events so theres literally no reason to think anymore about the future anything else is just rumination im doing an okay job at not giving in to that voice this morning i hope you all are managing okay too since losing my dad on april 20th i havent been back to my job well i tried one morning around two weeks ago but i had severe panic attacks couldnt focus on my work kept crying had endless intrusive thoughts etc so i only worked 3 hours today was my first actual day back since it happened and i felt pretty okay not 100 of course but much better than the first time i tried to go back today was a pretty nice day all in all just thought i would share still have back pain but its dull the longterm injection for the left side is oct 5 still having the catastrophic thinking but plan out positive outcomes seems to help ran errands and doing laundry now would study but i need a few hours uninterrupted and it didnt happen today hopefully tomorrow afternoon will be better after all the hospital appointments in the morning still hanging in there though thankfully my anxiety is feeling great today which i think is a good thing music always seems to help me relax and put my mind at ease anytime im stressed out or have too much on my mind getting a little stressed and anxious about things i know i need to do but keep putting off i can be a procrastinator hugs to everyone grouphug i took a lot of xanax and some inderal today because i was agitated i wasnt as nervous as usual probably because of the meds i wish i could get by with less meds today my anxiety has not been too bad its 853pm and i usually get really bad anxiety at night i had plenty of rest today my anxiety is building again it doesnt help that possible trigger my period started last night function rejtgomb tag

thisinnertext   gombvalue  show    so my moods are all over the place im starting to worry about a job interview i have on friday i really hope that it goes well i still really need a fulltime job and ive been seeing fewer and fewer fulltime positions being posted online i know a new job is going to take care of so much stress i just have to get one my stress is bleeding over to my boyfriend now and hes starting to have little depressive episodes too i dont know how much more of this i can take i really want it to start getting better soon dreading tomorrow too many people i dont want to meet with too many appointments i dont want to keep from morning all the way into the evening too much tired of pretending for them dreaming of running away forever but no i really want to cancel tomorrow i mean on 1 hand 45 is a lot of money to waste and if i dont aqctually do the first session whats the point but then my emotions have been all over the place this week and ive felt drained on a number f occasions im sure lynn would understand i usually get anxious when im idle so the only thing that really helps me with anxiety is distracting myself with information watching videos listening to music or reading up on something nonstop is what i usually do to cope i like theatre and was always curious about the actual process involved in making a play and performing it but my social anxiety always prevented me from trying to get involved in amateur stuff well last summer i had the luckiest moment in my entire life and ended up not only meeting my favorite actor but actually spending some time at his home with his wife who is an amazing person involved in theatre herself anyway meeting those people seeing first hand how this favorite actor of mine is this rather introverted person who is quite uncomfortable being in the center of any attention and so on managed to give me a push and enough courage to take some amateur acting classes yesterday my class had the first performance of a play on an actual theatre stage with an audience i was so nervous and i did take half a xanax but i managed to go out there and say my lines and actually do ok i was afraid i would not be able to go on stage or that i would go and forget everything but it went well and that was one of the few victories i have had against my social anxiety actually i would recommend amateur acting classes to everyone they can help with social anxiety and with how you present yourself to others with trusting and being more vulnerable in front of other people plus if you do a play that requires camaraderie and trust so you may end up making friends wow to me this is much more than a small success i could never do that thats great i also recommend acting classes for anyone i love love love acting just got a call back from my drs office they want blood tests before my next appointment its usually easier for me to go the week before so that means tomorrow plus i have another blood test ive been putting off because of insurance for another dr that i should do that should be about 45 vials of blood altogether i have a severe phobia of needles usually i can get through it if they dont have to take much blood and can go through the back of my hand but with this much theyre going to insist on going through my arm and that always gives me a panic attack im already so anxious to go tomorrow im going to have to take an extra prn before i go otherwise im going to have a panic attack in the lab i just know it im going to take a few days break from pc hugs to all today is meant to be the first day of my course the 6 week one i posted about i really dont want to do it really dont so the first session was just talking about anxiety what causes it and what i do to help with it we identified what my goal would be go to mcdonalds and she also told me about this cd she wants me to order that will teach me about the difference between relaxation and tention continues next week mostly good though she did cut it short i payed for a 60 minit session and only got 30 for the last two days i had no anxiety but today i did and it was getting bad i took a 05 ativan and had my youngest daughter sing some of her favorite songs to me she danced for me too we watched a few youtube videos and had a good laugh my anxiety went away today i knew my day would be busy i took a ativan before i left the house then hours and hours later i was ready to try and relax i could feel the anxiety sneaking in i took another ativan to help me settle down i played some music for a while i wasnt overly anxious today for a change last night i was a wreck though i had so much nervous energy i only got 5 hours sleep i tried to take xanax to help me sleep but it isnt making me as tired lately which is good for when i take it in the day but im hoping this doesnt mean it will stop working for my anxiety one of the things that has held me back professionally has been taking risks ive been scared to take risks for as long as i can remember i remember thinking what if this happens or what if that happens you know the routine late last year a guy from work left and i was asked if i wanted to take his duties over while we searched his replacement in the past every time ive been in this situation i would have said no this time i decided that things would be different i said yes i was scared and terrified but all my team members were very compassionate i learned so many things i improved my process that now im up for a promotion this was the first time that i really felt that i was beating my anxiety ive noticed myself starting to take more risks others may not see them as being big risks but for me they are huge and it feels fantastic go you thats how im handling the same issues at work asking for and taking on added responsibilities scary some days but moving me in the right direction thanks for sharing i needed to hear that anxiety is not fear exactly because fear is focused on something right in front of you a real and objective danger it is instead a kind of fear gone wild a generalized sense of dread about something out there that seems menacing but that in truth is not menacing and may not even be out there if youre anxious you find it difficult to talk yourself out of this foreboding you become trapped in an endless loop of whatifs i was flesh bereft of spirit wrote the journalist patricia pearson in a brief history of anxiety yours and mine in a pitchperfect description of this emotional morass a friable self grotesque i got an aids test i had my moles checked i grew suspicious of pains in my back if i was nauseous i worried about cancer and started reading up obsessively on symptoms i lay in bed whenever i could trying to shut up the clamor of terror with sleep  robin marantz henig understanding the anxious mind i realized today that the last time i sat down to watch a tv show or film either at home or in a theater was november ive gone almost a whole year without allowing myself to escape for a little while something about getting involved in stories sets the worry wheels in motion for me i dont understand why its like getting lost in fiction makes me feel out of control of myself and starts a cascade of catastrophic thoughts i dont really miss any of it its just weird screw this i wish i could go back into toddler and kids when i still dumb and too ignorant to care with any problems tomorrow my mental health worker is coming well so she says shes very angry with me because i put in a complaint about her that she wasnt doing her job well she isnt i just hope she wont slap me thats my biggist fear about tomorrow that she will she wouldnt be allowed too but well i lived with abuse all my life so you can understand why i think that way i saw pdoc yesterday shes downing my antipsychotic and im a bit worried it wont go well but im trying to be hopeful im anxious about being put under tomorrow for a procedure ive been put under plenty of times but this one is bothering me for some reason im anxious again because the last paycheck did not go to well so i anxious if boss would be late again next i was expected to earn raise this time since i have been a permanent work but they postpone to talk about it with busy excuse through it is true that they are busy im not sure anymore hi all its a long story but ill say that though i took my driving license as soon as i was allowed to i have always been terrified of driving for several years i could just drive for very short times and on well known roads with someone sitting near me then i totally stopped at the end i even had anxiety when i tried to just sit on the driving seat well at a certain point for various reasons i began wanting to can drive though i was still terified i went back to driving school because after years without driving i really needed it then i began driving again with my parents and then aloneon the first time i drove for a very very short time and on a very easy road out of town and i had anxiety however it was around a year ago i still anxiety for many other times actually but then it became a bit less and i began feeling safe driving for longer times and also in town i took many little steps well now i can drive alone every day to the place where im having a sort of working experience out of my town and sometimes i went also to other places in the area even without practicing before just knowing some points in the area im not terrified at the idea not to can handle some unexpected situations i can do it last year i would have never ever imagined to can do so when i read about people who overcame driving anxiety i used to think i could never do itinstead maybe at the moment i would have a very very long drive like for going on holidaymaybe in future ill can maybe its a bit too much i dont know yetbut compared to last year this is a very big success so what i mean is overcoming driving anxiety is possible you can do it too you can feel free to message me also privately if you want to talk about driving anxiety im happy to help if i can my suggestion is little steps hugs to all sorry if there are any english mistakes congratulations i have a bit of driving anxiety as well hence why i am 20 and have yet to get my license aha thank you for sharing i woke up didnt even have a chance to get out of bed and had a panic attack just laying there i got up and took my thyroid medication as usual and then unfortunately had to wait 30 minutes before i could take any other med i ended feeling better i just hate waking up that way i wondered if i had a nightmare but i dont recall one im not doing well been overwhelmed by other class so i withdrew now i dont have anything to do and feel frustrated by my anxiety i dont feel good about going out and about either my husband also has anxiety with class and i have to remind him that this is supposed to be for personal benefit but he puts too high of an expectation on himself maybe i do too i dont know my right shoulder is sore and my lower back hurts i think i may just have tendonitis in the shoulder since i have that before i have lidocaine patches but they take 23 weeks to help plus i forget to put them on mri is the middle of next month longterm treatment for the back is next week my brain has been running through catastrophic thinking for a while but i imagine good outcomes so it helps im just sad and upset right now im trying to do better but it seems the anxiety keeps winning out even with good meds and therapy im back to feeling useless and lazy i just dont know what to do now never did do the second part of my anxiety course probably not wise i spent a lot of money on that but the plus side is that the girl who instructs me didnt even call me to ask why i didnt bother with it i think deep down she knows from that first session it wasnt working and she knows she was wrong to rip me off yesterday i got handed eviction notice to leave my current property in 4 weeks i cant pay the price they are asking to keep me here so for the next few weeks i will be looking for somewhere close to where i currently am to make the move as stressfree as possible i have driving riding in a car anxiety i am seeing a new cbt therapist progress i have made will get in the car and ride around town with some fear we live in a big city i dont like riding on the freeway ill drive around a radius of about five miles i wont drive at night i wont drive on the freeway today i drove to lunch and the grocery and back i also drove to my bipolar group and back with my husband in the car tomorrow i need to drive to yoga by myself ill keep hopping in this thread to post progress drove this morning to take the car down for a repair will likely have to go pick it up one goal i have this week is to drive around a tiny bit at night maybe just in the neighborhood and the out on the big streets a little went to yoga again today drove back and forth alone i want to drive some at night just sort of around the neighborhood but by the time it gets dark i am really tired i can relate to you i am 74 use to teach driving now when i am a passenger i have to sit in the back seat even that is no good i get vertigo and when i drive myself like you i do not do tunpikes nor do i drive at night im incredibly scared of driving and havent done so in 15 years that is within some months of obtaining my drivers license it is due to a nearaccident of which i cant remember a single thing not even that it happened but my parents were in the car with me and they agree on its happening ive given up by now i have too many other issues to address and this one is not bothering me too much at the moment of course it would be different if i had to go to work but luckily i work frome home im afraid of driving too and ashamed of it  i feel like i am not a real grownup even at 53 years old i do have a license and can drive if i absolutely have to but that is rare as long as it isnt dark raining and i dont have to take a highway or go anywhere unfamiliar i avoid if at all possible  it terrifies me oh dont worry i know  the stress is palpable and that makes things worse its a negative cycle today i feel the same and struggling with myselfi am really trying to keep bringing my mind back to the moment instead of letting it wander out to problems everybody here sounds just like me i have been fighting anxiety and depression for the past 5 years and still not sure if its all in my head or is a real physical condition in my brain everyone i know including my family say that its all in the way i think i grew up in a country where i was never expected to drive because we have lots of population and public transportation options but when i moved to usa i always tried to live 23 miles from work and took uber to work everyday but now i married the man of my dreams and its not totally up to me to pick where i live we cant keep buying houses close to work every time i change a job i must drive though it causes me lots of anxiety started taking klonopin for my anxiety attacks and fetzima 80mg for depression am driving on 30mph speed limit roads to work with my husband sitting by my side hope to be able to drive ti work by myself someday welcome to pc nimazen this thread is perfect for me i have a sort of driving phobia have had my licences for 6 years but till few months ago i practically didnt use it i was terrified but now im really improving i didnt think i could honestly my therapist is helping me what is working for me is to talk little little steps one at a time i began driving with someone and out of town but now i can drive for a short time alone out of town or with someone in town didnt try the two things together yet alone in town but step by step ill arrive to it dont give up you all i thought i couldnt do it but now im really doing it step by step and with some help we can learn how to drive my father is being faced with having his license revoked this has increased my own anxiety about driving as i now feel i am being monitored i dont think you are monitored how you drive doesnt reflect how your dad drives i dont mind driving but being a passenger causes me great anxiety i have to know exactly where we are going and when we are coming back if i dont drive and it has to be a distance i can walk or get a taxi back if needed i have made no progress if anything i am much worse about it if i rode to the store with someone and they veered on to a freeway to leave town i would have to take control of the vehicle if they wouldnt let me out or turn around i lost a job a few years ago due to the big boss of the company wanting me to accompany him as he drove randomly around the county looking at various properties thinking i could tough it out so he wouldnt know i said nothing till i blasted his truck interior with breakfast and got out when he stopped the truck and refused to get back in im sorry this puts so much stress on you and hope you feel better soon if this tells you anything it took me 20 minutes of procrastinating before i could type into this box hello ive gone through the same social issues i currently have no friends outside my family because i feel really afraid to make some and i am in college not getting the full college experience well community college anyway i just wish i wasnt so afraid i know i can be a good friend and all but just taking that step to actually speaking to someone is where i struggle it might be that im a little critical of myself and afraid that those i approach might not find me interesting enough to want to actually develop a friendship with me because i can be a little different at times a mindset i believe my mental issues have contributed to but yes that is my social anxiety story oh i also am really uncomfortable going out to public places the whole i think im the center of the world thing and everyone is judging me is what makes me feel really uneasy had to quit my job because of panic attacks and social anxiety had a traumatic experience due to workplace bullying i once was a very outgoing social person the awful experience changed me would like to volunteer but my fear of people prevents it ive lost trust in the human race im getting help and sisters are supportive i live alone with my pets my husband died 24 years ago have huge problems in crowds and around people i dont know even avoid my neighbors in neighborhood where i have lived almost 50 years wish i could be the person i once was glad i can express myself on this forum i was horribly socially anxious as a child even something small such as passing a paper back required vast mental preparation and the only reason i could do that was because there was no communication involved so bothered was i that i had difficulty turning in my papers i recall an instance in which a teacherwhom i seemed to particularly annoy for whatever reasonscolded me for taking too long on a worksheet youve had plenty of time why arent you finished i was finished i had been finished for quite some time i just couldnt turn in the paperto walk up to the teacher and say here you go was absolutely terrifying it wasnt until i got my first job at 17 that the anxiety got better out of necessity really i notice my anxiety manifest itself differently now instead of being terrified all of the time i have days where i can socialize and days where i cant function in public at all so the anxiety appears at half the time with twice as much potency hi all awesome that we have a new forum i have a dx of social anxiety along with gad and bipolar with psychotic featuresjust one more thing right maybe notwhen i was in jr high i really wouldnt speakpeople my age would say hello and i would just look at them but if a teacher called on me i would answer because id get into trouble if i didnt and that would be more talking id like to say i grew out of it but it was more like after a lot of work i improved i had a guidance counselor who pulled me out of class one day for you guessed it not talkingi thought it was so ironic most students get in trouble for talking in class anyway he told me i had two choices either to join some activities at the school or to continue to see him periodically i didnt want to talk so i joined two clubsi knew they were monitoring me thoughperhaps part of this was paranoia but really school officials have a lot of power and can certainly check up on you so i started very slowly talking to people and after a lot of sweating and anxiety i had a few friends the school left me alone after this but still i never dated until my late 30s so i wasnt totally normal i got cbt for my psychosis but a lot of it dealt with anxiety because it was hand tailored to me so i started dating and right now ive been with my current bf for a yearamazingly he is a huge anxiety reducergoing places with people where you wont be the only one talking is awesomei can talk if i want but dont feel like all the pressure is on me he is naturally social so it doesnt magnify the pressure like some people do i still get nervous when im in charge of things like if i bought the tickets or whatever but its such a relief and worth working towards im not anxiety free but i dont react with the same levels of stress anymore another one with social anxiety here among others diagnosis socialy anxious since early childhood since ever worsened at my early teenage years and after that no friends anymore being very inhibited is terrible for professional life i restrain myself from choosing this or that path i feel so recluded from the world theres an all world experiences and knowledge that i dont have nor can i do i will share a more in depth story when im available but shortly as of now i was feeling great since i started using meds better than ive ever felt before but now i am starting to feel miserable and i am so much used to feeling well now that i am not accepting this ever i know i need help and i know i cant tell anyone and i know there are only a few things i can do i can accept my path as a genetic alcoholic i can start being anxious every second of the day again or help i cant figure out a third option i was though i dont think this has ever deterred anyone from trying to initiate an interaction in fact they often dont care if im able to hear them seemingly i guess maybe if i wore my big indoors headphones instead of earbuds it would be more obvious hii hang out in the depression and bipolar forum and i suffer from anxiety i want to post this here as well since it is helpful for anxiety it is by dbt peer connections the speaker isnt a therapist but she goes over the dbt therapy techniques pop over to the depression if you want to check out more dbt threads i had such social anxiety i couldnt do presentations one class i had an a in and told the teacher id take a c but i could not present he offered for me to give it just to him and i still couldnt he gave me an a anyway another time i tried really hard to present in front of a large class and my voice started shaking and the professor laughed that incident made up my mind that it is something i am not doing i hate having social anxiety it makes things difficult youre absolutely right people dont get it im glad you have accommodations and are getting the job done kudos to you ok so i was never bullied but ive never really had friends the only friends ive had are my lifelong best friend and his brother i had 2 friends in elementary school one in 2nd grade and one in 5th in middle school i isolated myself and sat at the empty table at lunch and pretty much entertained myself my parents keep bugging me to make friends and talkto people but i dont want to partly because talking to people i dont know gives me this weird anxiety plus im really awkward and partly because i have become comfortable with isolating myself those are my guesses as to why i am this way seriously is this normal i have developed this physical anxiety tight chest a reactive heart knot in my chest for one or two weeks now and i dont know what is causing it ive ruled out the most obvious and common stressors from my routine that could have been causing it the only thing left to rule out is coffee i drink 2 very strong cups of coffee it helps me keep my appetite in check thats the only reason i drink it at all tomorrow i stop drinking coffee altogether and ill know in a couple of days if its the culprit until then i wanted to get your opinions on this subject hi sunny  do you drink enough water  caffeine  dehydrates you  so if you enjoy coffee  have a glass of water with it i have anxiety issues and i understand tachycardia  not fun at all here is the weird thing  if i cant sleep at night  sometimes i will have a cup of coffee  and about a half hour later i am out like a light  really  for some strange reason caffeine makes be sleepy ok so whos crazy  take care keyplayer yeah coffee causes me anxiety as well so i hardly ever drink it anymore its weird but sometimes it has zero effect other times i get very very nervous never have any positive effect of being more awake though my doctor told me to give up coffee because i have bad anxiety i will when im ready right now i want my coffee drinking my second cup as i type lol i switched to decaf a few years ago had a migraine for a couple of days and i was fine i still like the taste of coffee but i feel less anxious now i used to drink a pot of coffee so i wonder why when anxious i have no desire to drink coffee when things calm down i tend to go back for the wake up and also the appetite suppression max is one to two cups a day maybe i should remove it and see how i feel long term havent had any coffee todayso far so goodno physical anxiety no chest anxiety i feel just fine maybe this was it ill know for sure in a few more days thanks for your replies guys appreciate it hi i found that having anxiety andor panic attacks that i had to completely give up all caffeinated drinksi only drink decaf coffee tea etcnothing that will amp me up and i do much better good luck im like this i prefer video games and anime over socializing when i have free time most of the time im content with being like this however there are times when i get lonely and wish i had somebody to talk to i guess the question to ask yourself is are you truly happy if so then there is nothing wrong with living the way you do if not than it might be best to figure out whats bothering you and work on a goal to do something about it sounds a lot like me im not so certain that there is a normal were social animals historically speaking a primate who is alone is a primate who would not be living very long because its our social structure that keeps us alive in modern times our artificial society allows us to be more isolated and to spend money as we engage in very limited and superficial social interactions ie going to the grocery store i had a bunch of friends on social networking something went wrong and i wont get into it here but i learned the hard way that none of them were really my friends since then ive felt some selfapplied pressure to get some friends but then i wonder if i really have to do that in the first place since then ive made one friend by accident its cool we keep things light so no getting into deep or dark personal problems thats why i pay a therapist is it normal my answer to that is that normal doesnt exist if you feel fine then go with what you are doing if you need a friend then you can try to make a friend burdening yourself with what might or might not be normal could lead to forcing the issue and i think that you dont really need to go there you are good for you for your place in time your situation and status will be everchanging based on need and opportunity flow with it i have always found friends to be very stressful they add so many things to worry about and pay attention to its overwhelming plus i have trust issues so i always question whether they actually like me i am lucky enough to have a long term friend who is like a sister to me and has seen me at my worst so i dont have to worry about what she thinks of me i do have a few other friends and my relationships with them are good but i have to push through a lot of anxiety to be with them i hope this will get better for you i know it is hard to change the way youve been for essentially your entire life i wasnt ever dxed as selective mutism but i believe i had it during my jr high years my guidance counselor in high school made me join activities and after a year a feeling terrible and anxious and not knowing what to say to anyone without breaking into a sweat i started getting used to it and my anxiety decreased years later i got therapy and that helped much more current friends and loved one actually think im chattyit takes work though to get to a point where you are at ease it does not go away by itself i lost my voice completely for about a year as a child read my voice was beaten out of me until i started dealing with the effects of child abuse  domestic violence i never thought too much about it however since i was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder my selective mutism has become a lot more recognisable i used to discount the incidents where i couldnt speak as a young adult but living in a very violent abusive environment meant mutism happened quite a bit one of my personalities is mostly mute  she created her own sign language to communicate and im still trying to understand it when she surfaces 95 of the time its anxiety that triggers selective mutism in me but sometimes i really dont want to talk at all and when im able to be silent it feels like the most relaxing thing ever those times are rare though i wasnt officially diagnosed with selective mutism but i believe i suffered it as a kid due to social anxiety in my case in kindergarten i wouldnt talk and teachers told my parents that i only said a few words the entire school year if i was called on in class i would tense up ended up biting myself because i was so anxious my parents were told but was still never sent to therapy when i was 14 i ended up failing a few presentations in school because of social anxiety not selective mutism but even when i was chosen in class to answer a question i was so anxious and wanted to cry but anyways i learned about social anxiety disorder and mental illness in general for the first time and i requested that i see a pdoc for my anxiety issues years of therapy and now i am able to answer questions in the class no problem my problems are mainly social anxiety related now than selective mutism i think my problems were always social anxiety but selective mutism was just a severe manifestation of it all when i was younger so now i dont have selective mutism i had never officially been diagnosed with it but i probably did have some form of it i would refuse to talk to teachers uncles aunts etc but would be ok talking with kids my own age this went on until 7th grade it seemed to have come back when i became an adult im 24 and i can only talk to a few people in my group i dont always ignore them but sometime when they say hi i dont really say much of anything to them its like my vocal chords freeze i feel bad but its almost like i am physically unable to speak to them i still struggle with talking to close family members but i am very active on social media so i communicate with family members there i feel bad about it sometimes like we got a new neighbor and i couldnt really say much to her i just froze whats weird though is 1317 i talked fine and was actually very talkative and joked around with people of all ages then when i was 18 the traits of selective mute came back kind of all of a sudden im wondering if it was just an example of the fact that your brain doesnt fully develop until your 18 i really dont know if you know how to dance pick a partner if you dont know how to dance pick a partner or alternate hanging around by the food and punch with sitting down i hope it wont be too bad but id be terrified in a situation like that it worked in junior high my best lifelong friend danced with me and we didnt care how we looked it was a lifesaver good luck i had to give a similar speech as salutatorianit wasnt that bad when i was actually up there but as i see it here are your options when they ask tell them to get the salutatorian instead or maybe number 3 if no 2 already gives a speech then youll be off the hook option 2 get therapy or medication to help you before then its likely youll have to give speeches as part of work or college so it helps to get this issue taken care of if you dont give the speech dont be surprised if they force you to see a counselor or some suchschools like comformity thank you all i asked my counselors and they said that the speeches are mandatory if you decide to accept being valedictorian so i think ive decided to just give up the title at least ill still have the high gpa on record i just wanted to thank you all for your advice and input theres a line in hg wells war of the worlds that crosses my mind a lot i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this mysterious deathas swift as the passage of lightwould leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down thats kind of how i feel sometimes im doing so much to get myself to a better place scrambling for safety as it were but i feel i am being toyed with by my anxiety like its just biding its time and will strike at me again just as i reach a good place it took awhile i had to begin by driving with my hubby then when he got tired of going with me to my appointments i had no choice and he needs me to pick him up on occasion i picked him up from the airport last night he is pushing me out of my comfort zone to help me im a little better when i first get behind the wheel but the nervousness makes it difficult to concentrate and ivery made errors that i shouldnt almost causing me to get into accidents it hope to get better with practice a huge step up considering i was paralized by such fear that i once couldnt even leave my bedroom it can be done some triggering material mentioned in this warning i have realized now that i have a really bad fear of pain it mainly shows itself in my fear of falling as i dont want to get hurt if i do fall but i cant say why i am scared of pain i know humans dont like to experience pain but i feel mine is really bad the fear its the main thing that holds me back from possible trigger self harming more severely and suicide function rejtgomb tag

thisinnertext   gombvalue  show   i just am really scared of pain does anybody have problems with being alone specifically if your out in public my anxiety overwhelms me when im out and about its not so bad when i have somebody with me usually a family member but im still on high alert for anything or anybody who may be laughing or looking at me its a weird feeling i get nervous that im going to embarrass myself or look stupid in front of strangers its also worse if im at a gathering with friends i will stay quiet because i dont want to say something stupid i will go as far as avoiding hanging out with my friends too because im soo scared i hate parties or anything like that basically anything where im around people im on alert and terrified i try my best to hide it and im not sure if my friends will understand how scary it is for me to be around people i only feel comfortable hanging out at my house too  if im in my room im okay but if i have to go to their house i start to panic im also scared of driving especially on highways but that stems from my ptsd i lost 4 of my cousins in a wreck when i was 11 and ever since then ive been super scared to drive my mom eventually got me to come around to the idea of driving when i was like 19 and i got my license around 21 idk  i feel like an idiot because these are things i shouldnt be afraid of but i am my anxiety keeps me from doing a lot of things and i wish it would just go away already since 2012 ive gotten bad anxiety after drinking apple juice i mentioned it to my therapist who denied that it made me anxious i has not had apple juice in awhile but yesterday i bought a bottle of 100 percent apple juice i drank about 40 oz of it tonight im literally shaking from my anxiety i realized half an hour ago that it was once again the apple juice i googled it and apple juice is bad for people with anxiety because most apple juice tests positive for arensic which can cause anxious behaviors so it wasnt just in my head does this happen to anyone else ive never really noticed it or payyed much attention to it i get anxious a lot i never wondered was it because i drank apple juice though i dont drink apple juice too much now you have me curious definitely feeling that way here working on cognitive behavior therapy group called recovery inc ive only been to one meeting but it seems promising maybe theres a support group in your area i googled support for agoraphobia and was happy to find something in my area whats cool about it is a lot of healthy ways to change the way we think theres actually probably info in this forum somewhere theres just so much here which is awesome sorry about your cousins thats really sad and can see why you have that ptsd about driving i havent driven on freeways in many years ive been told many times to face my fears a little bit each day i drove one exit on the expressway a few years back and just didnt want to work that hard i guess i wish you the best keep trying and dont give up even the tiny steps are something to feel good about im cheering for you xo sans no youre not an idiot and i can definitely relate to many of the aspects you mentioned being alone on my own is the best thing for me at this stage but being alone in public my goodness im constantly  and i mean constantly  going through all the coping strategies i know its awful but sometimes i have a good day so thats okay youre not alone in your struggles sonjaward809 trust me theres a good possibility you can work your way through and even overcome these anxieties as well so keep fighting and dont give up youll get there eventually dont worry apple juice can trigger anxious feelings because of the high sugar content which can increase adrenaline and blood sugar this can lead to the feeling of having a panic attack some apple juice can contain arsenic but i doubt it contains enough to evoke such anxious feelings otherwise there would be many more complaints and the brand would not stay on the shelves anxiety is a powerful thing if our brain expects to become anxious from something whether it be apple juice or going outside of the house then it can become a selffulfilling prophecy the best way to overcome that is to expose ourselves to that which makes us anxious if it can be done safely you could also avoid apple juice but i would consider that an avoidance behaviour my anxiety was fine until i realized i had 4 cans and bottles of soda today i really shouldnt be drinking any soda because the effect it has on my teeth not sure why i didnt even realize i was that stressed out but i spent a large portion of the day with the worst tension headache ive ever had ive had this for several years now where my anxiety has got really bad and i have really bad physical pain so i check in to the hospital and say i think im having a heart attack they do all these tests tell me my heart is fine and say its just my level of anxiety few days later it repeats i go back in complain of a heart attack only to waste their time because my heart is fine its natural you get bad anxiety youre gonna have physical stomach pain but i need to stop this heart attack crap its not only wasting their time but its not really helping me either i know my hearts fine so why bother telling them it isnt and have all these tests i have similar anxiety about heart attacks i sometimes get chest pressure which i think is caused by anxiety but i worry when it happens i think part of this for me is my stepdad died of a heart attack at age 56 i am 59 and i know i dont have his genetic risk factors but i still worry sometimes i wish i had an ekg machine at home so i could see i am okay when these episodes occur i have xanax for anxiety but it only makes me sleepy and i still feel anxious hope youre feeling better now i have what i presume would be called cardiac arrhythmia and i also experience what feels like shortness of breath from timetotime im not actually short of breath but it feels like i am i havent sought medical treatment for any of it though im kindof doctor avoidant i get this all the time one thing that helped me was to go for a run and get my heart pumping to overcome the anxiety same here i used to stay running back and forth to hospitals and doctors because i thought i was having a heart attack even went to a specialist for the heart of course nothing wrong with my ticker just my anxiety as usual its hard but put things in perspective if i were really having one would i be upright and able to complain about it thats how i get through mines thats deffenetly a thought i dont think if i was having one idd be able to complain about it anyway hmm i dont know where is the heart anyway is it on the left or the right does this happen to anyone else i have a bad habit of worrying about bad stuff that didnt happen sometimes i get so sick to my stomach thinking of what could have happened one thing that really bothers me is when i got my wisdom teeth out my doctor said i could take my meds but i decided to wait until after the surgery i didnt wake up right away from being put to sleep it almost seemed like they were panicking when i finally came to it im so scared that if i had taken my meds i would have died also i dropped my electric toothbrush cord into the sink with the water running and i stupidly impulsively reached for it and took it out of the sink right after that i got sick to my stomach realizing i could of been electrocuted ok these bad things didnt happen so shouldnt i just let them go am i alone do you get anxious over seemingly trivial matters do you feel embarassed and guilt ridden awkward i do all the time and i worry even more that people will laugh or think i am weird i feel humiliated as a result all too often tonight i am supposed to be test driving several vehicles on my short list i have been worrying about this since i made the appointment yesterday and this worry is going to fester all day today i am worried that i will make a fool of myself in front of the salesman who no doubt will come along ive had no car of my own for near two years so dont drive often i am in a new city i am unfamiliar with this shouldnt be difficult though so i feel idiotic as well why do i make mountains out of mole hills people take test drives all the time this is such a stupid thing to be frightened of there is so much more going on in my life to feel anxious about rather than this trivial matter you are not alone i obsess and worry about those types of things like going through check out lanes in the grocery store once you start worrying its hard to stop but once you are there it gets a little easier and afterwards you think ok that wasnt as bad as i imagined that is anxiety for you playing with your imagination your feelings and makes you feel stupid after too but i try to take it each time as a mm on a ruler i will go forward a bit each time and maybe one day i wont need the whole day to mentally prepare a run to go get groceries i went to the doctors about chest pain which i assume is anxiety but they wanted to do some tests and one was an ecg and you have to be naked waist up and i hate it when i know someone will look at me in general but it was very anxiety provoking she kept trying to tell me to relax but that wasnt going to happen with me being half naked she kept saying its a painless test and i honestly didnt care about the pain i just didnt want to have my chest exposed this has always been a trigger for me for years i cant wear a v neck shirt because i am afraid of people looking at me now i also get anxiety from gender dysphoria too so this didnt help how do you deal with anxiety about people looking at you nakedhalfnakedexposed i havent been to the doctor in years or the dentist too afraid i wish i had advice what if you told them your anxiety perhaps they can cover you up once electrodes are attached or same sex nurses etc i am sure they have had patients with anxiety before and might be able to make adjustments i had a panic attack while having my last ecg im not comfortable either but i just suck it up because it needs to be done nike ive had several of these tests and on each occasion i was given an open gown to wear they were able to reach beneath the gown to attach the sensors while i still felt vulnerable i wasnt completed exposed so i am really bothered by how they did this in your case in the future ask if you can have a gown to wear in the meantime i feel your awkwardness and humiliation it is frightening enough just having to have such a test to begin with let alone humiliating you and making you all the more anxious i tend to use a script when talking to people and if something is asked and i dont know how to respond right away i get really anxious strangers tend to make me really anxious the former is just because i have autism but the strangers part is more social anxiety i feel like i hate having to dumb myself down when talking to certain people that bring up conversations with me that are completely uninteresting and petty i struggle with being nice to other girls in particular because i feel like im surrounded by simple minded people that do not have any interest at all in engaging themselves in current topics or their personal thoughts and beliefs on science research society etc my boyfriend probably hates bringing me around his friends wives i went to go play at an open mic at this music shop i felt a bit clumsymore so my anxiety was making me shake so i tried moving around while playing alot of people played before i did now this is what is worrying me i bumped into the microphone and my mouth touched it i am a bit on edge as i keep hearing on the news about the flu and pneumiaspelling i was already on antibiotics for 10 days because i went to the doctor and he told me i had bronchitis im worried that could turn into something worse since my mouth touched the mic when i got back home i immediatly washed my face and brushed my teeth this is probably dumb to worry about anyone else get anxiety over stuff like this anyone else have this for example imwould not say im a germaphobe im more just afraid of getting sick from germs last night i took my glasses off and kinda tossed them on my desk but a few seconds later they fell on the ground and ive just ever since been worrying even if i wash them they are gonna have germs on them and make me sick when i eventually have to wear them again does anyone else get anxiety over things similiar like this im a microbiologistright now the bacteria in poop are the hottest new trendpeople are getting other peoples poop implanted to help cure disease this is an actual medical procedure in comparison your glasses will be fine any one here ever have anxiety attacks while sleeping its weird how it happened  i was sleep like usual maybe partially awake subconsciously i thought someone else was walking in my house i woke up immediately frozen still couldnt move its like i was paralyzed i could move eventually within in seconds but i tried to keep still because i really thought there was an intruder of course the thoughts were rolling in my head what if someone was really in the house what if they hurt my grandma or aunt what if i was having some physical ailment like a stroke no one else was in the house and ive calmed down but im still a little freaked out about this anyone else ever experienced having anxiety attacks during your sleep and if so howd you cope oh geez i do not like going anywhere during flu season because i freak about catching something there i wont touch my food with my bare hands if i havent washed them at least twice before sometimes this gets really annoying its more embarrassing than anything else yet i did mention it to my therapist and turns out she feels similar sometimes at least i got a huge laugh out of it thinking oh well then it cant be too bad if you think your therapist is helping ask if there is a way to see her after university if she cant ask if she can refer you to someone with the same methods as her the last therapist i saw for about 2 years things started out pretty well but it was towards the end i realized i wasnt any better now than i was when i started and i only felt good when in the session i tried pretty much every intervention she offered but nothing seemed to work after she betrayed my trust and agreed with my wife things really took a dive i started seeing her once a month cuz insurance did not pay and money is tight but it got to be the same conversation every month this sounds kindof like sleep paralysis i havent had any episodes of it now for quite a few years but when i was young i did and for years i didnt understand what was happening it was terrifying i gradually learned to focus my attention on the index finger of my right hand and once i could move that the paralysis dissipated ive read that sleep paralysis is more likely to occur if one is sleeping on ones back one of the sleep paralysis dreams i had was i was at one of my aunts homes their house was on a busy street  had a long driveway in my dream i was laying down crosswise of the driveway  i would roll out into the street there would be cars coming but i couldnt get out of the way it seems funny now but at the time i recall being scared stiff pun intended i know from reading other members posts on this subject that other people whove had sleep paralysis have had different experiences some as i recall not dissimilar to yours anyway hopefully in your case this is just a oneoff  you wont continue to have these experiences i wish you well all the time i have ocd too so thats what causes mine im constantly cleaning and disinfecting things with flu season in full effect im a little worried about it i got the flu shot for the first time in 8 years im terrified i made kind of a big fuss and made my brother get his first flu shot in his life i have not gotten the flu since 2006 and ive only had the flu shot 3 times since then so im praying im ok with the flu shot it seems the incidents ive heard about on the news are about people who didnt get the flu shot i get anxiety about bad stuff that didnt happen and im worried if i hadnt seen this article on facebook i wouldnt have thought to get the flu shot i basically live under a rock and dont pay attention to current events like i had no idea about the government shut down until it actually happened im horrible at interacting with others in person heck even on the phone i have trouble unless im superrr comfortable with them most of the time im quiet because i dont know what to say or that im going to embarrass myself i try to remember what to say but i go blank 90 of the time im okay with my most immediate family members but new people usually think im rude because i wont speak little do they know im just terrified lol hopefully one day talking to others gets better i am pretty good not necessarily comfortable though i figure i come from the idea that a good offense is the best defense inwardly it is painful but i put on a mask of gregarious confidence i am fighting the urge to take flight but force myself to work the room it is exhausting always being at the ready i feel like im either too sharp or too loud when i talk to people i dont feel comfortable at all i am pretty good with strangers because i know i wont have to come up with more stuff to talk about because ill only see them for a short time when it comes to having to get to know someone thats when i feel my most uncomfortable im struggling with this right now very very much happy new year everyone anxious today but not as much as usual just some mild stomach pain im stressed though just have a lot on my mind lately i can respond and make conversations okay as long as my mood is stable but i do need to make sure my mind doesnt start racing by keeping myself composed but no ive always found social interactions to be difficult i have a lot of trust issues was okay for a while there but then it got worse i think ill be working on it for the rest of my life to be honest i have social anxiety so no unfortunately preface i am slightly autistic i have aspergers syndrome i wonder if that contributes to these issues i have been obsessed and overstressed by this math competition i have to take very soon i am not very good at it on top of that i believe it is causing me very high stress to the point of disassociation and delusion yesterday just before bed i worked for a very long time on practicing for the competition i barely understood what i was doing and spent a lot of my energy that was a bad idea since i created an extreme amount of stress i suddenly became aware that i was deathly tired i became convinced i would die i was going to die in my sleep i also became convinced i was in dreamland again my mind when under high stress tends to turn the most random noises into the scariest noises scary voices sounds etc i also have the tendency to become paranoid over the dumbest things for instance last week i heard one of those emergency tests on the radio they accidentally made a mistake and said civil danger warning i must of missed them saying it was a test because i then became convinced north korea was sending a nuclear bomb i then became convinced that i was in a dream and my family was not real later that day i couldnt find my brother and i began to doubt his existence all year i was paranoid about going outside before 300 i thought i was going to be caught by police and accused of escaping school i am actually homeschooled so i get school done quicker i am also 2 grade levels ahead i tested 97 percentile on the california achievement test i am still worried about going outside  im afraid the police will not like me flying my drone around note i do go outside and i always become anxious at night time if i had a bad day i can turn shadows in my room into the scariest things inside my mind thats not the worst of it one night i was convinced that there was a blackclothed ghost with a white face hiding in the corner of the room with an axe for me i did not hallucinate it i just feared it i went and got a glass of water and the fear did seem to subside when i was younger i was often paranoid about a chimpanzee that was going to kill me i was scared of going to the zoo for years i still am a bit when i am under stress i doubt reality and often fill in areas of my day that i forgot in my mind with dreams this leads to me getting my dreammemories mixed up with real life my dreams are extremely realistic is there a scientific explanation for this and is there a scientific name for this thanks everyone i find it difficult when i feel trapped by a conversation i dont know when the other person is going to stop talking or how i can get out of it without being rude or abrupt i dont like first inpressions when one on one like interviews but besides that i dont usually get nervous in social situations if anything i get irritated by all the people i get uncomfortable talking to strangers or people i havent seen in a while specially on social gatherings i crave social interactions but i also find them draining to me conversations have patterns its like a dance or a tennis match one wrong reply could mess up the rhythm or lose the game i get tired of being super nice so not to cause offence i get tired of my older colleagues who dont like to listen to me just because im younger i pretty much memorise the pattern of certain conversations hi how are you im fine thanks how are you did you have a good weekend it was ok how was yours and so on i have to go through my memory before hand to plan out what im going to say even non face to face conversations i have to plan out before engaging in them ok so my nose is huge and the main cause of my anxiety and i always think people are laughing at it when im out of the house am i being realistic i was in another forum and they said i might have bdd but i feel like im being realisticshould i save up for surgery your nose looks perfectly normal to me and im not saying that just to be nice if you got surgery on it it would actually look too small have you considered therapy for your bdd i hope you will continue to go to counselling for this it must be difficult to see something one way and have everyone else say different but please believe me when i say your nose looks fine ok i was expecting to see a large nose its really not that big anxiety growing with each new day i am feeling less confident and more and more worthless too i have to find a job  soon i received my last disability check today and will need an income with which to pay rent come february i knew full well this was a crappy time of year to be looking for one as of this date i have applied for 26 jobs  and not heard from a single one this is all very disconcerting and hits my confidence and selfesteem quite hard what is wrong with me i am asking myself it is reaching the point that i worry too that i am suffering paranoia and jumping to every negative conclusion that can be thought of this is not a situation i have ever been in before ive normally had a choice of job offers i am really freaking out hi everyone ive been working with a therapist for the past 6 months as ive been struggling with my mental health again over the years it has manifested itself in different forms from ocdhoarding germ fear contamination fear weight losseating disorders i could go on it peaks and troughs and normally emerges after a period of stress working with my therapist weve finally come to the bottom of something and believe it stems from separation anxiety disorder as a very young child i was incredibly clingy and didnt spend a day away from my mum until i was 15 never stayed over at friends never went away on trips trouble sleeping didnt want to be left alone etc classic sad which unfortunately my parents didnt recognise and didnt nip in the bud fast forward 37 years and we believe this is likely at the root of my ongoing issues my question is how do i resolve this clearly i dont have sad from my parents anymore so how is it resolved ive tried treating the symptoms directly such as ocd as and when they manifest with limited success but something always reemerges and i want it to stop i meditate take herbal antianxiety supplements write poetry and talk it through with my therapist but really want to tackle the underlying issue head on any help greatly appreciated thanks steve still dont know what hours daughters boyfriend will be working christmas eve im rather nervous about this because i want to be able to plan that day and know what were doing it makes me anxious that he waits until the last minute to do things it reminds me of my last abuser who did the same thing and bragged about it on the plus side everyone liked the apple pie so i will do hat friday my daughter is still making cookies on saturday for her boyfriends familys holiday dinner try to work on new software to stay busy so yeah that kind of day made it through my bad anxiety over driving to place im not familiar and working in a not so great part of town today it was really hard for me dealing with a lot of anxiety over insurance changes too hello steve i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit im sorry i cannot be of help with regard to your concerns however here are links to 2 articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of some interest i dont know of course if youre here simply seeking advice with regard to this particular concern or if you plan to hang in here with us however should you be planning to continue on we hope you do may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting ps one other thing i can offer is that trying to stop something such anxiety intrusive thoughts etc is i believe prettymuch generally recognized not to work in fact it tends to make matters worse there is a practice that is referred to as compassionate abiding wherein one simply allows ones anxiety intrusive thoughts or whatever to arise  fade at their own pace without reacting to them or fighting against them you mentioned that you meditate compassionate abiding would fit in nicely with that practice heres a link to a description of the practice may it be of benefit i was in the same boat as you always with my parents as some point or another up until college i had very little friends and didnt really hang out like most teens should in college it did get better i started being more social and more away from my parents i still struggle with anxiety ocd and depression but its much better you said it reemerges is something that triggers the symptoms to reemerges when that happens to me usually say im having a setback and i try find what triggered my setback finding the source then helps me realize what i fears and triggers i still need to work on i flood a lot of toilets pretty much every one except my own although i do flood it quite a bit i completely flooded a doctors office and i made quite a mess in a big lots i also messed up my uncles so now im terrified of using anyones toilet except to pee its gotten to the point where im so uncomfortable but i refuse to go except at my own its not even really a fear its just a bad idea to use anyone elses toilet does anyone have any suggestions isnt it just obvious i should wait until i get home btw i dont eat that much and what i do eat is pretty healthy so i have no idea whats going on more than likely tmi but i have a real problem with diarrh both from anxiety and as a side effect of my bipolar meds i have found that taking imodium twice a week has made things almost normal i have the too soft problem myself and it likely stems from all the anxiety it possesses its own problems while in a public washroom and i try not to go if i can help it i agree about the consideration of how much toilet paper is being used i was clogging my own toilet on risperidone i was so constipatedit could very well be your meds i was eating almost entirely vegetarian so it wasnt low fiber for me i changed to abilify and that helped a lot hi folks i am wondering if anyone of you has developed strategies to get over this constant brain fog caused by anxiety no physical reasons i find it really hard to focus and all i pay attention to is this fogginess in my head that comes with pressure i cant really think clearly and it is just starting to annoy the hell out of me i have tried relaxation but i cant even focus on that anything that has worked for you hmmmm well i dont know as i have any particularly great strategies to offer you but i certainly understand the problem i have a lot of freefloating anxiety i dont even have anything to feel anxious about but im an older person and i think after so many years filled with anxiety my body just doesnt know how to function any other way plus i have menieres disease a condition of the inner ear that causes tinnitus dizziness  balance issues so i experience what i typically refer to as a headinafishbowl kind of effect prettymuch 24 7 i walk our dog a couple of times a day and this seems to help at least temporarily ive never found sitting meditation or relaxation techniques to be particularly helpful i do some walking meditation  ive done some mindfulness yoga but basically i just live with my brain fog i dont know how one gets rid of it there is a technique which is referred to as compassionate abiding which might be of some help to you heres a link to a description of the practice may it be of benefit so does mindfulness and positive thinking really work i havent had much luck lots of negative thoughts since i have been verbally abused moms there to smash any ambition i have after working over 60 hours in a 3day span i dont have the energy to have anxiety hi palsera i really believe mindfulness and positive thinking work and its a constant effort to use them for some of us its natural and easy to think negatively it requires work to replace the negative thoughts i like to watch mindfulness videos on youtube and also hypnotherapy videos for positive thinking best wishes on your path sans and i was the last poster in that thread i feel so honoured i really do i went back to work today after having last week off i am surprised that my anxiety level wasnt severe today although i have a headache tonight im so impressed how well u all seem to handle this anxiety monster handled a lot of things but this anxiety is winning need to go grocery shopping but dont want to leave the house even with anxiety pills in my pocket purse car always within reach course being in control of myself has always been my thing if powers that be r trying to teach me something i dont know what it is but i officially holler uncle im feeling okay at the moment nothing extreme in november last month ive been dealing with daily bouts of anxiety that go up and down it sucks but i still manage to maintain despite my anxiety i had an anxiety attack this morning my stomach stills feels uneasy i see pdoc tonight im nervous i have nothing against pdoc but her office triggers my ptsd a bit so it can be hard to go there but shes a good doctor and i only see her once a month so i keep going i saw the therapist today and talked about a few rough dates ahead she suggested i get a prescription i havent been taking my pills during the day because i need to stay sharp at work i just realized that i could open my gabapentin capsules and dump out half and that may be all i need im going to try that made cinnamon rolls this morning ugh too much sugar now im jittery and waiting for this afternoon is taking forever i woke up from a dream believing i had gained 60 pounds back that i lost many years ago which gave me an anxiety attack it took me years to get that weight off ive calmed down but im still feeling a little nervous i was admitted to a mother and baby unit for postnatal depression and anxiety my husband has been abusive i reported him they have me on medication to help calm me i cant go home to him im hoping the domestic abuse workers can help me but everything has been on standstill over christmas im afraid of how hell react when he finds out i reported him and im not coming home i havent posted here for a while regarding my anxiety i have been in such a state for weeks and now i am in all out fear and stress mode my disability assistance is being cut off the last cheque is for january i am struggling to find work i need an income in january so as to pay my rent for february christmas is over whew my husband and i are working on goals for next year like everything else its dependent on keeping track of things and having selfdiscipline i am really nervous about next year though so i hope outside influences dont ruin everything i have been feeling tense and sort of anxious due to having an anxiety attack last week i want to get my mind occupied again but my college class doesnt start until next month i only have 4h left to sleep but i cant stop stressing about tomorrow night i wish i could just cancel all my plans and run away and hide from the world until like the 2nd week of january this time of the year is extremely difficult and its triggering so many memories that im not being able to cope with was starting to feel better then a bunch of little annoyances happened glasses broke hard drive crashed lucky it was part of a raid so i didnt lose anything spilled coffee all over my sweaterthe list goes on plus my sleep was disrupted and had strange dreams despite all this im okay im grateful we had money to replace the drive and my husband used a nose piece from an old pair of glasses happy new year to those that celebrate it im up past 4 am i just dont want to go to bed because i dont want to face the morning my typical morning anxiety seems like it might be worse being the last day off before i go back to work and having to face the new year as well january is the worst month with quarterend work plus yearend work i did fairly well the past few days while out of the house on my staycation i had my phone with me so i guess i had my main distraction that i used intermittently i had trouble with the long drives so i just resorted to daydreaming to distract myself from anxious thoughts i nearly missed an exit i wish i could just be comfortable enough to be present frankly i could have had a real vacation but i just didnt feel up to it sadly im glad we didnt go anywhere because i just want to be home i had a massive panic attack today still feeling the aftermath anxious day today and the first day back to work coming on the forum relieved it but that isnt the way to get work done its going to be a busy month with all the yearend reporting i found a roof vent on the ground but i dont know if it is mine or my neighbors since it landed between our houses im worried that i might have raccoons in the attic i have a roof inspector coming over tomorrow my therapist threw me under the bus after five consultations called four law enforcement officers with guns drawn and abandoned me i never touched her in anyway but a genteel handshake i kept reassuring her i would never harm you which is true  i would feel less than a man to hit a woman which i have never did in my life if i was suicidal i would have killed myself with four officers yelling  we know you are in there  do you want us to knock down your door we are coming in i didnt open it  felt like saying  get a warrant they didnt come in after five therapy sessions my treatment was look at these meditation videos on the internet and law enforcement which really helped my anxiety disorder which i suffer from  dont you think moderation i agree with raven id see someone else not all professionals are like that i get why i was anxious yesterday  dentist appt with hygienist so close to me hanging over my head followed by eating in a restaurant but today i cannot stop shaking at work and there is literally no one else around in my office to make me feel anxious yes i will find another therapist this one was  too young 2 yrs in practice  too impulsive  and too affected by what her patients say or write instead of analyzing what i was saying and why she couldnt handle me i think i made her insane i told her you know  if you are uncomfortable with patients  i know a therapist you can see granted my conversations were not politically correct and polite but never rude  i thought i should open up to her so she should know the bad stuff about me to plan a treatment plan to make me a better person sincerely moderation started and finished a project for my home office like most house things i was driven to finish everything today i would have to force myself to stop so i can rest my body i was anxious and restless until it was done so now im sore and tired and i still have to make dinner ugh we could go out but this is a lean month and we already bought a bunch of groceries i started out the week with low anxiety and a sense of control i think it was the relief of the holidays being over today after 4 days at work my anxiety is high again all day things were going wrong at work and i felt angry and irritable at people and objects its rare that i get angrymost things dont affect me in that way a big difference from my calm tuesday struggling this morning with anxiety and feeling depressed so sad that the anxious part of my mind steals hours and days from methis has to stop i hate it jenniferim so sorry i hope youre feeling better i am working with the anxiety i was able to get the laundry done i usually do the minimum but today i decided to try to do more i did a little more around the place maybe 45 min worth not a lot but more than the bare minimum much needed and not perfect been feeling restless today  like i cant sit still ugh its irritating  i dont have any antianxiety meds because the clinic i go to wont fill my prescription for ativan even though its the only thing ive tried that works ive tried buspar hydroxyzine and gapabentin but none of them ever helped so i have to wait until the 22nd to see my pdoc and see if he will push the prescription through i doubt he will he will probably tell me to keep trying the hydroxyzine but its been a few months that ive been on it and it doesnt work tough time for the four officers with their guns drawn after what my therapist probably told them they thought i was going to kill them  no way my father was a police officer  but its like you read in the news  the police get the wrong information and come scared and ready to kill i did tell my therapist i defended myself outside a bar after i was attacked by three 64 250 lb drunks who didnt like me buying drinks and talking to their girlfriends all night but waited until i left to confront me in the parking lot to attack me i warned the boys you really dont want to do this they laughed im 58 170 but a brown belt in karate a bigger bruce lee they started to attack me and well after 5min they wished they wouldnt have attacked me they were all sleeping fine just unconscious maybe when they wake up they wont do this to someone else i am feeling quite panicky tonight its been building up all afternoon and im not sure whats really caused it i think part of its down to losing lots of time hours and part of its because i dropped my phone on the floor and now i cant turn it on and may need to get a new one i also feel rather full because i ate my takeaway way too quickly which i know i shouldnt do but what ever its done now i just hope i dont have a panic attack tonight but it does feel like i might you know when you just know i got through the night without having a panic attack and i was so close to having one so its good i didnt anxiety is currently quite low a little bit of anxiety but i cant really place what its over hi moderation is it weird i thought you were another admin account you know moderators welcome to the forum that should give you some information about what they are but with that said its diffrent for diffrent people and for me one of the worst things is not being able to breav i hope you like the forums having severe anxiety and panic attacks over a surgery im undergoing tomorrow just cant calm down worse attack ive had yet its not even particularly risky i dont know what the problem is but every time i stand up i get light headed and my vision goes black dont know how i can prepare for surgery like this restlessness has returned its now compounded by a cold from another family member were working through it but im more worried about my husband since he has ms one day at a time school has also started but i think i can handle the class this time at least im going to try to had high anxiety this afternoon something that was meant to come for me arived half an hour late and i totally freaked about it now it is quite low as its all arived and all okay so my anxiety is low today as i took some prn meds last night im a little foggy but today is the least anxious ive felt in over a week so grateful to have a little peace today however i have no motivation so which is better being a little anxious and productive or drugged and calm i struggle with any middle ground between the two finally starting to get over this cold had physical therapy today and working out in the pool there was helpful keeping busy masks over the restlessness were getting a small treadmill tomorrow morning so the christmas tree needs to come down this afternoon weve been putting it off but now we cant i still have lights draped over the mantle so im good there i dont like waiting until the last minute but with us being sick and having appointments there wasnt much to do im biting the anxiety bullet really high anxiety today so thism orning i got an email asking if on monday this monday soeone can come and see me and talk my move to this new place in febuary remember i got evicted well it took me ages to respond because i dont want to know the day i sort of do but knowing it will increase my anxiety as their are other issues to deal with such as strange people agoraphobia but i eventually wrote back agreeing to see them monday afternoon i just hope ive made the right decision and i can cope with the outcome anxiety is controlling me today someone has been trying to contact me that i really dont want to talk to but i emailed him and agreed to phone him today to get it over withi hope that will help even though i dread the call i feel like ive had a panic attack on my tail all day but i managed to outmaneuver and avoid it and had a decent day instead im very tired of fighting the battle with anxiety why cant i just be calm i have nothing bad happening in my life just the opposite but im scared and confused i just want to relax a little and enjoy my life why do i struggle with this im reading all types of things to try but i struggle to take consistent action i guess im looking for a magical fix instead of the hard work it takes to improve i tend to do the minimum and therein lies my major problem i think i have an aversion to hard work and so im stuck in this crappy mood where i feel like a scared little kid i talked to the person that was wanting to contact me i feel a slight relief it is strange how certain situations can ramp up the anxiety the situation might even be as simple as having to talk to someone that feels like a threat the person i talked to was nice to me i think i was overly worried about being embarrassed by the topic he was contacting me about i did feel some of that and some worry about his judgement i have to learn to stop letting fear of judgement and embarrassment stop controlling me how do you learn to let go of that fear yesterday was a doozy our small treadmill turned out to be over 200 lbs we had a heck of a time getting it down to the basement my husband and i are so sore i kept apologizing for buying such a heavy piece had another early morning finished my homework for the week probably will chill out for most of the day and maybe take a nap my anxiety isnt bad but will know more later today some anxiety about stomach pains but other than that im just peachy daughters boyfriend lost his bearded dragon this morning he had it since he was nine or so and it was old he was really upset and touchy so were all trying to soothe him and help him out he went to work early to get his mind off of it but we know how it goes im concerned i may have some rebound anxiety that i sometimes have when im taking care of other people in crisis i seem to be okay for the moment other than that and pushing a bunch of snow off the drivewayi would say it was a quiet day but it just hasnt made muffins for breakfast because theres no way we were going to risk our necks and only car out in this snow still the waiting game in the meantime my military disability benefit was approved i am really anxious  and shouldnt be what if they deem me not sick enough to have been awarded it i worry about the walk to the meeting the sidewalks are sheets of glare ice i have boot krampons but am still terrified to go out onto the street my anxiety has been pretty good today only flared up when i had to go grocery shopping by myself a few hours ago i tend to panic a little in public if im alone but that feeling is gone now that im home i did manage to walk to the gas station by myself today though it was mainly just cold and my anxiety was only hightened when i was walking there mainly because it was icy and i was scared of embarrassing myself by slipping and falling or that a stranger would try and talk to me im really nervous about people i dont know but thankfully i didnt fall i slipped a few times but that was it overall it was a good day for my anxiety well today was a good day for my anxiety considering i didnt wake up till around noon then fell back asleep for 4 hours at 12 pm  so most of my day i was asleep i had a hard time sleeping last night though i felt woundup  had to take a seroquel to finally get some sleep i think the seroquel is why i was soo tired today though so im going to try and skip it tonight if possible overall though my anxiety hasnt been pretty bad these past few days i get worried though because im scared it will all come back at once then ill panic and i dont have any prns for my anxiety anymore so ill be a mess doing better today though ive been munching on carbs all day after my physical therapy session i did some aerobic work as well so that may be why i have to get labs done tomorrow for my pnurse and this probably wont help my blood glucose any my daughter went to our community mental health center to make an initial appt for her depression and anxiety they told her to come back as a walkin and she panicked i managed to calm her down and made a plan for next wednesday in case she wants support from us she could call as well but she has bad phone phobia as well its amazing how i can be so calm for my family while the inside of me is churning like a tornado i am in good space right now husband now has pinkeye as well as a sinus infection plus a fungal rash on his leg poor guy did get some homework done before i take my first exam i have 4 exams plus the final my professor is allowing us to work ahead so ill do that also picked up my meds and got labs done feeling pretty calm with a bit of background worry for my hubby my anxiety has been on and off today its been one of thiose days where im okay for a while then get anxious over nothing in particular then ill be fine again and so on i hate when i get anxious over nothing it always makes me confused i mean how can you be anxious over something if you dont know whats making you anxious lets face it anxiety is weird we panic over weird things what i want to know for the sheer reason of community and not feeling alone is what is the weirdest thing youve had an anxiety or panic attack about mine was a menu that could be vaguely confusing even though i understood it the weirdest feeling for me is being on a med that stops the physical symptoms of anxiety and i feel great but when i have too much time to sit and think i start panicking in my mind and thinking omg maybe im dying because my heart isnt racing then i start breathing all weird basically panicking about not having a panic attack i feel overwhelmed by all the phone calls i have to do on tuesday all kinds of things are happening the wrong way i hope i can clear it all up im dreading it being touched on the face by a flower im alergic to wasps and it really got me i had a panic attack that lasted forever the voices in my head were screaming i was totally breathless i was frozen to the spot it was horrible the person looked at me like id lost my ing mind and started shouting what are you doing its a cute yellow flower its lovely but i think by that time they may as well be talking to the flower theyd have got more of a response the other weirdest time was when i got diffrent shaped chips fries of course i thought theyd not taste the same they had poison in them they had been cooked wrong and their i went again that time i even got a really bad pain in my kneck phantom pain that is or that time i totally flipped over the factt i was missing my wwe wrestling and took to sending threatening messages to random people give my wrestling to me or else only to find out 20 minits later that the wrestling that week was on a saturday not a friday embarrassed much and then i pannicked again because wrestling falls on fridays in england not saturdays my husband was 15 minutes late getting home i mean really i thought he was dead lol silliest thing was i checked out of a nice hotel because they kept playing the same three songs on a sound track total meltdown making dinner and it wasnt that hard of a recipe i just couldnt do it thankfully my husband did being on facebook i deactivate my account all the time when anxiety gets me its frustrating doing laundry got some stuff for the hubby and finished one of my exams for school chilling out with some spa music at the moment it was strange i was doing the exam and my daughter was talking about one of her friends who was being dragged along by a narcissist at least she realized that she didnt want to deal with the drama and wants to arrange a game group without the offending people around she has such a big heart and it hurts sometimes but im proud of her as well read some info about what i was worrying about i dont know if it will happen i hope not got him to pick up a multivitamin to go with his everexpanding group of meds hope it will help without having a ms flare im doing okay at the moment i woke up anxious and had to take my prn i tend to get both done when im like this something happened that i thought would make me feel better did but it was shortlived and im anxious about that too its frustrating what my mind does to me have a sinus headache other than that im okay sigh i was so ready to talk to the therapist today she didnt show up to the appointmentshe forgot to put me on the calendar i have work anxiety creeping in on me again evenings are good because i take my meds then was a tough day back at work we lost a 6yearold boy in the er cant get the moms face out of my head when i had to tell her the news my daughter always seems to know when this happens must be how hard i hugged her when i got home high anxiety this evening after someone knocked on back door and said sorry wrong house on high alert i was watching street  spotted someone walking down the middle same person only this time he had a sock hat on i asked if he found right house  he walks to porch to tell me he lost his phone batterywhich was a lie because i could see phone display was lit i told him not to come back to this house waited for neighbor to get home  told him so his wife  daughter would be alert fortunately theres a lot of dogs in the neighborhood im getting porch light repaired tomorrow for the back entrance we use to come  go hugs to those that want them health anxiety is up i strained my back in aqua therapy i also have almost all of my blood test results and more of them are slightly off though one that was typically high has returned to normal i have some ideas as to the cause but my doc is still on maternity leave and i dont know when shell be back my pnurse may also have something to say but thats not until next week ill keep off dr google and hope to have something later otherwise im doing okay i like mindscom i call it not facebook because it is a truly uncensored site except of course for illegal posts my friends relationship problems i worry a lot about how his relationship is going the anxiety of worrying i may slip on the ice and either look like an idiot or seriously hurt myself is unbearable i have boot krampons to prevent this yet it is all that i think about when out of doors i have this thing about not wanting any family members and espeacially any of brothers to tickle me the idea of it happening makes my skin crawl i think that in part it is because of my knismolagnia so tickling is something very personal to me and being put through a situation like that would feel like a form of molestation to me i even had to word that last sentence a certain way on the count of these feelings i get anxious my wisdom teeth are going to somehow grow back thought i was going to have a heart attack in a work meeting that included a room full of physicians my heart was beating so fast i could see my shirt moving and i could hear it in my ears my only thought was well if i have a heart attack i guess im in a good place to have it  i remember getting really nervous while making a smoothie one day i have a super weird fear that the blender is going to explode when it turns on i still quite havent conquered that fear yet  using the toaster i always think its going to catch fire even if its unplugged taking medicine for anxiety when i was first given vistaril i had an anxiety attack about taking it my other weird one is being in a car right now my mind keeps telling me i am going to be an accident so i have pretty much refused to get in a car unless i absolutely have to i am so tired of the rollercoaster i had lots of anxiety on monday and was fairly calm yesterday im back to feeling the anxiety today i wish i could figure out what was different about yesterday first appointment with a new therapist friday im already nervous about it a couple of times ive had near panic attacks when i suddenly realized i forgot to say thank you to strangers for small nice things they did like moving to one side on a narrow footpath so i could pass for instance what an awful horrible person i am i need to scour the earth searching for that stranger to explain why i forgot to say thank you i hope they will forgive me i mean its ridiculous really i got nervous going to the store for some reason im still not sure why i was nervous in the first place lol it was the only time i ever felt nervous going somewhere i dont experience anxiety though i merely get some butterflies in my stomach and maybe a twitch i was scared that i was the only real being in the universe once 2 words that make me really anxious for some reason i seem to associate them with abuse please especially like please just ing do it or else the reason why im posting this is because i want to know how i can look normal when people say those words to me everytime someone says please or thank you i tend to cringe and then shiver and people look at me waaaaa but those are good positive words i dont want that reaction but its hard because of the association i have i hate please too my mother never used it except very coercively it was never like set the table please more like please change the course of your life so i can win this argument thats how i feel with i love you yea ok sure you do you dont hurt people you love my guess is maybe with time you might just react less but feel the same or with therapy maybe you will feel less negativity associated with them its something people say to get you to do what they want or to patch up after something bad happened in my opinion not many say i love you and actually mean it its a tool manipulators use i get very anxious when a family member of mine gets sicki am even too nervous to call the doctor or take them to the hospital does anyone else feel like this and how do you overcome this i recently started noticing  im not sure if its my anxiety i was eating a pancake and i started getting tingling all over i drank some hawaiian punch almost the same thing only i felt lightheaded i never had a problem with sugar before but i just wonder if its the medication i take paxil i have had glucose tests and they are normal but i just wonder if the medication is somehow messing my anxiety hmmmmm sugar is devils poop it is really bad for you i gradually tapered the sugar off started w no sugar in coffee then decreased and afterwards eliminated alcohol no soda no juice cut desert to one meal a week etc and i have to admit that it has had noticeable benefits reduced anxiety still heavy but not as intense increased concentration less foggy brain less depressed less fatigue the annoying part is that i feel much worse if i eat my favorite dessert but i also love it so i do eat my desert and suffer afterwards it is pretty silly its weird sugar never seemed to bother me but slowly it did i guess things just happen as strange as that sounds i do need to be less anxious so cutting out sugar is the best as my pdoc always said  along with caffeine even if im struggling to stay awake i miss my mountain dews though i sure do they told me to come back friday for a second interview so i think thats good i walked 8 miles today and cooked dinner for my family cleaned my room this is a good day i am not sure where it comes from and only this morning realised that these are linked to my anxietydepression but i sometimes have major rage outbursts i smash things up and shout and swear it can often seem like its over nothing for example someone looked at something in my work the other day and i thought they were judging me for putting it there so i went off in a rage shouting and swearing at the top of my lungs i later realised i had misjudged the situation and seriously overreacted previous times i have just felt unable to cope so thrown things and kicked stuff to smash them up like an uncontrollable kid having a tantrum usually noone is around but if there is they go silent and dont know what to do i think i scare people i know if my pet is around i scare them because they shake in their bed and wont come near me even though i am not shouting at them or hurting them in any way this makes me feel so bad and snap out of the outburst when i see them shaking and scared i dont want to do that to them i am already on meds for the anxiety attacks i used to get evety morning and this has helped a lot i am thinking of seeing my doc about this any advice i would discuss it with the doc maybe the meds are even bringing this on thanks but i have been having it since i was young and not on meds thanks for the response a family member of mine was said to have a rage disorder hed fly off the handle over anything i developed rage like you describe over one specific really big issue in my life id def discuss it with your doc though there are meds for it but i havent taken them hi i feel for you to be honest because the whole angerrage thing isnt really your fault its just the way it is for you but i have struggles along similar lines as well what i try to do is really stay aware of my emotions and feelings and watch what thoughts im latching onto and just try to let go of anything that might lead me toward an undesirable outburst scenario i havent perfected it but its definitely helping self awareness hang in there itsjustmehere its all a journey of inner growth hi all so i had a job interview today at a dog place the woman asked me reasons i wanted to work there besides dogs so i said to try and socialize more and she asked if i struggled with that i said well i can talk to people but it makes me a bit anxious sometimes then it got weird she proceeded to ask me things like are you taking any medications for that are you seeking professional help how long have you been seeing someone for it how long do you plan to is this why you need a certain time off each week does your therapist know you came here for this etc i answered out of pressure and being unsure of what to saydo but now i feel so violated she wrote it all down was this inappropriate or am i overreacting asking you how long you plan to see a therpist and pretty much all those other questions seem very odd to ask during an interview i cant say wether it was inappropriate or not but certainly unnecessary and uncomfortable i am socially shy and anxious at times and would personally be offended if she jumped straight to asking me if im getting help taking meds etc if i said i wanted the chance to improve my social skills i personally avoid talking about my social skills good or bad as much as possible at interviews because my fear that it would become problematic to tell a hiring manager that i have good social skills would be a lie they would come to realize later lol but to say i needed to work on it would make me feel that will give the employer some preconcieved notions about my socialability that would probably be wrong or even damaging to my chances because its not a black or white matter but some people treat it that way that being said being honest is not bad but there are sometimes implications to that kind of honestly wording is key to say you want to advance your social skills in the work place is good but i would avoid the word anxious or anxiety the last time i told a professional i had anxiety was at a blood donor place result had to get a written approval to donate from my therapist which i told her i did not see anymore and just quit taking the med i listed it was my last refill and was empty but it was still in my system since it was so recent so thats why i added it to my med list the nurse wouldnt listen i contacted the therapist and told her this and she said she would not do it since i dont actually take that med anymore i explained this to the nurse again and she refused to let me donate im pretty sure that was not really legal mind you my sister was with me and went in first with this nurse when she spoke with that nurse she told her she was taking that medication same as me too but did not mention anxiety to the woman like i did so she got to go right ahead and donate anyway i would say you or not overreacting the questions were way too much considering the original comment could be summed up to wanting more social opportunities if you are in the us then all of those questions were illegal and you need to report it asking about medical questions which those qualify as and your treatment is very specifically illegal contact your local eeoc office and report her tell them you felt forced to answer or you wouldnt get the job you may want to consult with a lawyer also i cannot believe she asked those questions i have hired people before and you cannot ask those questions like no freaking way i cannot believe she asked you those questions so very illegal blatantly i would write it all down so you dont forget any of it right now and contact the eeoc office closest to you asap to file a complaint you have a pretty easy lawsuit there fyi seesaw yes those questions were way out of line at the same time i would never say im interested in a job to work on my social skills in an interview a job isnt therapy and if social skills are important for the job the employer wont want someone who says they want to improve those definitely not okay the most she could have said and this still may not be appropriate thank you for being honest with me i hope you are addressing the issue and then move on with the interview on the other hand i have to ask did you do or say anything that could have triggered her to ask these questions in other words is there anything else that you didnt share in your post that we should know in order to evaluate the situation accordingly her questions were definitely inappropriate but i hope this will serve as a lesson for future interviews to never answer with to socialize more in response to why you want to work somewhere remember you are not at work to socialize but to work i wish you all the best in future job interviews oh im so glad you both like this i think it is so great there are many other videos so far i really like repeating this one um ill say it again her questions were more than out of line they were illegal also her stance on refusing a service dog was illegal even though you dont have one i seriously would file a complaint with your regional eeoc office she is not allowed by law to ask you questions regarding your medical history nor to outright deny a service dog without considering a request for reasonable accommodation and making the case that it would cause her undue hardship i hope you will follow through with the complaint because she sounds like an abusive employer at the least if shes already breaking the law through her hiring practices seesaw this is from shrm the biggest resource on hr law since your medications have nothing to do with the position you were applying for like being a police officer or operating heavy machinery her inquiry violated the ada which does protect you here regardless if you are disabled or not here is a link describing such certainly these areas can be grey areas which is why you should file a complaint with the eeoc it does not cost anything file a complaint you do not need a lawyer to do so if the eeoc finds there was a violation then the employer would be fined employers break these rules all the time and i think its very important to report this stuff otherwise they continue to abuse people with disabilities seesaw does anyone find that when you are feeling very anxious you get more done i find this myself when i may shake with fear at confronting certain situations but i am also very very productive at these times i guess there is a good side to anxiety my anxiety is especially high at the moment as i have been off my meds for a few days when people approach me and start a conversation i shake but these last few days i have really been stepping my work up a notch and organising my life in a very positive way i am confused as i dont know if this is good if i do physical labor i get more done with mental work not so much default management and coping skills for anxiety panic and ptsd here are some of the coping skills i learned for managing anxiety and found to work well for stress and ptsd i hope you find some of them useful  i have posted these before but am bringing them together and up to date and adding the dbt selfsoothing skills that also help either before or after a panic self comforting skills we are social creatures but getting what we need when we need it from another is not always available here are some of the suggestions from the dbt handbook on self soothing skills think of soothing each of your five senses 1 vision notice what you see find soothing things to look at i go to a blog that has lovely pictures c ptsd  a way out  a place to check in daily  2 hearing pay attention to what you can hear around you put on your favorite music 3 smell be aware of the memories that smell can bring i like to do aroma therapy there are many essential oils for that 4 taste carefully savor flavors that the day brings you keep a favorite hard candy on hand for the little sugar boost too 5 touch find comfort in touch keep a special pillow or blanket with a favorite perfume on it dialectical behavioral therapydistress tolerance skillsselfsoothing  wikibooks open books for an open world these are not listed but i find them handy too a reassurance tell yourself that you are ok safe and unharmed the danger is past you have survived this before and now you are stronger and more skillful than then b take action go for a walk or exercise or clean house or cook use your bodys natural focusing powers to leave the fear behind c refocus think about pleasant things push the hurtful thoughts away have a hobby or a story or a book that you like to take your mind to a better place coping with anxiety and panic 1 remember feelings of panic are just exaggerations of normal bodily stress reactions 2 sensations are neither harmful nor dangerous  just unpleasant nothing worse will happen 3 anxiety is temporary instead of fighting it relax into it just let it be 4 focus on facing the fear rather than trying to avoid it or escape from it 5 stop adding to the panic with frightening thoughts of where panic will lead 6 stay in the present be aware of what is happening to you rather than concern yourself with how much worse it might get 7 notice that when you stop adding to panic with frightening thoughts the fear begins to fade 8 wait and give the fear time to pass 9 look around you plan what you will do next as the panic subsides 10 when you are ready to go on do so in an easy relaxed manner there is no hurry 11 think about the progress made so far despite all the difficulties some specific actions 1 manage your breathing if it is rapid breathe into a paper sack to lower oxygen uptake 2 count your breaths 1001 1002 1003 ect up to 1020 then start again slow down the count to slow your heartbeat counting interferes with anxiety 3 delay doing anything about your anxiety or panic just follow the steps and focus on getting thru it 4 distract yourself with anything that requires you to focus and is simple and handy  at home you might read something easy like a magazine or knit or wash dishes whatever engages your attention 5 eat something to replenish the blood sugars that adrenalin has burned up and give yourself at least 15 minutes for the kidneys to clean out the ashes in your blood 6 write these things down and keep them with you until you have made them a habit practice these skills before you need them or when you are just mildly anxious so they will be familiar when you are feeling very upset i hope you find this information helpful best wishes gus this is a good thread and would probably benifit from being a sticky here i dont actually know if we have a sticky in the anxiety section for methods someone told me recently that one way to help with anxiety is to suck on a humbug not suck on a sweet it has to be a humbug why i dont know but i tried this and it did work to help calm a panic attack i was having so now i ordered a huge bag full i just got the email today of my orientation date for an internship i applied for i have had a real problem with this all my life i will decide i want to do something a job volunteer school etc and back out at the last minute or worse quit midday and escape home i remember when i was like 7 years old i wanted to do gymnastics so bad i begged my mom to sign me up for it and she somehow managed to scrape together some money when i got there i went into the gym and freaked at the sight of all the kids bouncing around having fun i went and hid in the bathroom my mom had not even left yet and then i proceeded to beg her to take me home she was so mad and confused at my behavior i have managed to push myself to do some things but when i wanted to join ballet i was already 14 years old and felt much more comfortable in the adult class and that was how i was able to ease into that i did that for 10 years despite being self conscious about my body i even worked there for free lessons i did quit a few times though but returned after a few months break ive done this with a job i felt particularly comfortable with too i had gone through the horrible discomfort of starting that job but often felt like i could do something more so in a depressed and anxious mood i wouldnt go into work they would take me back 6 months later probably because it was retail and i was a good employee except for my little episodes they took me back 3 times over 7 years i finally quit for good 6 years ago and tried 2 other jobs one where i worked at home i ended up going back to school and only finished because it was online then i felt really ambitious and decided it would be a good idea to apply for a 3 month internship where i will go from no job at all to working 40 hours a week doing very physical labor getting up at 530am and having a long commute i have been so isolated out of shape and have really poor sleeping habits this feels like my last chance at having some sort of life im already midthirties with no kids never married i need something in my life but am too scared to go through with this the extreme shift in routine will be a shock to me and i dont know if ill be able to handle it i feel like i will blow this opportunity and am kicking myself that i didnt apply for something more pt first will i ever learn not to ignore my limits i dont want to burn bridges at this place because my plan for years was to eventually work there actually i have oscillated about really wanting this as a career too maybe because of the anxiety but maybe because of something else i dont know i have already started thinking of excuses to back out though i have 2 weeks to mull this over until it will probably turn into nothingness once again and i will be back where i started oh and the financial mess this behavior has left is growing as well even though i was lucky in a way to inherit a little money when my dad died i now have a giant student loan so really cant mess around anymore it has also done a number on my self esteem and dignity i cant count the times ive done this too and like you wasted a lot of money in the process i remember the last time i was so stuck for excuses i just came up with well it was rainingg so i couldnt do it it was inside so like that worked hugs i dont know if you meant to do it but i laughed a little your response was kind of funny thank you i needed that at least you have a sense of humor over it usually i do too but get so wrapped up the feelings sometimes thanks for sharing this it is interesting how caught up we can become in tv programs i was severely bullied throughout high school and to this day i have great difficulty watching any program that involves someone being bullied or threatened in any way programs that involve hostagetaking are an absolute dontwatch for me on the other hand one of the things ive struggled with my entire life is gender identity disorder theres one program in the inspector lewis series shown on our local public television station that concerns a character who was a maletofemale transsexual as it turns out that character is the villain in the program still i love watching that segment every time it is replayed i dont want to leave the house i dont even want to leave my room i just want to stay here wrapped up in a blanket well im about to quit after 2 days in i am so weird and so tired of myself there are some people who might be considered weird right away but i appear normal to most people when they first meet me in fact i can even appear quite confident my problem is that once i am expected to loosen up after introductions or whatever i get real quiet people must think i am stuck up or dont like them or something no i am just really self conscious i dont know what to say the first day is fine because i can ask questions but when it comes to the little banter and joking around i just dont find it funny but get so exhausted fake laughing or smiling of course i do it though to be polite then people start talking about their husband or kids or vacations i just cant relate i am a weirdo who never got married or had kids and have always been too poor to travel i also didnt go straight from high school to college i went on and off for years trying different things it doesnt look good i wish i could just say that and then add that i only settle for inconsiderate guys who dont care about me at least i wouldnt have to fake being normal i cant even stand it anymore isnt there anyone like me im starting to think i have some sort of disorder where i am two different people one day i like certain things and the next day i am indifferent to the same thing my mood is usually different too and it is totally uncontrollable there doesnt seem to be anything that can bring me out of the mood ive been seeing a therapist in training and when i mentioned this to her she sort of ignored it i feel like im probably one of those people who need a different kind of help but am slipping through the cracks then that just confirms my thoughts about being too worthless for any therapist or doctor to care about i swear i just dont know why people go into certain professions no one seems to really care it just seems like they had to pick something as a career and are fulfilling their own selfish ambitions instead of genuinely wanting to help having horrible thoughts today i dont know anymore ok so its been a while since ive been on herein the past few months ive experienced my verbally and sometimes physical abusive sister having a baby moving out  a failed relationship with a much older man and almost attacked by a acquaintance im now in a great relationship with a wonderful man and now that my sister is gone the house is peaceful  the problem is im still the flight or fight mode and cant sleep very well just looking for support and suggestions thanks  its nice to see you back  in a great relationship as im sure youre aware it can take time to get over the types of experiences youve had in the past hopefully as time passes so will your anxiety here are links to 3 articles from psychcentrals archives on the subject of healing from trauma perhaps something in them may be of some help with putting your own experiences to rest so i need to quit my job ive been back and forth on this for months i feel a lot of guilt over quitting at the same time i dread my job every day i dont enjoy it anymore its too timeconsuming and i cant devote enough time to myself or to school i have an hour long commute and i hate it i never get enough sleep im exhausted and just done the thing is im basically a babysitter i get to the house in the early am get the kids ready for school then take them to school i have a brief break while theyre there during which time i go back to their empty house too long a commute to go back to my own then i pick them up from school and keep them until the end of their single moms workday used to be they would come home and take a nap and i could do homework now though one of themnis in therapy every day after school so we drive 45 minutes to therapy sit there for 2 hours and drive 45 minutes back coupled with my commute a lot of driving the mom also got them a puppy for xmas which she wants me to take care of while the kids are in school im allergic to the pup so thats frustrating the mom has also been getting home later and later until my workday has consistently stretched more than an hour longer each day i need a bit of a break and im looking for workfromhome jobs the thing is i have so much anxiety over quitting i mean shes a single mom one of her kids just started therapy ive been teaching the other to read they just got a puppy shes been having a hard time at work ive been with them over a year my initial agreement with her was to work for her for a year the second that year was up she started begging me not to quit she raised my pay by a dollar an hour i feel like shes done as much as she can to keep me but i just dont want to be here anymore but im scared to tell her ugh i just got my degree and im in graduate school now i want work experience that isnt babysitting im super terrified of confrontation though any advice would help well i dont know as there is much of anything in the way of advice i can offer from my perspective this is just one of those situations that is what it is yes it may be difficult for the mom when you leave but you dont owe her your life your circumstances have changed  its time to for you to move on thats it there shouldnt be any confrontation involved with this but of course what there should be  what there will be may be two different things i think all you can do is to tell your employer straight out your circumstances have changed  its time for you to move on try to give her a reasonable amount of notice if you feel you can so that she can do whatever she needs to do to find someone to replace you but beyond that you have your own life to live and its become time for you to get on with it youre right and i can hear the rationality of it but theres a major part of my brain that is terrified of anyone being angry or upset with me i seriously cant deal with it a friend once texted me we need to talk mutual friend is mad at you and i got so panicked about it that i vomited im so scared of telling this mom that i want to quit that i start shaking whenever i think of it and every time she makes a little comment about not wanting me to quit or that i should leave grad school and just be her nanny or whatever i get nauseous its really intense anxiety the weird thing is in situations like this im inclined to lie it feels like if i tell a story to justify my quitting likejake and i are pregnant he wants me to stay home anything to deflect from the fact that i simply want to quit its easier to take it if they get upset because i know theyre mad at something that isnt even true not at just me im usually a very honest person its only in this type of very specific situation that i suddenly cant deal with it and feel the urge to lie its very strange i know this is probably weird but i have mild anxiety about female contestants going on quiz shows it usually works out something like this ill watch the introduction of the quiz show and see who the contestants are then if theirs a female contestant on the show either ill turn off the quiz and watch something else or on a good day ill keep it on in the background but do something else i dont know why this is and its not always last week their was a female contestant on the chase and i was able to watch that without turning it off i have also watched female contestants play a detective quiz i like but on high anxiety days i just cant cope with females on quiz shows i even panic i had a pretty big win against my anxiety over the weekend i am good i am happy to hear you turn off the show you have indicated a problem with female contestants and your comfort zone i wonder if you also have a problem with quiz shows themselves can you find an alternative just dont watch them in the first place i have my own problem with any kind of reality tv programming i just cant bear to see people behave badly and humiliate themselves publicly so i dont even try to watch them i turn the tv off instead i did it again this week and you know what was sad i really wanted to watch it new quiz called the wave where teams of 2 have to work together to try and win thousands of pounds the presenter announced so today their is a mother and daughter playing the game and i turned it off ugg and i wanted to see it too its okay the following night i tuned in to the wave again and the couple were males so could watch it this is an anxiety that has plagued me since early childhood and i think that it dates back to the first grade when i was in the first grade there was a girl in my class that i was very visually attracted to i put it that way because i basically knew nothing about her other than that she was very pretty to my child eyes so like any little kid with a crush i started writing love letters to her but after reading them she would look right at me and tear them up the emotional pain from that was overwhelming to me even as a young child to make matters worse she later began to bully me by popping me with her comb that was emotionally painful too i dont know which stung worse the comb on my tender flesh or the sting of persecution to my heart even so i continued to want her to be my girlfriend but knew deep inside that that would never happen eventually my family packed up and moved to south carolina and for a long time i had no interest in other girls as i still dreamed of that one eventually in time i began to forget about her and just let it go but my interests in other girls didnt start up again until maybe the fith or sixth grade and this was for yet another who didnt return my affections and seemed to resent me the next year it was the same thing with a different girl and again the year after that i believe that after that was when i truly gave up oh sure as a teenager i still fancied other girls throughout jr high school but dared not approach them save for one who was really cool but we would just talk on the bus as she wasnt in any of my classes but i could never work up the nerve to try to take it any further than that by saying something complimentary like hey ashley youre really pretty you know that or ashley youre so cool so by that point in life or really by the sixth grade i could no longer tell pretty girls what i thought of them and i am still intimidated by attractive women to this day even when i do work up the nerve to talk to one which is very rarely i screw it up by not thinking it through enough first and when it doesnt work out i become super depressed and anxious about having no future that really matters and go buy some beer to calm my nerves even though i dont drink that much after that i feel a little better but still hurt inside so that is one of my biggest if not the biggest anxiety that i have i didnt mean for this post to be so long i guess i just had to get this off of my chest as it has tormented me for many years im so sorry youve had these experiences you are very strong as you havent given up yet have you considered processing some of this in therapy or through journaling sending big hugs hi all i am starburstowl26 and i have been having a lot of anxiety like a lot i am on a med to treat it but i find myself taking it every single day new years eve was super hard for me because i dont like loud noises i took my medicine but i still had a small panic attack when the grand finale went off at midnight also having a hard time going to stores anymore because i start practically hyperventilating the second i step out of the car i havent had anxiety issues this bad since i was like 17 and i am 28 now i have no clue what triggered it either i had a hysterectomy in august that brought on a depression but cant seem to figure out where the anxiety is coming from sigh well anxiety is certainly something ive been familiar with for many years decades really i dont know as i can really offer much in the way of insight as far as why or how it develops but here are links to a couple of articles from psychcentrals archives on the subject i have bad anxiety when someone is angry or shouts this is becoming a problem as soon as someone gets angry it doesnt have to be at me i am anxious of them and refuse to have anything more to do with them and im very anxious around them at first i thought this was because of my history of childhood abuse but now i dont think so i think it goes beyond that and i know i need to stop this we all get angry from time to time and if i got anxious of every single person who ever got angry theird be no one left i actually have not been to one i talked to my therapist about it and he says that for anxiety residential programs dont really do any good because after the person leaves treatment then they still have to face whatever anxiety they were facing before treatment thank you for sharing this i feel this way too i definitely avoid confrontation and will sometimes act more cheerful just to avoid the possibility of confrontation although youre right that we all get angry from time to time it sounds like you also want a gentler world am i reading right if so i think what youre saying totally makes sense and that theres nothing wrong with your response sending good wishes for a gentle day today im the exact same way but i think does have to do with my childhood every time somebody was angry when i was little it lead to physical violence so i always get scared thats going to happen i avoid arguing as much as possible and cant stand to see fights happen i always want to run and hide i am the same way i strongly dislike myself for being like a spunge even if someone is doing an anxious or an angry facial tic or expression i feel it in my stomach annoying same goes for angry emails news articles online comments my brain exaggerates them i get really scared and immediately get anxiety my only coping mechanism has been to ignore and escape which probably is not the wisest way to deal with the situation well i also go to therapy for the reasons that make my brain react that way but it has not really helped im sorry you are having this difficulty i have this challenge in certain situations and it causes panic attacks so bad i cant begin to address the situation have you thought about processing this with a therapist sending big hugs i know mine comes from childhood abuse there are better ways to get ones point across besides shouting though its mostly conditioning my daughters boyfriends family tends to shout a lot at each other but i saw them at thanksgiving and it wasnt too bad i think they were probably forewarned the one that does it the most hid in the home office most of the time i was wondering if anybody has problems with physical symptoms of anxiety after illnesses like the flu or colds all the time i have health anxiety so i always worry that something is worse than what it is im reassured that its nothing but my anxiety and nothing is physically wrong with me absolutely i am pretty much over a stomach bug but i am struggling to go back to eating normal foods because i have bad emetophobia fear of vomiting baby steps i suppose can any of you share what trickstools you use to distract your ruminating thoughts im having a bit of a struggle with mine ive been reading some things online and came across some things that resonated with me the less we fight against that which is disturbing us the less disturbing these experiences become the fear of experiencing significant anxietydepression  emotional phobia we feel bad for feeling bad what works for you when you start to ruminate anyone else have to deal with this i used to be very confused by it even though i know its pretty common because my job is very low stress and i like my coworkers but i think its just dreading having so little time for myself and feeling like i didnt do everything i had planned on doing on the weekend both chores and fun stuff ive been wanting to go ice skating for the past 6 weekends but id have to go at 9 am because later theres too many kids on the ice and its chaos i feel like theres way too much on my to do list and i dont have much energy to do stuff after work plus i have yoga once or twice a week and class once after work the other two nights i have to do grocery shopping and cook for two days basically im already looking forward to friday and the upcoming week being over when it hasnt even started yet  the biggest problem with that is that i dont sleep very well on sunday night and then i start the week being exhausted and because i have to get up extra early on monday morning i feel like any time i take to relax stresses me more because i should be in bed already i have an early morning anyone have any tips well i dont know as i have any particularly useful tips to offer im pretty sure anything i could think of you already know about but i can certainly relate to what you wrote without going into a lot of detail ill just say that for many years decades really sunday night anxiety was something that haunted me im a senior citizen now and i havent been employed for quite a few years but i still feel some remnants of that old sunday night anxiety i think after so many years of it its so ingrained i still cant quite let it all go feeling anxiety today over a few things progressed to a panic attack drastically reduced my benzodiazepines at my own request wondering if that is causing the problem or if im just expecting too much out of myself whatever it is i really dislike it one thing i do is to practice compassionate abiding in case youre not familiar with this practice heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice the other thing i do is ive learned a few mantras and when i begin to ruminate  find im having difficulty stopping ill chant these mantras theyre all in languages i dont speak  personally i find that to be a plus if youre not familiar with mantras youtube is a great place to find many thanks skeesyks i read that link from a post where you recommended it to someone else thats where the quotes i posted were from my worst times are early morning sometimes an hour or two before i need to get up then i worry the whole day will go that way ugh ill youtube mantras thanks this was once a problem cbt helped a great deal one thing i find makes it worse is to write about my thoughts no journalling no blogging i hear you the sunday blues are very real i start getting that feeling of dread around 3pm on sunday i read somewhere that it helps to have something fun planned on sunday like working out going to the movies etc that way you have something to look forward to instead of just focusing on the upcoming week i always say ill do that then never follow through if anything i spend sunday preparing like doing laundry grocery shopping checking my work schedule blech hugs to you all i am more afraid that people will abuse me rather than the people themselves the first question i ask myself when i meet someone new is will this person be abusive towards me thats what happens when youve had a ed up childhood a therapist one time told me that when i found myself ruminating to just say stop works better when i am alone or in a car i am also keeping track by the hour whether anything i fear has happened so far for about 5 days i only had one hour where my fear and it was not a serious one came true i am beginning to see that i am wasting a lot of time worrying i distract myself with hobbies video games movies anything superhero find a go to hobby and do it when the thoughts start circulating about in your head i have anxiety dropping or picking up my kid from school  i can take the kid to stores and stuff without much frightanyone else feel this did you feel anxiety going to school when you were a kid when i see kids waiting for a school bus i feel a little anxious i think i relate it to my childhood and fear i had around going to school at times and trouble i experienced riding the bus i was just wondering if anyone could help me with a dilemma i am having i want to start journalling ive noticed recently that my state of mind can alter dramatically throughout the day from the depths of despair to being ok i also have times when i have thoughts  or at least i think they are thoughts  but which at the time i think are real  then later when im trying to recall those thoughts or whatever they are and i cant anyway i keep thinking  particularly when im feeling bad  that i should go  see my gp but by the time i get an appointment even if its the same day i will probably feel better  either cancel or not be able to explain myself because of all of the above i thought that journalling would help me capture how im feeling in that moment  then i could take it with me to my gp the issue im having i dont know how to keep my journal if i keep it on paper format i live in fear of it being discovered  read by my family  if its going to work i need to be honest in what i write i dont want them to see it if i keep it on the notes section of my phone which feels like the safest place  im afraid of the data being lost  i dont know whether the gp will find it as easy to read all of this is bothering me  i feel mithered  undecided  then i become anxious just typing this is giving me palpitations im having the same issue with lists im trying write a to do list but i want it in a format that i can keep with the date next to the items as i do them so i can see how much or how little im accomplishing so it needs to be in a book or a pad where the pages dont come outand then i cant decide whether the things to do should be on the same page or in the same book as things to buy  what about my aims for 2018 should they have a separate page or book if i do them separately i end up with multiple books or parts of a book to keep checking  looking at  keep safe  again it just all becomes overwhelming im eally struggling with any kind of motivation to do anything at the moment i find no joy in anything i cant seem to think of anything i actually want to do so i just keep doing things other people are doing in the hopeactually i dont knowin the hope that ill stop feeling so lost sorry this post has kind of morphed im not even sure its in the right forum now desperation any help at all would be most appreciated thank you thank you both for taking the time to reply i hadnt thought about just doing some brief notes i will try that maybe it will be enough to jog my memory thank you and as daft as this may sound i didnt know there were such things as online journals thank you that could work i feel a bit calmer today sometimes i read my original posts  its like a different person has written them which i guess comes from the rapid changes in how i feel during anyone day thank you have you been journaling how has it been going some people keep a day book with everything in one bookthoughtsideasgoalslists sounds messy but i may try it because i have too many separate books to keep track of and its a pain if you keep a hard copy journal only use initials or even your own code names so if it is found others wont find it so interesting most people dont care about reading someones journal unless they are in it i always disguise people places and events so that i can carry a proper journal i think now i may start a day book good luck thanks for the word mitheredi never heard of it and so had to look it up its a great word i wanted to add this tipi perk up my journals by pasting in photos and cutouts i use stickers sometimes i draw in them i did this in order to be a little more creativeand when i go back to old journals it is fun to see art work and poetry etc i also record quotes that i like from other sources things to help me in my journey thats where im at i think i dont want a diary i want to record my feelings  thought processes which i can never recall after the event in the hope as you have to gain some kind of insight  understanding of myself how you describe your workbooks makes perfect sense to me and if we invent some words along the way all the better i love the idea of adding pictures  quotes when im low i quite often spend a ridiculous amount of time searching quotes on the internet there is often a picture or a quote that captures what im trying to verbalise and cant thats a great idea  will really help with getting a true picture of that day or time from one journaler to another  thank you my best friend in middlehigh school did that i witnessed it a few times at slumber parties we talked about it many years later we all thought she was faking to try to freak us out or to be funny no it was real she has dissociative disorder and ptsd i really cant say what happened to her because it is too triggering of course you should see a therapist and psychiatrist to diagnose your symptoms hi i have bpii i have had gad in the past but dont really have too many problems with that anymore that said i got overly exhausted in middecember with being sick and work and a lot of responsibilities and not enough sleep i boarded a flight to visit my family for xmast very early in the morning totally exhausted i had to transfer flights and on my second flight i almost nodded off but jolted awake suddenly before the plane took off and i had this feeling of being unable to access myself being separate from myself it was the most unsettling thing i have ever experienced it wouldnt go away i tried breathing exercises putting my head down closing my eyes nothing helped nothing would shake the feeling that something wasnt right that i was outside of myself in a way finally i got out of my seat to get a klonopin out of my bag i have them in case i need them but hardly ever take them i chewed it to make it work faster and fell asleep when i awoke the feeling was gone the next day i had another episode like that while in the shower it lasted the rest of the day and made me very anxious but was less intense than the one i had on the plane what is this is it panic well im certainly no expert but based on what you wrote i would say yes this certainly sounds to me like a panic attack here are links to 6 articles from psychcentrals archives on the subject of panic attacks i think pretty much every parents worse fear is something happening to their child i know i will never rid myself of that fear but im struggling with it these days i have one child an 18 month old daughter after i gave birth i developed a really bad fear she would die from sids i got a breathing monitor and it really helped until she was older and past the sids danger zones i dont let my fear get in the way of living our lives i let her go to daycare i let my mom babysit her etc but those intrusive thoughts come into my mind numerous times a day where i worry about having to live my life without her in it what if we get in a car accident what if my mom is taking care of her and she takes off and gets hit by a car sometimes the thoughts just pop in when im driving and i visualize in my mind her running out on the road and getting hit by a car its not minor things i worry about its death i have always struggled with a fear of deathfor both myself and those i love i used to have the same fears with my dog and had the same intrusive thoughts aside from anxiety i have boarderline personality disorder and i think its part of the fear of abandonment or something i have asked it in here as it feels more like anxiety i am not on medication anymore and i dont see a therapist right now i need to get this under control though my mom wants to take my daughter one day during the week to visit my brothers family and its a lot of freeway driving to get there why does my brain instantly go to them getting in a catastrophic accident or my daughter running off and my mom not being able to catch her if i heard someone else worrying like this id think they are crazy are there any books or resources on this anyone have any techniques in how to deal with it i try to recognize the thoughts name them and say how they are making me feel but it just doesnt seem to get better thank you im sorry you are struggling with these difficult thoughts i cant be of any help with regard to books however here are links to some articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of interest family therapist kati morton has a video on her youtube channel on the topic of intrusive thoughts perhaps there is something in this video that can be of help as well heres a link there is also a practice that is referred to as compassionate abiding that may be of some benefit heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice best wishes hello my anxiety has been getting worse to the point where i feel like an emotional wreck right now its so stressful worrying that something will go wrong all of the time and it sucks being anxious 247 because i just want some relief my next psychiatrist appointment is on november 16th and it just seems so far away i want to be better i think its a common fear amped up i have had many times when this came up about either my daughter or my husband what will i do if this happened catastrophic thinking abounds surprisingly enough i just follow the whole scenario throughwhat i would do afterwards how would i feel etc after enough times of doing this i dont feel as anxious i know what i would do and its okay i feel im prepared enough though one never really is and i can handle it with help you may want to explore this with a therapist my children are grown adults now but i still experience vivid intrusive thoughts about their safety when i say vivid i mean horrific i also regularly get dreams of the same when my son lived several neighbourhoods over anytime i heard sirens i had a vivid picture in my head of something awful happening to him and held vigil over the phone just in case it took the ybocs checklist of obsessive compulsive thinking and there are statements pertaining to this  which surprised me as i pretty much assumed ocd was about cleanliness and order before then thank you for your replies sorry it took me so long to say thanks  life is hectic these days i really appreciate you guys taking the time to reply and for putting those links thanks again can you tell im canadianlol you guys my brain just shuts off when im around people im not comfortable withmost people fr its crazy and i hate it its really messing with my life anybody have any advice its really getting to me its tough to struggle with that one thing that helped me is to focus less on how i feel and more on what i am trying to accomplish and what they might be feeling for example in walking up to a cashier i focus on paying for what i am buying and try to be thoughtful to them because they are probably tired from being on their feet all day when you focus on those two things and do your best to ignore the rest it should help you get through it easier it also helps to put yourself in the situation over and overeven if it isnt comfortable and allow yourself to make mistakes without criticizing yourself it gives you the chance to build on what isnt working each time you try it may help to observe the people you are around and how they conduct themselves ive said this to others before watch people around you interact learn their non verbal cues and learn what seems to work and not work adapt then your own manner of contact you might find that if it were to be less strained then you would find such situations less irritating and possibly even enjoyable i get uncomfortable too and some types of people are really hard for me to be around but i actually practise such situations  yes i rehearse conversations hi guys does anyone have any helpful tips on coping with flight anxiety i am flying tomorrow and i am starting to get really nervous i fly regularly as i have to keep up with family its a short 3 hour flight and ive been flying for around 5 years 34 times a year i was fine in the beginning i loved my first flight but in the last year ive started to feel terrible in the plane and before the flight i was so horrified the last time we flew i cried in my boyfriends arms when we felt a bit of turbulence i tried breathing exercises and distracting myself with readingcolouring but every time i feel a bit of shaking i stop doing whatever im doing and i just start to look around and notice whats happening when the turbulence stops i continue to read and everything is fine i really want to overcome this as i feel like a complete nervous wreck ball and i hate that i dont know if ive got the strength to overcome this and if i do have it how to find it in myself and put it to good use any tips are greatly appreciated thank you hello lamb i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit here are links to some articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of some interest i dont know of course if youre here simply seeking advice with regard to this particular concern or if you plan to hang in here with us however should you be planning to continue on we hope you do may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting hi i love coffee but it does up my anxiety and insomnia even an am cup only more some times than others when i gotta get off coffee gunpowder greentea is a good substitute im not as mentally keen on it but it does clear my head with more of a chill vibe and it fends off headache and i think it curbs appetite more than coffee though i drink more cups of it than i do coffee i can drink gunpowder all morning to midday without stressing from it i wish i could quit drinking coffee no doubt about that coffeine is increasing my anxiety but  i cant help it  im addicted and i like everything about coffee energy boost the smell the warmth of the cup in my hands and sharing it with family and friends going to a rather lavish haunted house with friends tonight the funny thing is i wish these types of things were actually scarycreepy i like being creeped out and getting goosebumps by suggestive subtle or spooky horror but the overthetop jump scares and prosthetic gore create a mixture of boredom and stress for me just waiting for the guy with a chainsaw to pop out of nowhere is not terribly fun or exhilarating still gotta be a good friend even though id rather spend my friday night at home in my pjs slobbing about if something happened on your flight the thing you need to remember is that the cabin crew are prepared for it and they know what to do if it happens you know the safety demonstrations at the start of flights well thats why they exist so the crew can tell the passengers what they could do if something went wrong and thats why they insist all passengers stop what they are doing to give it full attention the chances of something happening on your flight are very very small think about all the flights every day taking off from airports that land successfully at their destination then think of those flights how many do we hear about that have crashed most of the time plains crash because they are either flying through dangerous space for example above a war zone or something unexpected happens with the weather while you are in the air but then pilots will do their best to land at another closer airport turbulence is nothing to be scared of turbulence is like really strong wind that shakes the plain a little bit many many successfull flights pass through turbulence in fact i think i can say with some confidence that the majority of flights deal with some turbulence anyway its a scary part of the flight like your ears popping but a normal part good luck ive found that i am far more relaxed on a plane when im completely exhausted  but thats probably not the best solution worked great for me this morning though and because i was running a bit late i was more worried over will i make my flight instead of being anxious over the flight itself and there was a huge relief when i did make my flight thank you all for your replies the flight was fine in the end it was very windy when we were landing and the plane shook quite a lot but the most important thing is it landed safely i am getting really tired of feeling that way and not being able to deal with my anxiety i guess after a few more flights i will be completely fed up with my anxiety and stop allowing it to overcome me ive decided in no way i will let this prevent me from seeing my familythe world of course i say this now when my next flight is a few months away ill probably feel differently the day before the flight thank you all again for your time im so glad your flight was okay good for you for actually doing it hugs i am constantly worry about the world ending or how i would die it has pretty much taken over my life i cant sleep and if i do i am having nightmares because of this phobia i have that fear too i also worry that anyone from my close family is going to die and how painful it will be my worry is so big i sometimes find it difficult to sleep especially when ive had an exhausting day in my experience thinking that dying and family members passing away happens to absolutely everyone no exceptions helps everyone has to deal with death at some point so the only thing we can do is live our life and not worry about it its going to happen sooner or later so whats the point of worrying about it i was thinking about this fear literally for hours before i even saw this post up until now so it really jumped out as something i can relate to completely this fear somehow became strong around september but i have also experienced this at age 15 where i became fixated on feeling that i was going to die soon now i am afraid of dying in my sleep and think about it every night it has made it worse that my former boyfriend died recently and my best friend died of cancer and i am quite young to know two people who were closest to me pass away i obsess over fear of family dying too lately i think i became obsessed with control i am supposed to be asleep now but i am not out of fear something that i fixate on lately is the risk of my medications causing cardiac problems and thinking something will happen to me if i go to sleep nothing seems to be helping my heart is racing i am sorry that you are struggling this too i wish i had solutions but i am trying to use coping skills to try to relax and forget about the fear if you are in therapy hopefully that can help i am starting to go for other reasons but i am beginning to talk about it i am hoping it will help at least a little bit the more i avoid thinking about all this the better i think about that too when i am not feeling physically well the only thing i do is practice self care even if it feels odd i have also tried some exercise running on a rebounder as a therapist once suggested that sometimes that tricks the flight or fight part of the brain in to thinking i am running away from the danger and thus helping to quell some of those panic brain chemicals i also know that feeling that way keeps me from enjoying those i love and life just sometimes the thoughts tend to get a life of their own i am constantly worry about the world would end i would not be able to live my life before that happen i dont care what anyone says ive come to the conclusion that no one is taking away my meager 1 cup of coffee a day ill use 1 tea spoon from now on of coffee to make that cup which i believe is quite moderate thank you for sharing your experiences everyone it helped me make my mind my anxiety has been through the roof i know some of it is financial stuff mostly being unwise and some of it about finding a new home for my dog i cant get it to calm down want to give in to the urge to majorly restrict i try not to stress the stress hi jessharp im feeling for you hope this isnt horribly lame but sometimes i think of my finances as a video game i remember that money is not really real and it helps me hope it helps you i cant watch the commercials about animal abuse on animal planet i always change the channel when they come on content note mentions of depression mentions of anxiety around deathillness of others not detailed lately ive been having some good days good as in i feel like im feeling supported or ive worked through some things with my t etc but one thing ive noticed about my good days is that it often comes with the fear of crashing and returning to one of my bad days for example ill have a good day because im feeling supported by my friends even though im struggling ill think about how grateful i am for my good daybut then ill suddenly get anxious about something awful happening to my friends like illness death accidents etc then i either spend the rest of my day being anxioussad good day ruined or i continue on but now carrying the fear of crashing into a bad day again part of me feels like i shouldnt be dividing myself into good and bad days anyway but sometimes i do wish i could have one good day without fear does anyone else experience something similar how do you usually work through this fear of crashing hope this all makes sense i think we all or at least most of us have this experience to one extent or another i certainly do my allpurpose remedy for intrusive thoughts as well as anxiety fear  other disturbing emotions is a technique referred to as compassionate abiding perhaps youre familiar with it if not heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice may it be of benefit thanks for this skeezyks the link is really helpfulive heard about this kind of mindfulness in various capacities but its hard to find one this accessible i appreciate it i can relate to this so much ive had several times when everything felt good ive had one of those good days or nights and ill feel like something bad will happen one time i went to a dance at my college campus and it was a great night the music was great and energetic the people were awesome and there was a lot of positive energy in the room but later that night there was a feeling of doom that something bad would happen that feeling sucks even when i felt that something bad would happen nothing bad really happened so it really shows me that anxiety is an illusion anxiety gives the illusion of doom and terror but it is really just a feeling my anxiety goes up and down i wish i could manage it properly but things seem to get in the way i think talking to someone may help but dont feel alone because i have experienced this on many occasions okay so i really want therapy i have the means to get therapy however just the thought of it makes me want to cry scream and panic any suggestions bad storms now i hate them i get such anxiety hello welp i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit i dont know as there is a lot i can offer with regard to your particular concern perhaps this is one of those things where you just have to dive in here are links to some articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of some interest family therapist kati morton has some videos on her youtube channel with regard to first therapy appointments here are links to 3 of them i dont know of course if youre here simply seeking advice with regard to this particular concern or if you plan to hang in here with us however should you be planning to continue on may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting im getting that tired feelinghard to stand up thing i get from anxiety im going to get up now and go shopping anyway we need food i will log on and work a little tonight that should help im worried about work hi welp 36  all that skeezyks suggested was great  so follow that i will also add that after being so depressed last june following that 12th  2nd years passing of my parents  i just did not care  i was never suicidal  i just lost interest in anything so i sought out help after watching a few kati morton videos  and after a free consultation i was refereed to someone i could afford  and i have been in therapy since the 2nd week of aug so here is the honest truth your therapist is there to help you  but you must want that help there are times when you will feel you must say something in order to feel better  and after end up feeling either better or worse  it is ok  that is how therapy works the most important thing to remember is tell your therapist everything  every gory detail  the more your therapist knows the more effective your therapy will be holding something back is not a good idea  i have tried out of fear  but have found that once i found the courage to say what i needed to say  i was ok  even better that ok there will be times when you tell your t something and it will get you thinking  sometimes thinking is scary and sometimes it hurts but at your next app tell you t what you felt the day after you got something off your mind your t is there to sort out the mess  not make things worst at times you will laugh while other times you might be sad  but in the end you will be whole and go on to do great things with your new life i guess that really sums it up  your new life whatever is bothering you now  once you work through it  you will find yourself breathing a whole lot easier  i promise its work  real work  you will be asked to keep a journal  your t will never ask to see it  it is for you  if you want to show it  it fine i have kept a journal since the end of june  before i started therapy  my therapist has never asked to view it but my therapist had seen a ton of my writings  i think my t has far more home work from me than other clients  but that is fine  sometimes your words can speak for you  if there is something you find hard to say  just write it down and hand it to your t  a few week ago my t got a 3 page part of my life i could not say aloud  it a work in progress anyway  i hope i have helped take care  keyplayer people just dont understand how hard it is for me to go talk to people they just dont understand i used to be afraid to call the pizza delivery guy to buy some pizza i refused to do it i had my friends do it i understand i too have an aversion to using the phone due to anxiety the best way to overcome this anxiety is to force yourself to use the phone more over time the brain will realize that it is not a situation that merits an anxiety response it is very difficult at first but even taking baby steps like ordering pizza on the phone instead of online can be very helpful hi a while back my dr switched me from xanax to klonopin and at first it worked really well at 5mg however i seem to have grown a tolerance in like a year and am already on 3mg per day im supposed to take 1mg at a time but usually have to take 2 to stop my panic and major anxiety sometimes i feel more wound up after taking it anyone have a similar experience should i go back to xanax after 10 years on xanax i had only increased from 5mg to 1mg i didnt build a tolerance this fast now im afraid itll be hard to go off it hi explodingsun56  i am truly sorry for your pain  i understand how hard it can to reach out when you have anxiety issues i would urge you to seek counseling if possible or even talk with your family doctor you are ok  so dont ever let anyone say you are not  in fact i believe you are perfect  it is not always easy to talk to strangers  i used to be the same way as you i stared a little at a time out of necessity  and found it was not so scary after all now people have a hard time keeping me quiet  lol you say your friends order pizza for you  i love pizza too  i have a dominos near me that makes a special pizza just for me  my own custom made pizza i would not have a place where i can get custom made pizza  if i did not ask so maybe the next time you want pizza  maybe a friend could go to the pizza place with and stand by your side while you order  or even hold your hand while you order it will be ok i hope i have in some small way helped  feel free to pm me anytime all my best  and once you get comfortable talking  look out world keyplayer the older you get the less people affect i was like you a long time ago since then i feel bring it on  im a man with very powerful body so nothing bothers me but you can balance that with mace and a 38 and not be afraid of anything or anybody good luck anyone have experience with getting treatment for a phobia i would like to get treatment but dont know where to turn my phobia is of doctors iatrophobia and i hate how it affects my life thank you hello blue i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit here are links to some articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of some interest one other thing that may be of interest family therapist kati morton has a video on her youtube channel with regard to exposure therapy heres a link to that video i dont know of course if youre here simply seeking advice with regard to this particular concern or if you plan to hang in here with us however should you be planning to continue on may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting ive been off and on with anxiety and depression for a while the health anxiety is taking its toll a lot of things are normal so i dont know where the pain is from i stopped taking the muscle relaxer and my right hand cramps up occasionally i have an mri scheduled for wednesday for my shoulder im running low and hardly anything seems to help now my poetry is rather depressing but its whats running through my head its like im not broken enough hugs and hope for all of you who are suffering im 35 weeks pregnant and last few days ive been highly anxious im scared of birth ive been told i have high blood sugar my hubby has court in two weeks for ongoing custody of my stepdaughter im grinding my teeth again and mouth guard is rubbing i will have a little person relying on me in a few weeks i keep crying im under the care of the perinatal mental health team i see them in a couple of weeks but it might need to be sooner i just wanna be a good mum i had cbt cognitive behaviour therapy as conducted by a psychiatrist i gained skills and mechanisms to cope with my anxieties and fears one thing that was impacting my life negatively was my fear to go out in public in addition to the cbt the psychiatrist used exposure therapy to treat this phobia basically she directed me to go to the grocery store a half hour later each week she even met me there and took me for coffee as a reward and likely to force me to be around people in a busy cafe i still have thoughts that people are constantly judging and criticising me but these thoughts have less impact on my decision to leave the house and combined with coping mechanisms gained through the cbt it makes life easier is it all doctors you fear i ask or does this pertain only to general practitioners if you are able seek professional mental healthcare cbt can be done from the comfort of your own home if a visit is troublesome for you there is plenty of written material on the subject find yourself a good book  preferably a workbook most are designed around a 12wk program it is important you make a commitment to actually do the work exposure therapy i believe you can actually accomplish this perhaps start with a walk by the doctors office next go inside initiate then a conversation with the receptionistassistants let them know of your discomfort and ask if it is possible to simply meet with the doctor at this time be honest about your fear if they are a good doctor they will take this into account and try to be comforting they may then schedule a cursory exam before something more in depth i hope all works out let us know had expectations to start the new year with motivation and control and a good routine but these past days were horrible is anyone feeling the same  sometimes i feel like giving up i hate myself oh yes where i live its freezing so its difficult to get any kind of motivation going to do anything there are quite a few articles in psychcentrals archives on the subject of new years resolutions here are links to 4 of them yes im feeling the same way i didnt feel excited about new year eve either i guess its because of the cold weather im not necessarily feeling the same way but it seems different this year hasnt started off as great but it wasnt horrible either theirs a comercial shown on tv a lot lately that really strikes fear in to me it uses music from a tv show in the early 90s a tv show that isnt so much scary but it was for me as a kid gave me nightmares i dont know why looking back its just a harmless cartoon anyway the advert shows some dancing puppets then they talk about the product being advertised then its over but for those 60 seconds its on perhaps a bit less it is terrifying and it seems to show up everywhere during the break in the news or a movie or a soap opera its everywhere i hate it im sorry youre so troubled by this i dont watch much commercial tv mostly we watch shows on our local public television station also i make a point of not watching the news on tv when my wife turns it on i leave the room however when we do watch programs on the commercial tv stations the mute button on the remote gets vigorous exercise i can empathize with you shattered i have to be careful about watchingreading news depending on my anxiety level i dont watch a lot of tv but like skeezyks i prefer public broadcasting channelsand i really dont care for commercials either several commercials have deeply disturbed me i only watch nickelodeon now so i dont have anymore problems i know there was this one commercial where hulk hulligan was destroying this guys house worse commercial ever hi crazygrl882  i am sorry for what you must endure  me too i have taken xanax since 1986  it feels like i have built up a tolerance  however i can tell if i miss a dose or go to long with out taking one i suffer from panic attacks  have need diagnosed as have phobic anxiety  panic attacks  my dosage on the bottle is 1mg qid or 4 times by mouth that does not mean i take that much  after being on the drug for so long there are days i get by with as little as 15 mgs for the whole day  other times i may need more but i have never taken more than that prescribed amount i could  but whats the point if i dont need to  getting back to your question  xanax if a faster acting drug when compared to klonopin and xanax has a shorter acting halflife to put it simpler  xanax is designed to work fast very fast  it is one of if not the fastest acting benzodiazepines  while klonopin take a while longer  it tends to last longer as far as the effect of that drug personally i would be more concerned with which drug makes you feel your best  and dont worry about tolerance  they will all  feel  like they are not working  when in fact they are if you are suffering from panic attacks i would ask your doctor to put you back on xanax try not to be concerned about how much you take  as long as you do not go over the prescribed dosage  rather how you feel my suggestion would be xanax  with a set maximum dose set by you and your doctor  and on days that are aok  just break one in half and see how you feel taking a half after instead of a whole you might find that 5mg  three times a day would work fine and on days with more stress  you would have the extra without exceeding your maximum dosage like i said  i just take what i need  of course being on the same drug for over 30 years  you kinda get to know it  lol i know anxiety  depression  loneliness  and i have feelings that wont be described until they come out with the dsm 7  plus i am trying to get over grief and loss  if that were not enough you can throw in dysphoria while you are at it  i have such a fun time  not really you will be fine  i can assure you of that  xanax  klonopin are very close and equal as far as mg to mg  xanax fast  last short  klonopin slower  last longer  that really the only difference  i am not a doctor or any type of medical professional  just someone who has seen too much i hope i have helped  if you need me  just pm me take care  keyplayer hello welcome to pc i agree that the right therapist could help you work through this i hope you get this resolved and i also dont get it i went to bed without a worry i already slept for a while so i was relaxed enough to fall asleep but then i wake up and feel all shaky and i cant sleep anymore and the heating in my building is off at night so when i try to read to distract myself my arms and hands get very cold whenever it snow i get physically sick when i smell snow in the air i didnt really care for snow when i was a toddler and by the time i was six year old i didnt really like the smell it had made sick to smell it and within a year i became absolutely terrified of snow because i moved into another city i live there before but i didnt know why i had gotten sick before but it was never as bad as it was when i was seven years old i live in a city that had containment water due to a chemical spill that had happen before i moved to a city a chemical plant had invent a bug repellent in a form of a spray that was supposed to kill bugs when sprayed on but it didnt work so a number of people had call in to complained and they did a callback on the bug spray refunding the money to all those who had bought the bug spray the chemical was transport in a truck that had some kind of accident on a road and the chemical spill out on the road and had gotten into the water the resident woke up the next morning and found ants and other insect dead and it was found later on when people started complaining that they were getting very sick so those who had become very sick all complained that had drinking water or had touch the water in someway but no one who had become sick had become suspicious of the water because it look clean and tasted normal it had never occurred to anyone that it may have been the water that had made them sick it wasnt until someone had taken a sample and found out that there was bug repellent in the water and they trace the chemical to a company who had a truck transporting the chemical somewhere else and the driver apparently wasnt aware that chemical had end in the water the company was shut down but the water is still really bad i had drink water without being informed that there had been a chemical spill i lost two years of my life being sicked i missed half the school year and i couldnt play with my friends because of how gravel ill i had become and no doctor know what was wrong with me i could still develop cancer or eventually have amnesia because i had drink contaminated water i got trapped in snow and couldnt get out of the driveway my fear of snow had intensified and now i feel claustrophobia and get physically sick i feel like i am dying and i feel trapped like i cant get out i dont want be a home but i dont want to leave my house i just want to go somewhere during the winter where it is warm all year around im sorry to hear about this i dont really know how to help you but it may help to talk to some friends in so you can distract yourself from your feelings the best thing to do is to contact the help of a counselor im sorry if i couldnt help are there any places suitable to go for a walk i was once quite active outdoors including even camping in winter those days are now behind me but i still try to get out even if it is only for 510min there is a park nearby with a lot of snow over it i have a pair of snowshoes which allow me to tromp around a bit it gets my blood pumping and cheeks rosy i usually reward myself with something to warm me up when i return an evening walk beneath the streetlights in softly falling snow i find to be quite beautiful hi i used to have this problem really bad a few years ago but it went away but now its back i really need to go to the bathroom but im so anxious about people judging me for many things like how long im in the bathroom or how much toilet paper i use etc this anxiety makes me not want to go if anyone is near me when i need to go to a public washroom i tend to freeze i do my best to talk myself out of this fear and eventually i do go but it takes a lot of effort and energy to do a basic task how do others cope with this i panic that people are looking at me through the frack between the stall wall and the door if i can completely see them they can completely see me so does anyone else have this fear that when they leave this world they will just be forgotten fade from everyones memory i do and its terrifying actually this is my goal to simply disappear as totally  completely as it is possible for a person to disappear from this world to fade away like the cheshire cat leaving nothing behind but my grimace for a while there will still be records of my having existed thankfully no one will pay any attention to them but if i could i would erase every last vestige of myself from the world songs that skip make me anxious if im listening to a song and it skips i cant listen to it the same way even if it does play all the way through i have this problem with shallet by emilie autumn because the song skipped at a certain point now it makes me anxious and when it gets to that particular part i have to turn it down that or cover my ears and my ea cd doesnt jump or have scratches on it so no excuses hello trust well i dont know a lot about these sorts of things but from what you describe this sounds like a panic attack to me i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting ps here are links to some articles from psychcentrals archives on the subject of panic attacks in case you are unfamiliar feeling better today and hoping everybody has a good weekend i have anxiety about some family concerns and let it get away from me yesterday its hard to tell what is my gad and what is part of the normal ebb and flow of life if that makes sense hugs to all those that are struggling i was a ta in a university it was my first time being a ta i confronted an aggressive and arrogant student who disagreed with the marks i gave without giving a legitimate reason he yelled at me loudly and even hit the desk i was shocked and at a loss after the student venting anger on me i reported to the professor and department chair they had a talk with him to tell his behavior was unacceptable i also sent him several emails to accuse of him i ask lots of people online and they did give me good advice on how should i have dealt with such a student however my grievance is still unresolved i can still remember the evil look and hostile behavior of that student even though i may not see him again i feel that not only do i have hatred towards him but also unsatisfied with my weakness facing this student i should have bravely fought back and asked him to leave how should i deal with this bad experience im not going to say what it was because its too personal to me to fully open up about it at this point but the effect that it had on my was that i tried to ignore it at first and tried to just push the feelings and thoughts away until the movie ended which was soon thank goodness after the movie ended i got up off of the floor because i was nervous and was being bombarded by negative feelings and fears about what may have happened to me as a child and my suspicions about all of that i felt anxiety and depression coming my way and suddenly there was a pretty intense fear that a blocked memory from my childhood was about to show up and even though i couldnt see it i had a feeling that i knew what it was and that just about sent me into a panic because i didnt want to see it and v one of my supportive alters had to calm me down and i was nauseated too but had to force myself to eat to counter the depression that was coming over me and growing by the second i ate some ramen noodles because that helps me to feel better when im depressed and afterward i still couldnt shake the depression and took a nap for about an hour and a half or so and when i awoke i did feel better and had my self control back to almost normal i just want to know if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this with the fear dread and panic of a long ago unseen memory threatening to show itself and if it could possibly be an indication that i was abused in some way that was so bad that the memory of it had to be blocked i see my t in two days but i dont know if i can hold out that long any advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance mav can i suggest you post this on the ptsd board too ill chat with you in a bit as well lately ive started to feel this tightness in chest above my heart i get super aware of this feeling when it comes which makes me anxious and very uncomfortable my heart feels highly reactive like it gets easily excited shocked scared this feeling comes and goes its less profound in the mornings probably coz i take propranalol 20 mg which im gonna ask my doc to prescribe me for afternoons and evenings as well now but i m just wondering if anybody else can relate to this feeling how diddo they dealdealt with it i can only share my experience loads of times now i have been to the hospital had doctors out etc etc because i feel that im having a heart attack they have constantly said to me your hearts fine youre hearts fine if it was a heart attack wed know its just your anxiety it reasures me for a while but then i get the same fear and i know i need to stop this because its wasting valuable time of the hospital staff last year they spent a whole day doing tests on my heart for absolutely nothing i suffer from general anxiety disorder and at times from ptsd i witnessed a homicide i have applied and got accepted for a crisis hot line position i want your feedback what can i do to help people going through a crisis that will help make things easier what do you need to hear what do you expect what questions do you want me to ask how can i get you thinking clearly again do i just need to let you vent or do you need me to help walk you out of the quicksand your feedback means a lot to me hi ive lost my magic wand it was a wand i got out of a dvd elena of avilor and i cant find it anywhere it means a lot to me because well its one of my comfort items when i feel depressed or anxious i use my wand to help me calm down but it isnt on the desk and it isnt on the floor i cant find my wand anywhere and i need to find it i need to ing find it im sorry i hope you find it im sorry i found my magic wand its in my pants ive been having something that seems kindof in between anxiety and panic attacks but one feature i havent seen anyone else post about is that i start feeling and speaking like a child or baby sometimes i literally talk baby talk like goo goo gaga type stuff and once that was followed by screaming for mama but i didnt feel very scared just thought it was interesting other times words like what a toddler would say spontaneously pop into my head and i say them out loud usually along with hiding under a blankie and crying like a sad toddler another time all within the same episode i did the baby talk toddler talkcrying and then some 12yearold stuff has anyone heard of something like this that goes with anxiety or panic hi yall im quite ashamed to write this but im going to do it anyway i have always been an anxious person and for the last two years i have been through a rough time however its going pretty well lately despite this since a week or 2 i suddenly got a vague fear that does affect my daily life i am constantly worried that everything around me is fake that i am in a coma or that i am dreaming that everything that happened in my life and now happens in my life has never happened and never is happening that the people i love do not even exist it sounds really crazy now i am writing this down  i do not understand where this fear suddenly comes from though i also wonder whether i actually believe in it or whether it is more of a fear itself i think it is mainly fear but i keep wondering why we are here on earth what i am doing here in the world why i look like the way i look i want to have answers to everything because i feel so unsafe in one way or another when you think about it life is very vague right we do not even know why we are here how we got here and what it would be like if life had never been possible then there was just nothing at all  how strange is that i probably think too much and too deep and sometimes i am almost afraid of becoming psychotic although i have never had psychoses every time i experience something fun i think there is no point in enjoying it because it is not real this is your experience but the people around you are not real maybe you are controlled like in a computer game or you are in a coma and this is all an illusion  i find it difficult to explain  i also do not know if there is a type of underlying depression somewhere i am afraid of death on the other hand i long for death because i want to know what happens then and i feel like i am going crazy about the concerning and anxious thoughts like i said i have had a difficult period and am now recovering from it things are finally getting better and i feel happier but now i think it does not matter how i feel because everything is fake for example i like being with people i love helping people i love but there is no point in helping people i love if these people dont even exist maybe this is a kind of derealization  depersonalization or im just going crazy i just think its a very scary idea that we do not know why we are here there is just no explanation and that makes me all think of things myself  i am now also afraid that i will never be able to enjoy life again because i am afraid that life does not exist at all in any case i will stop rattling now i wondered if anyone has any idea what this is and why i suddenly think this way and if someone recognizes it  on google i came across some recognizable experiences nevertheless i like to post my own story here well im not qualified to suggest what it is youre experiencing or why it is youre thinking this way perhaps its simply the result of a buildup of anxiety however from my perspective this is something you really need to work through with a mental health professional otherwise any suggestions you get are as likely to be wrong as they are right and they may just make you even more concerned than you already are under any circumstances theres certainly nothing to be ashamed of here are links to a couple of articles from psychcentrals archives that may be of some help with what you are experiencing hi im late but id love to answer your question look some time ago i would have identified myself a lot with that but today i see how it makes no sense to think like that i mean are we here right i and you and thousands of people in the world and there should be a sense for all that and as much as we do not know and probably will never know it is important that we look on the other side these thoughts will not help you in your recovery they will only sink you deeper i mean how could they help you so after i started to think like that after i started to stop looking for meaning in life and tried to make sense of it everything changed it is common to have episodes of depersonalization when you are anxious especially if you are curious and want to frantically find out everything about everything the origin of life take it easy because you will not get there in my case i wanted a proof at my feet that god existed so i being unable to do worse decided to search for reasons to believe and not believe in god and everything absolutely everything about both beliefs made sense and it started to eat me up and eat me alive i was in such a big crisis and i did not know where to run but one day i decided i would take it easy and talking to other people also got the help needed from what i have read your case is more to the derealization than the depersonalization itself although it could be both research it it is very common to feel this studies say that everyone will have at least one episode in life just try not to feed those thoughts but anyway i think what i have to tell you is this take it easy and ill be here if you need to thank you so much for your response i feel a bit better now i share my thoughts instead of keeping it to myself it also helps me to be with other people and have distraction but sometimes all of a sudden i feel really axious and i have these thoughts like what if all of this isnt real i will never find out whether other people are truly alive  that they are in the same room as i am right now perhaps this is a dream it sounds so silly now i am writing this but sometimes it suddenly attacks me that anxiety feeling did you also experience that so not only wanting to know why we are here but also the anxiety feeling of what if i am not really alive feels really like you are trapped or something i just cant understand life but you are right  we all dont know why we are here and probably we will never really know btw i wish you all a happy new year well yes i experienced it all exactly this way and i dont think i actually talked to anyone at the time but i dont regret it the problems exist and we should not give in to them for if we do we will be doing everything we should not do you control your problems you who faces them this is the nature of life and this is part of his maturation that was another thought that helped me you know youd be surprised at the number of people going through existential crises obviously they present themselves in different ways and each faces them differently but yes everyone goes through it especially in the youth that is when we want to understand everything and know ourselves and even if this is not the case okay each one in its time we are constantly getting to know ourselves and when you get out of it youre somebody else think about it as much as youre not religious or believe in some god or something greater what would become of us without the problems we would have everything in hand and there would be no evolution either as a person or spiritist i know its easy to talk but its not like ive never been through it i went through all this to be here today and be able to tell you that you can too and i can assure you its worth it and no your feelings do not seem ridiculous give them value and another way i found to distract myself from all of this was to try to get to know myself better and read about things that i liked or even about similar experiences i really had no idea who i was or what i wanted so i decided to take some time for me this helped me a bit because when you know who you are you know how to control your feelings you know what you should do for yourself or not i also learned to say more the word no something very important sometimes when im worried about the point where such a crisis hits me i think no laura youre not going to feed this and then i get distracted by something again just accept that it is a phase that you have to go through and does not prohibit you from feeling your feelings you have the right yes i do i get chest pains so bad it feels like a heart attack when i have a panic attack i typically put my hand on my chest i have also had a couple ekgs done so i know its not my heart it doesnt hurt to get it checked out by a doctor you have described a lot of what i have felt it helps to know other people feel this too just a couple days ago i thought i was a computer program and not a person the reason i thought this was because there will be times of eerie synchronicity for example i will be reading a word just as someone says itbut this will seem to happen multiple time over a period of days i used to shrug that off as weird but lately think similar thoughts as you have described i will share with you something i have discovered about this it may just be my own experience but i think this has to do with some kind of brain injury it doesnt have to be a major injury so dont worry about that i think it can also be from medications too much sugar caffeine or alcohol i had a toxic experience with mercury in a medication i was having the awful physical symptoms but the derealizationdepersonalization got much worse i felt comfort in the fact that the drdp meant that my brain was trying to heal itself it makes sense that your brain would put itself into a dreamlike state so as not to have to expend more energy processing information while trying to recover its why we sleep after all you mentioned that you had gone through a hard time i would consider that another form of brain trauma while you are experiencing stress there are neurochemical processes that can change your brain but luckily our brains have neuroplasticity which just means that damage in one part will prompt growth or compensation in another part what has helped me are my pets and really trying to take it easy and get enough sleep i have made an effort to avoid negative stress as much as possible i have noticed that when i cannot i revert back a little into dpdr do not worry it will get better with rest i keep hearing war cyrens outside you know the ones that go off when you need to evacuate i know its logical that in england they probably wont be going off at the moment because its raining and it seems quiet outside apart from the cyrens but i dont know why i can hear them i just can about 6 months ago i started to change ive been dealing with social anxiety for all my life but it started to slowly dissappear but that wasnt the only change that happened as time passed i started to become less sensible it started with small things like not empathising with people and it eventually lead to a lack of empathy and very shallow emotions though this has made it very hard to keep relationships ive learned how to live with it and i strictly follow certain rules to avoid harming people that i care aboutcare about me last but not least the scariest change im going through is depersonalization i have very varied episodes from feeling that everything is fake to thinking that im dead and being scared of finding my own corpse anywhere they can happen anywhere but they usually occur at night when im alone or if something triggers it eg certain types of music i can cope fairly good with them but theyre still a pain in the  i think my brain uses depersonalization and apathy to cope with the anxiety and though im very happy with my life right now as its not that difficult for me to meet new people or to cope with depersonalization the episodes are getting worse and im scared ill become even more apathetic and feel nothing is there any way i can get my emotions back and teach my brain to cope with anxiety differently thank you so much hello nalek im sorry youre experiencing this difficulty im afraid theres not much i can offer personally with regard to this however heres a link to an ask the therapist article from pcs archives in this article a therapist replies to someone wrote about having experienced a loss of the ability to feel emotions likewise heres a link to another ask the therapist article where a therapist replies to someone who wrote saying that they feel reality is unreal ultimately my personal feeling is that this is probably something that would be best explored with the help of a mental health professional perhaps some other members here on pc will have some similar experiences they can share i wish you well ps heres a link to a third ask the therapist article wherein a therapist replied to a person who wrote they were experiencing weird and crazy thoughts and questioning reality the reply this therapist offered was a bit darker than the two above but i thought it might be worthwhile to provide you with the link im curious to know if anything happened 6 months ago that you could possibly attribute to your current loss of feelings it sounds like you are someone who is pretty stoic already by your description of how you cope the other thing i would think of is did you increase a dose of something or take something new even herbal supplements i too have social anxiety my whole life but have had sudden onset of new symptoms that i found had an external cause im on the brink of a panic attack because of the most stupid reason i used to text my ex while listening to a playlist i made a long time ago we would chat late into the night while i listened to the same songs over and over again for some reason i decided to listen to these songs some of them i listened to regularly while others were specific to the playlist and i never listened to them outside of the playlist one of the songs that i rarely listened to outside of the playlist started playing and it immediately felt like a gut punch my heart leapt from my chest and tears came to my eyes my ex and i broke up about a year ago does anybody know why little things like that can be so psychologically damaging i have a similar problem i listened to the same greatest hits album in the car while my late husband was in the hospital as a way of comforting myself this went on for nearly three months before he passed away im ok if a popular song that ive heard a lot comes on the radio but if i hear one of those songs i rarely hear outside of playing this album it is gut wrenching i think its just a matter of association i remember being in that place whiteknuckling it in the car completely stressed out knowing it was near the end then i think last time i heard this he was aliveits an avalanche of emotions when i was a kid i hated this song from a comercial i hated the song and the comercial it gave me nightmares well last year they did on tv the top 50 comercials over the past 20 years my first thoughts were they are going to do that song they are going to do that song so i avoided watching it that is until i turned the tv on with the intention of watching something on another channel well the programme about comercials came up and id chosen that moment to turn it on when they were doing that bloody song complete with the freaky comercial pictures they used too urg hello azteker i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here

reviewed  approved so please keep posting does mess and clutter effect any of you i get so anxious about it and stress myself out my son is so messy he has severe adhd that contributes he also has odd and a low iq that makes it hard to get his help i cant even come close to having a clean house unless i clean several hours a day i dont have that kind of energy especially with depression i do about an hour a day slightly more on weekends i wont have people over because i get so embarrassed like i seriously panic when someone shows up it doesnt look like i clean at all i get sensory overload because of it im constantly mad at my child and sometimes resent him what to do im sorry youre having to deal with this yes mess  clutter would be difficult for my wife  i to deal with too fortunately for us its just the two of us plus we live in a townhome so things stay pretty clean although we do have a dog  he helps keep the place from being too immaculate also were not savers anything we dont seem to have a use for we get rid of over time ive actually gotten rid of some things i now wish i had back but its too late now from what you wrote it sounds as though youre doing more cleaning than we do on a daytoday basis i tend to do quite a bit of spot cleaning im always on the lookout for areas that seem to need attention and if i see something i take care of it thenthere that way theres less of a need for major cleaning efforts unfortunately i dont know as there is much of anything i could suggest to you here you didnt mention how old your son is or if hes in school etc perhaps if hes receiving special education or rehabilitation services learning to help out around home could be something the people who work with him could focus on if not perhaps looking into what might be available in terms of inhome services might be worth while the key here it seems to me is to find some way of teaching him to help take care of things his disabilities probably do contribute to his messiness but they should not be allowed to be an excuse for turning you into his servant i wish you well i have a great need for order i need things neat and tidy things like the hardcore cleaning may fall by the wayside for example i dust vacuum scour the bathroom regularly but i am lazy when it comes to things like baseboards and the oven but my place is always presentable and orderly  you never know if someone might pop over this stems from prior experience my mother allowed the house to get cluttered in university i lived with an aunt who was a hoarder messes make me anxious too i cant work on school stuff without having a clean area around me i just have to clean up my area near my desk before i start working which takes time as i realize all the other things i need to do i cant do anything productive without having a clean area my anxiety goes through the roof i know this isnt a thing but i was wondering peoples opinion on this i have social anxiey that is a definite i dont know if id call myself claustrophobic because i dont really put myself in small spaces when i am around a lot of people i start to become very uncomfortable im anxious at the idea of having to relate or talk to other people but thats not a factor here just the thought of people around me makes me anxious everything gets really loud for me i start to squirm if someone bumps into me i feel physical pain inside me i become hyper vigilant i just dont like to be around people like at all my father says hes the same way were misanthropes he says does anyone else feel this way around people im not sure if its my social anxiety or some form of claustrophobia i feel the same way i often feel an ackwardness when around too many people i seem to loose all train of thought and find it very difficult to make conversations i am too preoccupied on different things such as what they think of me why a they looking at me the way they are and how am i going to get out of this situation as for claustrophobia i do believe that there is a link between claustrophobia and social anxiety i think many people believe that claustrophobia is purely a fear of small spaces such as lifts caves and small rooms but they forget about the situation like talking to people and feeling as though you are suffocating in a situation that doesnt have to be physically confined but internally confining i was looking online and found this info about how there is in fact a link between the two causes of claustrophobia claustrophobia is actually generally considered a symptom of anxiety rather than its own anxiety disorder this is likely because most people that develop claustrophobia already have at least some type of mild anxiety take my anxiety test to find out more about your anxiety this makes some sense too because several disorders seem to be affected by or play a role in claustrophobia generalized anxiety disorder it seems that generalized anxiety disorder seems to play a role in the development of claustrophobia most likely there is some correlation between what led to a person developing the condition and what leads to the development of anxiety panic disorder when someone is in an enclosed space they become more likely to suffer from a severe panic attack chances are that the individual was at greater risk of panic attacks or panic disorder which means that they already showed at the very least a genetic predisposition tot the condition social phobia those with social phobia often experience a feeling of needing to escape as part of the condition although generally its not limited to enclosed spaces its possible that some of this fear ends up tangentially passing over to the way they feel in any small space hopefully this is helpful in someway an inspiring story im sure all these years havent been easy on you but you took charge of the situation and you fixed it not just fixed it you made it fun celebrate this victory and take the same attitude to your life moving forward all the best had to go to the hospital few weeks ago for a minor surgery was horrrible as soon as i entered the building my heart started pounding and i felt i lost control of myself considering how new this is to me it was so scary i hope this goes away i felt extremely distressed just reading this its very difficult for me to think about the idea of being locked away somewhere with people and i have to stay attentive 247 so i do not even leave the house i feel that there is something beyond anxiety and i like to call it social claustrophobia when i find myself in situations where i have to face this kind of thing i soon find myself losing my head and the fine line between sanity and insanity i feel like im not too far from the last option i often find myself so nervous around people that it is so common for me to lose my line of reasoning in the middle of speech or else to forget words memories sometimes i just say to the person hey i have something to tell you and i forget its really quite embarrassing i feel ridiculous over time i have forgotten so much and today my memory is so bad all i wanted was not having to go through all this my doc just prescribed me lyrica for anxiety and i am ashamed to say that i cannot bring myself about to take it i read the basic side effect profile after i came home and they were scary like a few of them were swollen lymph nodes arms legs kidney damage cognitive impairment weight gain and so on i have health anxiety so this is pretty heavy for me to digest i keep feeling guilt like im letting my doctor down and mostly myself down by not even trying it but if i try it i know ill be in a constant state of panic can anybody else relate to this i understand every time i read the potential side effects of my meds my anxiety goes through the roof lithium alone can cause kidney and thyroid problems i had to have an ekg for an old med due to heart risks it is scary in my case though i just cant live without my meds at least not a happy life so i take them if you are anxious speak to your doctor about the risks the odds are likely small for the major ones and make your decision from there man i cannot stand the way that doctors play fastandloose with medications i take 900mg of lyrica daily for neuropathy and nerve damage i have heard of gabapenten being used as mood stabilizer and for anxiety but this is the first that i have heard of lyrica being used for anxiety yes buspar is an antianxiety med lyrica is not do as recommended and voice your concerns not so much concerning the sideeffects but about the difference in the medications i am having some serious concerns that i need to see if anyone else has experienced i have had a stressful 5 months i moved i was diagnosed with an autoimmune skin disease called hidradenitis suppurativa and fell into a pit of anxietydepression it feels as though i am stuck in a loop because i am sure many of the symptoms i feel are from my anxiety but once i latch onto a thought its like i cant let it go i have been in a relationship for 4 years and we had been living together for almost 3 years when i had to move back home due to health concerns ever since then i feel like i cant connect with people i cant feel love or connection and i feel like a monster i dont know if this is a symptom of anxiety or depression or what is happening to me but i literally cannot remember what happiness or love feels like at this point and i am so frustrated because i know that i do love these people because nothing has actually changed other than my perceptions i suppose i should also mention that i quit smoking marijuana around the time these symptoms of anxietydepression started everything in my romantic relationship and family relationships were great prior to this and i just cant understand why i suddenly cant feel anything is it because i am so focused on it is it because i really am a monster am i losing my mind am i just so stuck in my head that it will never be possible for me to get better i used to be so confident in what i wanted a career kids marriage and since this all started i have these thoughts that none of that can ever happen for me since i cant feel connection anymore i feel so bad because my boyfriend and family have been so supportive the last few months and i have just been faking a lot of my emotions just to not alarm anyone the only thing that has gotten me by is the thought that actually crazy people dont realize they are crazy so im probably not actually going crazy i should also mention that i have been unable to see a psychologist due to insurance but i also will not take any antidepressant or anti anxiety medication due to a bad allergic reaction i experienced to an antibiotic i was on for my skin i am all for natural remedies and have been wanting to try cbd oil as i have heard it has done wonders for other people and this all started after i quit smoking marijuana which i know greatly affects the limbic system where our emotions are housed has anyone else tried cbd oil or experienced what i am going though i just want my life back and i want to be able to genuinely tell my boyfriend how much i love him and my family i love them without this annoying anxiety in the back of my mind that was never there before i dont really know where to exactly put this but most of my problems see to be related to my anxiety so figured id post it here now because of my anxiety i depersonalize however yesterday at school it didnt feel like my typical depersonalizing usually i feel like im in someone elses body and someone is talking for me and my body parts arent mine yesterday i started with a rapid heart beat and my learning leader put her apple watch on my wrist cuz she has an app on there that detects your heart beat mine was 143 it eventually went down to 90 but my hands began to shake more violently through out the day when i started getting anxiety it didnt feel like how i usually feel like im surrounded by things that want to attack me it instead felt like i was being chased when i finally began to break i went into the break room to text my mom to come and get me when i was walking in the hallway i suddenly felt like i wasnt in reality it hit me like a train but i realized it didnt feel like my particular depersonalizing experience i didnt feel like i was in someone elses body everything seemed to look weird i dont know how to particularly describe it like it was distorted i began feeling as if i was in a dream and i slowly became more convinced i was dreaming i kept thinking this wasnt reality nothing was real i had a lot of trouble speaking id forget what i had just said in the middle of a sentence and completely forget what i was trying to say or was about to say when i had to go with my mom for christmas shopping before my sister got off work i felt like any mi ute my legs were going to give out and collapse i felt like i couldnt walk properly i had to hold onto my mom to make sure i was walking right i kept obsessing over my shaking hands kept checking my pulse to see if it was going up i tried not to think about it but i couldnt stop this morning it started off like yesterday but today i had something new happen no matter how many deep breaths i took i felt like my body wasnt receiving oxygen i felt as if i was legitimately suffocating i have no clue what happened so i have no clue what could have caused this this sounds very similar to my experiences have you been taking any new meds even otc had any vaccines recently eaten anything like fish the symptoms you describe sound like some sort of toxicity dont discount anything even a cold medicine because this is what did it for me actually there is a longer story but i want to wait for your response first and hope you are feeling better because it can be very scary when did you start suffering with anxiety did anything trigger it what triggers it now i remember as far back as age 6 i would just start hyperventilating out of the blue my mom would make me breathe into a paper bag not sure if it really worked or the attack just passed on its own i dont remember why this would happen at the time these days the culprit is my own mind i often get paranoid about things that arent even true or relevant for example ill imagine my bf cheating on me ill obsess over it until i convince myself its true even though there is absolutely no reason to believe it or when im driving i think about what if i get into an accident its when my mind wonders like this that i start to shake breathing gets shallow and i have to chew an ativan stuck in tunnel vision certain that the future only holds the worstcase scenarios ive had my ups and downs lately but it has been a few months since ive felt this desperate grasping for reassurance i guess i should admit to myself that i am handling it okay all things considered im not crying my eyes out every few hours like i might have done before im just sitting with this feeling letting it wear itself out rather than feeding it my energy and prolonging its life hopefully hi im late but id love to answer your question look some time ago i would have identified myself a lot with that but today i see how it makes no sense to think like that i mean are we here right i and you and thousands of people in the world and there should be a sense for all that and as much as we do not know and probably will never know it is important that we look on the other side these thoughts will not help you in your recovery they will only sink you deeper i mean how could they help you so after i started to think like that after i started to stop looking for meaning in life and tried to make sense of it everything changed it is common to have episodes of depersonalization when you are anxious especially if you are curious and want to frantically find out everything about everything the origin of life take it easy because you will not get there in my case i wanted a proof at my feet that god existed so i being unable to do worse decided to search for reasons to believe and not believe in god and everything absolutely everything about both beliefs made sense and it started to eat me up and eat me alive i was in such a big crisis and i did not know where to run but one day i decided i would take it easy and talking to other people also got the help needed from what i have read your case is more to the derealization than the depersonalization itself although it could be both research it it is very common to feel this studies say that everyone will have at least one episode in life just try not to feed those thoughts but anyway i think what i have to tell you is this take it easy and ill be here if you need to i had a hysterectomy in 2011 right after i started having mood swings by 2012 i was first misdiagnosed with depression put on just an antidepressantit flipped me over into full blown mania after a second opinion i learned it was bipolar one childhood abuse my mother was severely mentally ill with extreme problems with rage i wont describe it ive never seen or heard of anything like her various methods of terrorizing me obviously she caused my problems ive had emotional issues for as long as i can remember seriously kindergarten i threw up and had other stress reactions for years in elementary school didnt talk enough or got too emotional over my pet dying and had to be practically quarantined to the library or got creeped out by stories no one else got creeped out by i had this big angry chip on my shoulder about feeling like i was weird and different from everybody else until i was about 14 or 15 i had a lovehate relationship with that feeling resenting how i thought everyone else felt about me versus being glad i was different from them a lot of details there that probably arent necessary but im not sure what they mean as far as anxiety or depression symptoms in a child so im just throwing it all out my ex the sociopath triggered meno exaggeration he was diagnosed as antisocial sociopath during our divorce by two independent pdocs he terrorized me my childhood wasnt perfect by any means but i was doing fine till i married the charming sociopath i first was dealing with some psychotic depression back in 2014 and anxiety followed that after i was hospitalized and missed a lot of school currently my anxiety was triggered by starting college and that spiraled into another episode of psychotic depression i think major life changes triggers my anxiety then it is hard to put a stop to it i dont really know what triggered mine but i was around 910 when i noticed now this year things have happened that has bought it all to the forefront again i get the shakes too like trembling inside apart from other things its tiring lol take care its back to this back to not being able to even think about opening the bedroom door without shaking uncontrollably if i do make it out of the room i start panic cleaning rearranging and pacing if i step outside full blown panic attacks and my other stuff hallucinations mostly get drastically worse when someones with me this stuff still happens but i use the other person to sort of ground me it makes it a little easier i cant keep doing this i have to get a job so i can help pay some bills but how can i do that when i cant even leave this room sorry im just venting i guess you need an anxiety intervention follow and heed any advice and treatment your doc offers you at this point coz this is very serious anything to get out and about coz staying in for prolonged periods of time is downward slide to a depressive hell i literally drag myself out of the bed for 1 hour walks in the sun everyday am action that goes against every fiber of my body which is screaming stay inside even if youre miserable just stay inside the world outside is scary and on and on my inner voice goes but i do it anyways and i always feel better after my walks i feel sane centered and that voice never really goes away it goes along with me for walks and is constantly screaming turn back go homemy point is we gotta do what we know is healthy and essential to keep us sane youre anxiety is obviously higher than mine so get every help from your doctor you can use benzos for temporarily getting you out of the house coz the rewards outweighs the cons in this case yes thank god for xanax i wasnt too anxious today but there was nothing to stress me out since it was just a relaxing day but ill take the less anxiety whenever i can get it mine was stress from being moved around during 20122013 moved from my grandparents to my sisters apartment then my mums house and eventually back to my grandparents that ended in what i can only assume was a psychotic break ended up being taken out of public school because i couldnt handle being around anyone thought i was an embarrassment etc i was always a quiet oversensitive kid who panicked over public presentations and pretty much any teamwork activity but that seemed to blow me over the edge it started when i was five when i went to kindergarten and everyone thought i was weird add childhood abuse and i was one messedup kid it was worst at an important part of my civilian career when i was doing well jobwise i ended up losing my job and going on disability it took five years of meds and therapy but i still live a real structured life and anxiety erupts when things change im not really sure what triggered it but i have always been anxious since i was 3 or so i had some english problems as i spoke later in life at 2 i just know that i have always been afraid of people judging me for anything i have always been extremely emotional but as a kid if i made a mistake or had to do something social i would just cry people made fun of me because i cried daily sometimes even more than that ive always been afraid of people now its mainly with presentations i still have generalized social and nonsocial fears though i grew up in a family with a hostile abusive father you always walked on eggshells because you never knew what would set him off i think that in addition to being ruthlessly bullied in middle school set me up for anxiety i dont have a good feel for triggers except one of my siblings who is a clone of my dad i have anxiety and panic attacks out of nowhere most times its distressing since my father abandoned us to cause mum severe anxiety a whole bunch of responsibility fell on me to stay strong and supportive to her and my little sister it triggered some anxiety even in me and find it difficult coping until my partner comes home from seeing a client occasionally i get stressed but nullify that by a good work out in our home gym but our mum continues suffering im taking my personal anxiety on a onedayatatime basis funny but as soon i get onstage to perform i become a wholly different person and the anxiety though can morph into stage fright just melts away the evenings at home can be difficult though i feel much better after eating dinner i have had anxiety forever first serious symptom when i realized also i have anxiety was after hospital release it was so severe i fell on the floor and all my muscles went into some form of lock down i dont even have a word for it it was more physical then psychological as if i was suspended in a cell and had to go out in the world and none of my limbs knew how to behave in third grade at recess    finding myself all alone i realized i was different and didnt fit in i was 8 i guess that was the start of social anxiety i had used to play with other kids i dont remember how i turned into an oddball i had mine early this summer i had cosmetic surgery male breast augmentation done in february something i had wanted for a long time surgery recovery went well happy with results my sister had a pool party i was so looking forward to going got there no issues later had my first attack since then i cant go to a pool or situation where i like that i need to wear very loose or baggy shirts tops also being alone in large crowds is unsettling to me wear prior to the party i was fine this is a little hard to say because in hindsight i realise i have been sick all my life i dealt with a lot of drama and trauma from a very early age and as a result learned that people are cruel and cannot be trusted early on my first memory of being different was the first day of kindergarten i realised that day that other kids were happy and full of life i on the other hand was scared anxious and vigilant about my safety i suffer from a great deal of anxiety triggered by multiple stimuli but it is a fear of what someone might do next and how it will affect me that frightens me most im frequently awake late at night its one of the benefits so to speak of being old anyway when i cant sleep ill get up  do walking meditation when its cold ill wrap myself up in a blanket i walk quietly aroundaround our dark  quiet townhome typically for at least an hour sometimes longer i focus light attention on each foot as it makes contact with the floor thoughts comego i let them arisefade at their own pace i hear the sounds of the city off in the distance i enjoy this so much that when i havent had occasion to do it for a while i start to miss it okay i havent read the original post or the comments just saw the question in the subject line i was at a concert for a childrens chorus tonight and the director in his remarks to the audience mentioned that singing is good for people because it causes them to breathe deeper and its the only thing you can do from age 18 months until you die i have always had issues with breathing exercises for anxiety but i thought this could be a good idea im going to make a list of a few songs i like that i also feel like i sing well and when i start to feel anxiety attacks or panic attacks im going to try interrupting them by singing because the singing forces you to breathe deeply ill let you know how it goes seesaw i had a bullying former manager who did a number on my self esteem confidence and mental health ever since getting canned i still feel i cant trust my new employer even though he has told me no one is going to do such things i think its because the former employer used to be nice and then she became progressively rude and nasty i could not talk to her as everything i said was dismissed pretty much i had a meltdown in my new bosses office because i thought he was going to fire me i did something wrong but since its probation they can sack you for any reason he said i need to talk to you and i felt sick and wanted to cry cried in his office and shook like a leaf he called me down and said he just wanted to do a thirty day eval and discuss what happened yesterday i feel like an idiot for doing this but it is scary for me my former employer would say i need to talk to you and i would hide for the day because it would be another ruinous everything is your fault and i wonder if you are learning disabled since you dont get it i nearly threw up because she said i need to talk to you i thought she was going fire me there ever since just heating those words sets me off i thought about asking my new boss i do like him he said i was hired for a reason and that everyone is glad to have me aboard if he could just explain he needs to talk to me but say i need to go over your eval or i just need to go over this in the office with you instead of i need to talk to you i kind of feel like thats asking too much but i dont want to have a panic attack in his office over nothing or at all thanks does anyone else feel so much of their anxiety that it turns into a selfhating rage i get so so angry with myself and i snap at people i care about because i get so twisted i want it to stop i try to use meditation or calming music when i can  but sometimes when it actually is happening i cannot stop it what works for you guys i could use some help hey i definitely get angry when im anxious like punching a wall and breaking my knuckles kind of angry what works for me is stress balls and punching soft things i dont know if you have the urge to punch things that might actually be the adhd talking there idk but stress balls are nice my therapist gave me a breathing exercise for anxiety where you put one hand on your chest and the other one on your stomach then breathe it seems kind of silly but it works also people never notice when i do it so i dont get weird looks jesus strange anticipation and anxiety and actions i need to reread your message and translate it into english it reads now as if written in some grand prix speedfest language so just wait now 1 youre recalling your previous manager who bullied you and caused you damaging mental distress 2 you were fired from the job with this manager the bully 3 you have a job with a new employer youve told him about the bullying you suffered because of your previous managers behavior 4 your new employer has assured you that you will not encounter those types of behavior by him in your new environment fuzzy on this one 5 you do not trust your new employer or others in your workplace to refrain from bullying you 6 youre previous manager was was nice to you but over time became rude and nasty and bullying she didnt value your input 7 there is a big hole here 8 you fell apart in your new employers office because you believed that he was going to fire you 9 is this the back story before 8 occurred you made a mistake did something wrong because you are in a probationary setting the new employer can fire you at any time 10 when your employer asked to see you you felt ill and you felt like crying 11 in your employers office you cried and shook 12 your employer calmed you down and told you that he wanted to accomplish a standard project 13 so in a nutshell the words i need to see you in my office makes you very anxious and you would prefer for your employer to give you an idea of why he wants to see you  oh see me about project x by the way i dont see anything wrong in telling your employer about your past experiences and ask him to be a little more specific when he wants to see you are you seeing a doctor now a psychiatrist or therapist you seem to be at the height of anxiety oh  i typed that out way too fast didnt i sorry the takeaway point is i dont want to have a panic attack if my new boss asks to see me i felt stupid about it after he did did say i am way too hard on myself and had confidence issues but other than that was doing fine next time ill see if i can ask if he can be more specific like you said waking up with anxiety in the middle of the night is the worst reading is my go to as a distraction since your building is cold maybe you could keep your hat coat and gloves nearby to stay warm while you read at times i have it where i couldnt stay in bed ill have to try the walking meditation i know that for me the anxiety compounds as i know ill be tired for work which adds stress to the whole thing i have this problem too i keep my phone with me and restart or start youtube videos there are a lot of soothing things to listen to but what works best for me is talking i like listening to dbt connections but anything will do that is a lecture im interested in they put me right out no matter how much i want to hear the material its normal for me to be anxious about all social stuff and over people im worried about but its getting incredibly insane my stomach is in knots almost every morning now as soon as i wake up ive had feelings of nausea on my worst days which is become more often now these last couple months i cant even eat in public anymore without this feeling whilst im there or without almost having a panic attack as the time for the event draws closer i cant even step outside the house without knots anymore today i even surpassed those levels and threw up without even stepping out the house i also had that knot in my stomach for the majority of today since i awoke i had my boyfriend over today though and his company helped me a lot his hugs and even just his touch never fail to calm down my insides i dont even know why im so anxious most days anymore which really pees me off especially when i tell my boyfriend that i cant think of a particular reasons for the anxiety and it frustrates him a little as he knows there has to be some sort of reason behind it which then makes me feel worse ive had a couple days lately where my hands have even just randomly shook for a little while or ive gotten lightheaded and dizzy for a while my heart is almost always beating harder and faster now too i pretty much cant do anything anymore without anxiety interfering its really annoying and frustrating me i want to escape the anxiety but theres seems to be literally no way i can right now i cant even just simply wake up without anxiety tapping my shoulder and announcing in my ear guess whos back i hate it i hate it i hate it i dont know what to do i thought i could solve this and help myself but its just gradually getting worse every few days or so it turns out i cant do this alone i cant keep living like this especially with the nausea stuff as thats becoming so frequent now i cant let that lead to anything serious possible trigger im still kinda recovering from when i used to starve myself for the majority of last year and the first 6 months or so of this year i dont want to get into that again either on purpose or because of this function rejtgomb tag  gombparentnodeparentnodegetelementsbytagnamediv1getelementsbytagnamediv0 if tagstylevisibility  visible  tagstylevisibility  visible thisinnertext   gombvalue  hide  else  tagstylevisibility  hidden thisinnertext   gombvalue  show   i want to be able to eat in public i want to be able to even just roam the shops and buy food without knots in my stomach i want to be free from my anxiety not particularly asking for tips or anything although i may need them actually so please feel free to do so i just needed to get this off my chest somewhere usually my music on my phone and some calm games i have on my ipad help distract me and help my insides calm down but the anxiety has started to just return afterwards congratulations im so happy you have found something to help treat your fear i hope you continue to work on it still if needed hey everyone ive been experiencing really bad anxiety lately and ocd my current ocd symptoms are mainly related to fears of going crazy becoming delusional losing my mind etc over the past couple weeks ill be doing something and suddenly ill get a random fleeting thought that feels like a memory for example i was just cleaning a closet in my house and i picked up my guitar so i could clean under it then suddenly i had this fleeting memory of my mom asking for the guitar case back that she had bought for my sister but let me borrow for my guitar it felt like i suddenly pictured it happening and it had a familiar quality to it like i had simply suddenly remembered it but i realized that this didnt happen and that the actual real event that occurred involved me being thankful at one time that my sister got a new case so my mom wouldnt ask for this guitar case back and i could finally have a case for myself this is happening up to 10 times per day and is triggered by completely random things in my environment i have a million examples of this and wish i could write them all down but it would just be too long of a post these types of experiences have happened once in my past also at a time when i was obsessingworried about losing my mind they were not present intermittently when my obsessions focused on other things now that i am worried about going crazy again they have suddenly reappeared and it scares me because they feel like random bits of real memories even though they usually are not accurate if the memory is too vague or insignificant sometimes i honestly cant even tell if it is an accurate memory or not simply because i dont remember the details of the actual event whenever i get these thoughts they happen so suddenly and i become terrified that i am remembering things that didnt happen and becoming delusional or psychotic and i get so worked up other times i will get sudden dejavulike experiences where ill just have a thought that pops into my head that feels really familiar or ill get a sudden creepy feeling like im about to remember something i dreamed about but then my mind cant quite access the thought and the feeling goes away its very strange and im finding it difficult to not ruminate about this which i think is making it worse ive heard about dejavu like experiences being associated with epilepsy and ive been cleared for that ive also heard about this kind of stuff being associated with the onset of psychosis so naturally im freaking out could this be caused by ocd or anxiety i know nothing of ocd but i was first diagnosed with anxietypanic attacks in 1985 and have been in the care of psychiatrists since that time i am also being treated for psychosis youve a perfect description of racing thoughts i think that when you have the suddensingleepisodes youre experiencing a minipanicattack absent the racing thoughts what you find unusual and frightening is the memory aspect dejavu like experiences of these racing and these sudden thoughts the way that they make you feel you are afraid that the experiences may be psychotic episodes caused by anxiety or ocd i never had a psychotic episode caused by any anxiety disorder i have never heard of anxiety disorder being the cause of psychosis either oh  there is a big difference between a psychotic episode and a delusion i have had similar thoughts though similar events periods the creepy feeling and the feeling of losing your mind going crazy and other terms that you use because i am so wellgifted with so very many other mentalhealth defects though im unable to say if my experiences were strictly anxiety related i assume that you are in therapy if so you should talk to heshe about these occurrences they do seem frightening alright the fear of losing your mind is an anxiety symptom textbook example what is unusual is your fear of remembering something that didnt happen a false memory that could lead you to believe yes that youre losing it you have a cycle going on but the basis i think is probably that horrible feeling that you are going to lose your mind at your next thought anxiety psychosis is something that you can get through with the amount of seroquel that i ingest daily im almost psychosis free a way to still talk to your dead friend sitting on the edge of your bed whilst knowing that you are not really talking to him but you dont stop because youve so much new crap to tell him conversely when i have had delusions yes the battle of agincourt is really being reenacted with a kenneth branaugh directing in the empty lots behind my apartment building i do things when i am delusional  i mistake fountain pens for swords and make coffee from tea bags true stories your next thought will not make you crazy i promise you are not going to suddenly flip into madness madness for me took time i think that it takes time for everyone i think that anxiety disorders make us fear a sudden plunge into insanity hmm yeah no so im sticking with anxiety and keeping ocd at bay since i know nothing of it what you describe is certainly anxiety related who prescribes your psych meds if youre not in therapy although i am old school addicted to xanax since 1985 there are some new meds that do a fine job in treating even the worst anxiety seeing your other diagnoses yes here to gad panic disorder and panic attacks a whopping hell yes to agoraphobia i am much better now and a host of social anxieties personality disorders and a fatal case of mortons toe i doubt that your prn lorazepam how much will keep the djinns away talk to your prescriber i hate to sound like a nag but with the agoraphobia and your various social anxieties only one cure  exposure therapy i was stuck in my apartment blackout curtains closed doors locked i would sometimes talk to my caregiver sometimes never say a word if someone showed up at my door  or phoned  my voice would sound croaky and ragged or highpitched like a 12yearold girls my voice was outofpractice i finally started inching my way out the door two friends  one very dear  died as i was making my way out i finally made it outside where the people were at first i could not stop talking but my vocal chords werent up to the task now i am better i have friends very old and very new and i come and go even it was hard i dont know how many times i died in my hallway i would talk myself out of trying if i could not find just the right clothes the diazepams arent going to help get you out they may help with some social anxieties though find the right clothes after that its a snap i wanted to update that today this happened again twice while i was driving i had a memory of my fiance talking about my tires and brakes and later realized that the actual memory was of him talking about his tires and brakes on his truck but i remembered it incorrectly and that bothered me also as i was in a turn lane i had a sudden memory of being with someone else at some point who wasnt in the correct turn lane but turned anyway i cant remember who and dont know if it actually ever happened or if its just a weird deja vu feeling these things cause me a ton of anxiety and im beginning to think of them more as intrusive false memories in a way and they terrify me becsuse as i think of them they come with this feeling of realness more accurately familiarity its so weird and i really dont know whats going on but i have a hunch that if i would stop worrying about it it would stop happening recently i have been experiencing chest pains im not really sure why maybe im more anxious than normal i am going off medication to switch it it just really hurts a lot let me tell you i have had panic attacks since 1985 i had a major one as christmas eve became christmas morning i have had five heart attacks since my first in 1994 i associate chest pain with panic attacks rather than heart attacks the latter feel much more like a sudden weight upon your chest that stops your breath of course i also keep nitrotabs scattered around like rosaries about the house if i have any chest pains i pop a tab or a second but if the pain continues i get the emts here pdq to check me out and as iris had one stent i have eleven in my heart and one in my right carotid artery plus the large vibrating oh never mind i dont play around with chest pain  honestly no one heart attack was exactly like another do you have a good  and i mean really good  blood pressure cuff and machine i take my bp and check my heart rate as the emts are closing in they usually get here and stay until im calm but sometimes i am scared and i will go to the er for an ekg even if you just hit puberty chest pain should put you on notice that something isnt right you may have swallowed a freefloating jalapeo seed and be suffering from gas you may be having a panic attack you may be suffering from a doubleshot of ischemic heart arrhythmia nativeson complexities you may fart and feel good about yourself again who knows you need to make friends with your local emtfolks next time you feel chest pains okay ps im guessing that minute smidgen of ativan is supposed to ward off all anxiety ailments give me an effing break living with anxiety for so long we all tend to gain considerable insight into how it works and along with that comes an understanding of how we may beat it even if its temporary like for example i use thought reassessment where i come at the same fearful thought from as many positive angles as i can and apply the okhams razor theory which means choosing the answer that makes the most sense and is the simplest explanation so i chose alternative thoughts and make them my reality works for me 5 or 6 out of 10 times thats something right what about you guys what tools have you developed with experience and time spent living in the shadows of anxiety  share it may help someone else one of the tools i love is my fidgit cube i always have a hand in my pocket playing with it before that i would shred klenex in my pocket my hands always move when my anxiety is high i have posted some of my methods in the depression forum hop over and take a look at my threads there im using elements of dbt therapy one of my many tools is to remind myself that this isnt real i know my anxiety is but its a vicious monster that needs me to feed it i have to focus on what i imagine it looks like i focus on its face and i tell it you dont control me i control you think of the movie divergent while she was in the simulator she was able to separate her self mentally hats how i see it i tell myself you arent real i control my feelings i deep breathe and continue to tell myself its temporary ive found the more i wallow and cry and get psychotic and angry i destroy others feelings and make no progress dont feed the bear starve it gl to you all i dont have very many good ways of coping im working in that but one good thing that does help is meditation and deep breathing exercises sometimes i like to interrogate the thought put it in a holding cell and ask it bunch of questions like where were you before why didnt you show up when i was not stressed how come you are just showing up as i am getting ready to enter a stressful situation i keep at it until the thought loses all credibility and power over me lol i play with hair ties picking at hems of long sleeve shirts playing with my necklace chain and if i have none of those at my disposal i will resort to either nail biting i know a horrible habit that i almost have conquered now or playing with my hair for me hairties or my necklace work best something about twisting something around my fingers just relaxes me i do a mental count of every time an anxious thought comes a knocking and label it as anxiety so say an anxious thought appears in my consciousness ill call it out as 3  means its the 3 rd thought of the day and then let it go and do whatever its called thought labeling you label the thought and let it go rather than engaging with it this is very effective try it welcome to psych central its not stupid to be afraid of a horror movie if its causing you problems especially i dont really know much about gettting rid of phobias if its causing you serious problems maybe you see a therapist who specializes in phobias there is a certain song that many years ago i heard and some bad stuff happened then i heard the song again and again bad stuff happened i became afraid of the song because every time i hear it i fear that terrible things will happen i really built it up in my mind after years and years of fearing the song i decided that i was tired of fearing it and that the song being connected to bad things was purely coincidental i have decided not to fear the song anymore simply because fearing the song is tiring and pointless like others have said i use deep breathing when it starts to really get to me and calm it with calm thoughts or ill use some form of distraction like chewing on a straw or some other kinds of soft plastic or just go soak in the bathtub close my eyes and dream or listen to what my other selves have on their minds i too sometimes use methods of taking back the power using my gatekeeper personality hell state his title and say im in charge here or if im irritated with it and feeling confident ill say you have no power over me i may even go so far as to tell it i am the one with the power now and you are beneath me sometimes though ill eat or if i have money ill drink some because that calms it and relaxes my brain you hear about so many people getting mean when they drink but its opposite for me my grandfather on my mothers side whom i never knew was like that he was all straight laced and stern and cold and serious but when he drank he was happy and cheerful and danced they say but since i rarely have enough money to make ends meet i dont get to drink much so sorry for getting off topic we now return you to your regularly scheduled program already in progress as much as i dont want to admit it when im anxious about something fidget spinners kind of help theres just something about feeling it spin so smooth that helps take my mind off of things also sometimes i will use the vape my mom got for me it has 0 nicotine so its all flavor i think it helps me because sometimes in the moment its really hard for me to deep breathe so i guess it kinda forces me to the last thing i do is listen to music there is one band in particular i listen to when i am anxious i have no idea why but their music always calms me down especially if im in the middle of an attack maybe its just because i like their music so much thoughts reframing its a positively revolutionary method in combating anxiety ill give you an example so i had an job interview yesterday im sure you all know how stressful job interviews can be so one day before the interview i started to feel really stressed but the strange thing i noticed was instead of stressful thoughts concerning my interview all my thoughts were pure health anxiety  which is my primary mental health concern so my mind was thinking of all kinds off illness that can and will happen to me scary stuff which i dont want to get into but you get my point the closer i got to the interview time the more my anxiety got riled up and out of all the anxious thoughts none were regarding the interview and job which i noticed so i finally reckoned that this is not health anxiety this is actually job anxiety which became so obvious to me at that point i started thinking the closer i get to the interview the more my health anxiety acts up so the real stressor is the upcoming interview henceforth anytime an anxious thought regarding my health came up i told my mind its just job anxiety masquerading as health anxiety and i moved on my anxiety got very much manageable from that point on coz i started reframing the problem by identifying and tracing the root source of it techniques like cbt are based on rationale and logic ive found that there are times it just doesnt work im gonna try something new using the power of belief an unshakable faith that im gonna be okay deep breaths and repeating these words for those times when rationale and logic fails to tame anxiety some people mentioned techniques where they call out to anxiety and declare thats its not in charge but they are in order to take back the power i just wanted to add that ive read some books of experts been in therapy and the best advice i ever got was never engage with anxious thoughts coz when you engage with them you give them credibility and power which they wouldnt have in the first place if you hadnt engaged with them just a thought let these anxious thoughts drift through seamlessly in and out at most just label them as anxiety but please dont engage with them because the minute you will they will become real hi everyone do you have the feeling to be alone or unwanted when you are with friends or family i find this one of the most annoying feelings with gad i even talked to my friends about this and they are always reassuring me that they want me there with them but the feeling doesnt go away even with medication does anyone know this feeling and how do you cope with that hi yes i do know this feeling i am unsure if this is related to anxiety low self esteem depression or a combination of all three but when im with friends or even talking to friends i feel that i am forcing them to do so because they are good people and just want to be nice im always asking them that they dont need to talk to me if they dont want to or i say that im not worth liking or worth anything they tell me i am all i can really say is to try to tell yourself that your friends do like you if they didnt why would they still be your friends think of all the things youve done together i know this is easier said than done as i struggle with this too hi there i am sorry to hear you struggle with this i cannot relate personally but i know quite a few members can it does not sound like a part of gad though but rather a selfesteem issue i have gad and do not share this struggle have you considered therapy to address the low selfesteem and reassurance seeking behaviours i have some phobias like that wikipedia is not my friend at times i usually bring up these things in therapy and we work out a way to make it seem less scary like prolonged exposure or overcoming the fear with cognitive reasoning or imagining something to overpower the fearstuff like that hoping the mri shines some light on the mystery fharraige health anxiety from a mystery pain is up high on my list of major life disruptors like key tones though ive been anxious about work lately its a decent job but theres almost no security i could literally get an email either tomorrow or in 10 years telling me they have to let me go i take commissions on the side and that is a nice supplemental income but i dont think its enough i have to do a lot more networking which i dont know that im up for anyhow i hope you all are managing okay these days i have had really bad arachnophobia since a young age i believe it was caused by a combination of several bad experiences with a house temporarily invaded by the giant european house spider yes thats a thing and more years of naughty kids realizing i was arachnophobic and trying to toss large spiders into my clothing what fun that was i have read that the best way to deal with phobias is good old graduated exposure and also changing how you see the feared object or event so i took the bull by the horns recently and started binge watching youtube videos made by people who raise tarantulas watching people of all ages playing with six to twelve inch long spiders and going aww its so cute let me tell you something about this awesome species makes you feel a bit silly for ever having been afraid of them the weird thing is i think its actually working ive at least gotten to the point that i enjoy watching these videos now and i can do a google image search of the ugliest most horrifying looking spiders imaginable and not feel any of my usual apprehension if you want to try this yourself heres some advice  watch videos about common jumping spiders first especially peacock spiders theyre so ridiculously cute they are the only species i have never developed a fear of other arachnophobes online often agree theyre the least intimidating arachnid am i ready to raise goliath tarantulas or the super fast rather venomous orange baboon tarantula aka the orange bitey thing lol ehhh  one thing at a time okay but i have to admit im less afraid now and i know the differences between avicularia brachypelma and poecilotheria hey thanks for your replies nike007 i think i do that too seldom telling myself that it is very interesting that it happens only with my best friends since i got out of therapy i kind of started using the strategies i learned less and forgot about them scaredandconfused you could be right i dont know what this feeling is part of i suppose that the self esteem kind of lowered itself through some experiences where the gad had its part i dont know i did have very low self esteem growing up but it did get better i would love that it doesnt ruin my friendships like it did in the past i did go to therapy and learned a lot but it is more than half a year and i forgot to use some of the strategies that i learned i know the feeling and i just accept it it sucks though always feeling alone or detached from the group i experience this alot where i work and its brought me additional isolation at times which was the last thing i needed i do great with customers though they seem to favor me this has made others jealous and i suffer the consequences then too the boss never sides with me im automatically the bad guy otherwise i do my best to wing it during social situations but i always feel that it is awkward and i like to abort sooner than later its iike i want people in my life but when they are i dont like it sigh im sorry you are experiencing this i can relate i agree that it might be related to something other than gad whatever it is its frustrating and disheartening i talk back when that thought pops up and purposely think something more realistic and positive after enough times doing this youll form new neural pathways that will be more helpful to you best wishes yes terror management theory wondering if others here have any knowledge of tmt being used in clinical settings im a fan of rankthroughbecker and beyond and i am certain of these things 1 my anxiety is a product of my inability to deal with my overarching fear of death 2 my most natural course to participating in living would be the creative 3 i lack the selfesteem and i doubt my creative abilities sufficient to the task of creating realities 4 i remain in terror outside of any reality manifested by anxiety and panic attacks i have not been able on my own to practice any kind of beckertmt methods of coping my bipolar mania is my only defense mechanism hypersexuality  not risky sexual indiscretions  allows me a lifeaffirming preoccupation to avoid my terror of death we deathobsessed know the feeling of dying as experienced in panic attacks feelings that i guess the tmt fellows would say is within the period of mortality salience i really need to reread worm at the core so tmt anyone thoughts about becker etc death  in any aspect well i dont know anything about terror management theory or rankthroughbecker im afraid this is all way beyond my limited mental capacity at this point what little bit of reading i do nowadays is limited mostly to classical chinese  zen poetry plus ive been trying onoff to work my way through some of the buddhist sutras although these sorely tax my poor mental capacity as well im not really a buddhist though either i guess you might say im a fellow traveler so to speak i dont believe in a god or in any life after death i accept the explanation for the existence of life on earth that is provided by the theory of evolution so for me when youre dead youre dead end of story and ive made a couple of strong bids in that direction the most recent one not all that many years ago now ive read that previous suicide attempts put one at greater risk of making further attempts it tends to break down a persons innate fear of it and i believe thats true based on my own experience however at this point i have no plans to try dispatching myself again im content to just wait it out  let mother nature take her course i just hope mother nature doesnt wait too long otherwise it may come to a point where ill have to give her another little nudge well now the final exit by ones own hand i cannot could not do it last night sometime yesterday i was in an hourslong panic attack death was certain i smoked some weed and calmed down i think i know nothing for certain  does anyone that my fear of nothingness is so severe so critical that i cannot conceive of sending myself into that void it will be someone elses job to see me so dispatched or nature the natural world being darwins i sometimes poke fun at eastern um stuff i am far too ignorant of western civilization to make an attempt at the eastern i fear that time really is running out and it is and although i do not have a bucket list i am so distracted by living now that i am like the moth larvae in a mexican jumping bean  when heated i fly from new york to tokyo nonstop right over the artic back to london for my bespoke clothing well of course practice makes perfect you know i watched harold and maude some months back bud cort and his suicides i think that the very best suicides are as in the movie those that you can walk away from i was supposed to die at 58 wasnt i told in 2003 that checkout was imminent i was my father died at 58 i had my first panic attack on the oneyear anniversary of his death i was supposed to die then in 1985 i am late late for my own death isnt there a joke in that no theres not death isnt the joke the joke is in the living with death ever looming cutting off heads at the next car crash me i am only still moving because others rub up against me now i started young and only stopped rubbing when i was madder than now not a lot out there on tmt but ill keep looking if i could only check it like a hatbox at the terminal i have to keep running i have to stay in motion until im brought down once brought down i will sleep without dreaming or ever waking again boxing day i am feeling really anxious today about nothing in particular just really anxious lots of racing thoughts and screaming from the voices probably contributes to my anxiety though not being in control of whats happening in my head a few years ago when i was maybe ten or eleven a horror movie came out and i was intrigued by it i decided to look it up and read the synopsis and ever since i have been absolutely terrified by it so much as hearing the name or seeing the cover freaks me out the cover is the main problem it looks just like the shower door at my house when i see the cover to the movie or even just a still or hear the title i cant bring myself to get in the shower i have to get a washcloth and wash myself off that way because im just so terrified i thought i was over it but evidently im not because its happening again this is insane i cant let a stupid movie about human taxidermy rule my life but thats exactly whats happening what can i do about this how can i make myself stop freaking out to such an extreme over something so stupid hi daretoplay  first i have to ask  do u play an instrument  second  movie triggers are very common  a certain scene in a movie ur watching can trigger a ptsd event that has been in hiding to protect you if you have suffered repeated trauma from too many triggers i would suggest seeking out a therapist it might sound scary at first  but believe me  they are there to help i was  and still am  in a bad way for a long time and i decided i wanted to be happy  it had been so long since i was happy  i sought out a therapist  and glad i did it is hard and it is work  mental work  but if you get through it  and u will  you will feel so much better me  i am a work in progress  but trying to like myself i am slowly learning that at the end of the day  liking yourself and being at peace with who you are with total honesty can bring much personal peace like i said  a work in progress all my best and welcome we have some of the greatest people on the web here  and we all want to support and help  anyway we can as i always like to say to someone new  welcome home later  keyplayer even though i have nothing interesting to say i had my first panic attack in over twenty years todayi barely made it out of the grocery store before i broke down im coming off a weekend that the husband and i had another fight this one was about privacy and space he wants to join all the sites and chat groups that i do because he thinks he is missing a part of me that i show to others and not to him he is trying to inject himself in everything i do since he woke up and realized i had been telling him for two years that we were growing apart i knew i was emotional today but i thought keeping busy and running errands would help well i didnt think about the fact that i would possibly have to deal with other people in the store and that was what did it luckily i only had a few items to pick up and was able to breath my way through i read your other thread and the stuff with your husband would drive me nuts i feel for you as for the panic attack i know how much they suck glad you were able to get through it hi everyone i need some advice and just need to vent kind of to sum it up basically i dont get out much and really want to go for a walk but im too scared to go alone i carry a decent sized pocket knife when i have to go out and plan on buying pepper spray as well i also have another knife in my car still though im so scared that someone is going to attack me or something i dont have any friends i can ask to go or any family thats home during the time i usually want to go i really want a large dog id feel completely safe going if i had one but i already have two dogs unfortunately i dont know any of my neighbors well enough to ask if i could walk their dog either does anybody have any advice weve had dogs for prettymuch all of the 38 years weve been married and for much of that time ive walked whatever dog we had typically a couple of times a day the one we have now is a 15 pound poodle  schnauzer mix hed be about as much protection as a steamed hotdog where we live now feels pretty safe at least as safe as anywhere is nowadays but for many years we lived in the heart of the twin cities and that never felt particularly safe although in retrospect i guess it was pretty good too the primary problem we had was with loose aggressive dogs so i always carried dog repellant and i had occasion to use it more than once i dont know about the knife idea sadly my impression is that when people carry something like that its more likely to be wrestled away from them  used on them than it is to end up being protective i dont know what type of community you live in obviously but my thinking would be that perhaps there are other people similar to yourself living in your neighborhood who would also like to have a walking companion so my thought would be to get the word out that youd like to find one or more walking companions  see if you cant find some you could perhaps talk to friends  neighbors even though you dont know them that well you wouldnt be asking to walk their dogs or anything like that you could also perhaps contact any community service or neighborhood associations in your area stuff like that you could perhaps even organize a walking club so to speak beyond that perhaps its primarily a matter of getting used to being outside walking start out just going as short a distance as youre comfortable with if thats only ten feet from your door then its only ten feet then each day try to go just a little bit further this is basically the idea behind what is referred to as exposure therapy family therapist kati morton has a video on the topic of exposure therapy on her youtube channel heres a link to that video ughhhhhhave to make a phone call tomorrow about getting the car fixed theres a problem with it thats been getting worse and my boyfriend found a recall that was done that should address the issue but i have to call because its my car and in my name etc i hate having to make calls like this they make me so anxious health anxiety continues daughter came down and talked to us about a pain in her back she has a curved spine and one hip higher than the other like me i just hope its a strained muscle and nothing worse hope she remembers to make a doctors appt except when i have to deal with the checkers at the local grocery store i try to avoid anyone i dont trust anyone anymore ive turned distant withdrawing into myself if someone were to do something as simple as even ask me the time i freak out i am in fear that people want to hurt me this is hell this is too much for me i hate bad environments were people are doing drugs  drinking to stupidity i hate gangs they hang out right outside the back of the bldg i live in with their stupid altar vigil going on one month burning little candles right on the property to their dead homey ill be blunt i dont care live by the gun die by it i just avoid it but those losers have people actually watch over the altarvigil thing how stupid isnt that what churches are for or peoples private homes oh and ill be more blunt if your uncomfortable than i suggest that you might go to another forum how come another ethnic minority i wont say which one why is it they call me a n rhymes with jigger when im light skinned  these losers are almost the same complexion they get treated with racism seems like blacks s should band together i guess that theyve aligned themselves with the aryan nation or something its dangerous being a black woman in 21st century america think im over exaggerating well do your research i know what im talking about in los angeles county blacks are killed for sport and ill leave it at that i really dont like this country if i could id go to hawaii fiji brazil after the horrible incident that happened to me on dec 13th by the psycho neighbor  other traumatic incidents i just dont view people the same anymore what a horrible world i live in in los angeles county blacks are killed for sport i didnt know that but find it disgusting i mean why hugs its understandable as to why you would feel this way it sounds like you have been through out a lot so it would make sense that you dont trust anyone  and yes the world is a terrible place sometimes and it can be very scary especially for minorities but the world can also be a great place to live in remember it takes one person to make a difference it may be scary now but take baby steps and treat yourself with care when you make progress towards your goal you should praise yourself for it i dont know you but i am rooting for you 3 i am soooo friggin angry right now i could spit nails my partner has no concept at how to have a relationship with someone  they resent me when i tell them that to have a healthy relationship you need to make time for each other and that does not mean a few hours inbetween picking up and dropping off her adult children everywhere they want to go because my partner is the family taxi 20 25 30 yr old adults should be making their own way in life and stop monopolizing the one parents time its been like this for 6 years that we have been together and it seems to be getting worse the oldest one stays 35 days in a row at the house when they figure out a way to manipulate and con their way at work to get multiple days off in a row they are not worried about getting fired because they dont pay any bills half the time they live with the mother and half the time they live with the father all rent and bill free chauffeur service door to door80 mile round trip 24 times a week for this 30yr old on top of it all the 30 year old is joined to my partners hip the minute they walk in the door listening to everyones conversations which often get brought back to the other separated parentthe 20 year old is driving 70miles round trip everyday to go to college because they are too friggin lazy to get up

yrs our dog is ready to pass he had been arthritic for the last year but now even with medication he has lost his back legs and is starting to piddle on himself we are only praying he makes it to christmas but if hes ready to go we wont let him suffer i am not even given the status of step parentso i have zero sayso im expected to just shut my mouth and except the way things are im going crazy i cannot talk to my partner and talking to a therapist at this time is too expensiveso im ventingthanks hello i really need to describe my experience here because i am not even sure if its valid not sure what is going on to be honest so here it goes about a year ago i had a cancer scare it turned out to be nothing the tumor i had was benign however it took so much time to diagnoze it and to rule out cancer months doctors even started preparing me that its cancer well it turned out to be benign at first i was happy but soon i started experiencing anxiety like i am not myself not completley i got easily irritated and full of anxieties and paranoia the fears not really connected to this but more related to my selfesteem or general anxiety etc i talked to a councelor last year and he told me that this is normal and that it will pass well one year later and i am still feeling off like i am still recovering from this trauma i am still anxious and getting paranoid and on the edge it even affects my relationship with my husband he is also feeling really stressed about the whole thing because it hurt him the health scare a lot and it affects him too so here we are more than a year full of anxieties like we just cant catch a break any mild annoyance and problem in life seems so big and stressful now so we are constantly feeling on the edge and all of that for nothing i mean i am healthy i should be happy right i know that rationally but i still feel off and like i am still recovering from the trauma not sure what to do thank you for reading this just like multiple octobers before i am becoming hypervigilant and listless suddenly everything fun in my life matters less every year this happens ive done every conceivable thing to combat seasonal depression but i dont think that is the issue i think its just a pattern of anxiety that my body responds to once the temperatures start to drop october is otherwise my favorite time of year  i am determined though not to just let the winter steamroll me again this year i need to take better care of myself and so far i have been so theres that im sending love and hugs my body seems to respond to autumn with increased depression and anxiety as well i look forward to the cooler temperatures and the beautiful autumn colours though oh smallnorth  i am so so familiar with this ive had two very similar episodes of suspected cancers that turned out to be nothing tests professional speculation preparation waiting andnothing then months and months of being on edge i really hope other people chime in here because there are a lot of directions this incident can take you now some people do get over it eventually and things do return to normal but these types of things shake our very foundations and a lot of us have our brains rewired after something like this life doesnt feel so safe anymore and part of the everyday anxiety is this vague feeling that anything at any moment can pop up and throw our lives back into chaos i hope i am not making this worse im trying to get the point across that sometimes these things do awaken a dormant disorder in us and it takes more than just time to heal i dont know what the next logical step will be for you but i feel like there should be more dialogue now between you and a counselor or therapist or whomever you can manage to talk with in this field i spent many years believing that sooner or later i would go back to normal so i didnt do anything about what was becoming a growing problem with anxiety i am doing better now with some various forms of therapy but i could have saved a number of years if i recognized this earlier good luck i really hope this doesnt sound catastrophic there is hope i promise quotesmallnorth5946265hello i really need to describe my experience here because i am not even sure if its valid not sure what is going on to be honest so here it goes about a year ago i had a cancer scare it turned out to be nothing the tumor i had was benign however it took so much time to diagnoze it and to rule out cancer months doctors even started preparing me that its cancer well it turned out to be benign at first i was happy but soon i started experiencing anxiety like i am not myself not completley i got easily irritated and full of anxieties and paranoia the fears not really connected to this but more related to my selfesteem or general anxiety etc i talked to a councelor last year and he told me that this is normal and that it will pass well one year later and i am still feeling off like i am still recovering from this trauma i am still anxious and getting paranoid and on the edge it even affects my relationship with my husband he is also feeling really stressed about the whole thing because it hurt him the health scare a lot and it affects him too so here we are more than a year full of anxieties like we just cant catch a break any mild annoyance and problem in life seems so big and stressful now so we are constantly feeling on the edge and all of that for nothing i mean i am healthy i should be happy right i know that rationally but i still feel off and like i am still recovering from the trauma to the validity i can speak yes it is i had serious back surgery last august  was told there was a chance i wouldnt wake up had to do with involved blood vessels so anxiety reared its head  understandable so wellobviously that didnt happen in fact the surgery was amazingly successful beyond what was considered possible during the month of inpatient care they kept me on the med got home stopped meds  the anxiety was still there only worse have an appointment w doc to find out whats going on a nurse friend suggested a possible medical reasonamygdala dysfunction long explanation so may want to research but it has to do with a brain chemical that may have gotten out of whack cuz of not only the mental stress but the physical stress of surgery thats all i kind of know so ill be following had a doc appointment today he is going to do some tests looking for a physical cause he said anxiety symptoms can be the result of excess thyroid hormone hormone imbalance often happens after surgeryhe says most times balance is restored without intervention fingers crossed quotesmallnorth5946265hello i really need to describe my experience here because i am not even sure if its valid not sure what is

i should be happy right i know that rationally but i still feel off and like i am still recovering from the trauma not sure what to do thank you for reading this quote i am terrified of the shower  no shower in almost 30 days  just sponge baths etc any one else out there with this awful phobia i do have a fear of showering but its manageable at the moment i use a 200 watt big yellow old school light bulb in my shower coz yellow light is soothing and it drives away the damp dark cold feel that dwells in the bathroom without it it also emits heat so thats an added benefit kind of like my own little sun in the bathroom next thing i do is exercise before showering nothing big just brisk half an hour walk does the trick it warms up the body so i stop feeling the chilly cold feel anymore every part of the body gets warmed up and then i can undress for shower knowing that i wont feel as much cold as i would have without the exercise i keep the water nice and warm and stored in plenty for as much as i need to use i wash with a gentle rinse of the loofah and lastly i always tell myself that whatever thoughts fearful or not come into my mind are just bathroom anxiety and i dont have to give them any second look and let them drift through me seamlessly i shower in the evening or at night when i know that i dont have to leave the house after so i can wrap my self in a warm blanket and immerse myself in the flow of the day hope some of it helps you hope it gets easier on you soon take care i have body issues and sometimes when i am under the shower i just want it over quickly so i can just put away my ugly body i also have a fear that if other women are about i am a woman myself i cant shower but thats okay because in most sinarios if not all i am home alone anyway resumed from anxiety daily checkin point 3  page 2  forums at psych central im feeling anxiety and i really need relief i guess i could have a cogentin it still isnt clear that the pharmacy will get my rx for me today i seriously need the prescription today oh god im so scared they seemed very certain they could fill the rx when i talked to them yesterday im just so afraid im sure its going to turn out just fine youll get your prescription filled today just like they told you try not to worry about that sending healing thoughts when i think about my therapist i feel anxious i miss her i didnt see her this week maybe thats why also since this is a therapy service offered by my university when ill finish uni and that is soon on february ill have to stop seeing her i think so this hurt me a bit because i think ill miss her even more i wish i could stay more plus i feel the same problems are with me everyday i need therapy having some panic this afternoon this is even with the artane which im about to run out of not sure what the deal is i was a little anxious about an interaction with my boss but i think its ok we have a weird relationship and i want to make it better hopefully she agrees my anxiety was much more bearable today i did get my meds yesterday and things seem more manageable i think i am prone to situations where something related to me like my prescriptions is not in my hands and i have to rely on other people thats probably what it is had a great day decided to be very busy so i wouldnt have time to think and it helped pretty excited to do the same tomorrow yeah sounds like everyone on this thread is doing well awesome im okay too soooo anxious about all the work i have to do for universityugh what if i cant complete it what if i dont pass its doing my head in i felt very anxious this morning and in the afternoon because my father screamed and argued all day with my mother i was very tense stayed in my room wanted to cut myself badly even if i promised to myself i wont do big cuts anymore then at some point the anxiety passed i felt anxious again for some minutes this evening i had to write my thoughts on my diary so i can show to my therapist i saved some thoughts i had on my phone so i only had to copied it on my diary i suddendly felt anxious a weight was on my chest when i took the diary because the diary made me think about my therapist im really afraid she doesnt like me and that she want to reject me i really think this was the reason for my anxiety i felt like i could panicked at any moment it was a huge anxiety i felt a weight on me i thought about hurting myself again instead i copied the thoughts on the diary then i drew a tree on a page and pressed hard the pen on the page then i drew causal lines to calm myself then put the diary away sat on my bed closed my eyes and breathed like i do when i meditate i tried to relax all my muscles and smiled a bit to relax the muscles on my face i counted my breaths after some breaths i started to feel less anxious until the anxiety passed and was tolerable for me now im really proud of myself years ago i would have hurt myself without thinking acting on the impulse to not feel my emotions instead i chose to feel my emotions and to accept them as they are they arent bad or negative and they come and go they will always pass like clouds in the sky another quiet day i didnt panic today made dinner and helped clean tomorrow will be busy pdoc t and picking up meds im in denial i can feel it physically even this was how i felt just before my best friend died its like a room where everything is covered by sheets of murky transparent vinyl its all tucked away for some future date when my emotions thaw it scares me was an ok but not great day dealing with some feelings that are going to make my life unpleasant until they pass but i think theyre the source of my extra anxiety of late knowing about them does make things more likely to be fixed i hope im wondering about this really awful rls ive been suffering lately just nothing helps it maybe an ativan will i guess ill try it out now i had to do some stuff outside my house for my mother groceries go to the pharmacist and i really didnt want to go because i felt too self conscious and anxious then i decided to go out and not avoid and i didnt felt so much anxious rough day husband was concerned about my a1c being up and told the pdoc i had changed my meds the meds arent the reason she put me on one that had one of the least amount of chances for problems then he clogged up the garbage disposal even after i told him putting that many potato peelings would do so my calmness has been spiked with anger my anxiety can go up when im angry just trying to take deep breaths now feeling extra whatever today boss hired a new guy and shes fawning and flirting with that guy so much right now the rest of us are  in her eyes lately her husband gets my sympathy so i have to listen to her cackle all day with this guy and it makes my anxiety go through the roof i really am thinking that quitting is the best option and they just gave me added responsibilities so id be walking away from a pretty good deal if i didnt feel like i was just garbage in my boss eyes i work there too and my career is going to go in the dumper without some help or input from her so yeah my day has sucked and now im worried about whats going to happen i went to my doctors appointment in spite of the heavy snow falling the doc was good and didnt give me the spiel about diet exercise and losing weight the hospital here has a diabetes eduction class so ill probably do that next month i also got a referral for an acupuncturist to see if they can relieve the pain in my back had a long wait for the diabetes med and almost hit another car on the snowy ride home traffic is backing up everywhere so its good to be home everybody was in good spirits so my anxiety stayed somewhat down i went out to do some things at the post office wasnt anxious maybe because i went out yesterday too and it was familiar for me plus people didnt care about me yesterday so today i was less self conscious i hope i can get some calmness back after days of anxiety tomorrow i plan to go to the library during my lunch hour it is peaceful to be immersed in a row of books i have to go out in an hour and go to the bank which is a place that makes me very anxious then ill go to a bookshop to buy a gift for my sister and this makes me anxious because im afraid the shop will be full of people watching me i was anxious earlier because their were meant to be some christmas carol singers heading this way and i didnt want them to stop at my door not that i dont like christmas carols people just make me anxious anyway the point is that they ended up not coming and it made me feel instantly better that i didnt have to possibly open my door to strangers did two loads of laundry and got my hair done im always anxious when i go to the hairdresser because my husband doesnt go in with me i trust the stylist enough so i dont panic but i feel uncomfortable it is only 10 am and i can hear fireworks i know they arnt their but even though i keep telling myself that i can still here them urg you just dont get fireworks on cold rainy mornings in december unlesss youre me and youre just ed up i spent all morning picking up meds and medical supplies have to order cpap supplies thursday a lot of waiting with a lot of people thankfully my husband was there so i didnt get too anxious still have more meds to pick up but it may have to wait until next year even though its wednesday i am a little anxious about sunday christmas day all this abandonment and being alone gonna cause problems went to pick up another med another 1 hours in the waiting room my fault though because i forgot the prescription yesterday other than that not much going on still nervous this afternoon im so anxious this morning ive gotten into this bad habit of only picking up my mail maybe once a week well its been more like 2 weeks now and i know i need to get it but since its been so long im really anxious about checking what i have had physical therapy and got the information to the sleep doctor so i can get my cpap supplies now its two days of waiting with nothing to do ughthis is when my anxiety gets really bad ive been doing okay but made the bad mistake of looking at the news today now im freaked out about nuclear war im scared for the future more dread today it comes in small bursts right now like getting your clothes snagged on some thorny bushes i can handle it for nowi just dont want to be enveloped completely was a mostly good day until this evening when i checked my work email got a less than warm response to my well wishes to my boss not mean just very meh i worry way too much about what she thinks of me and i wish i could stop at this point it feels so dysfunctional to deal with her everything else in life is generally pretty good but i catch her in an off moment which happen fairly often and my mood goes in the toilet and i spend the next day worrying constantly about it and how i can improve things really i dont think they can be but my mind races today is gonna be pretty challenging theres so much going on lately and the physical symptoms that anxiety is causing me have only gotten worse in the past few days i only managed to get 3 hours of sleep last night which is not helping ive been lying in bed for the past 2 hours but i really need to get up and start doing things soon my stomach hurts i want today to be over already i went with my father to shop for christmas dinner groceries thank goodness i wasnt alone we went at 7am and entered a relatively empty store but the crowd punched through the enterance behind us and i could just feel the tension of the whole store rise from the masses of stressed out shoppers thank goodness we got out but not before i witnessed a woman yelling at a clerk because they were out of the brand of cocktail sauce she wanted and two men arguing over placement in line it was bloody awful whew i got out of there relatively intact did a load of laundry and made dinner in the slow cooker other than that a quiet day my husband took my daughter to work cars were streaming outside of the mall trying to get in my daughter is not doing well emotionally and shes in a busy section of the department store i hope shell be okay tonight and tomorrow going to make cinnamon rolls in the morning and do our christmas dinner tomorrow night she is going to spend christmas with her boyfriends family which is fine with us i am quite anxious today  my cbt tools and decatastrophizing work is not helping in fact my catastrophic thinking has only gotten worse my daughter is making the drive out for the holiday it is a 7hr trip at the best of times but road conditions are crappy what with a blizzard yesterday and more snow to come all kinds of bad thoughts are going through my mind i slept terribly when i catastrophize this badly i envisage such distasters quite vividly i have seen in my mind images of her going off the road etc will it blizzard again does she have adequate tires on her car will she have an emergency kit including that for cold weather etc etc etc i know logically i shouldnt have my shirt in a knot its not like she is a kid anymore she is a big girl 29 and capable of making the right decision living where she lives she will have had plenty of winter driving experience regardless however i shall have my heart in my throat the entire day my holiday wont start until i get that call she has safely arrived im doing pretty well despite being broke for the next four days money is often a trigger for me so i chalk it up to having low stress in other areas of my life at the moment having some time off work is doing me good had a good christmas my husband surprised me so i have one less item on my wish list i have to save up some money for the last item and some accessories spent most of today puttering around i didnt get the usual midday anxiety so thats good however my daughters boyfriends mother made a bunch of sweets and i cant really have any because of diabetes so they need to go away somehow im very sad about some things but my anxiety has been very manageable the last week or so had a bit of a situation today but i was able to handle it also got a bit freaked out over some things that people did and said but was able to stop myself from getting too deep into it having less stress and some time off work and things to look forward to and just acknowledging that its okay to just breathe for a while has helped ive felt more calm and less depressed than i have been in a while i just want to say im grateful for all the brief check ins lately ive been very down and anxious and this thread is one of my safe places i feel comforted just knowing thee are others struggling like me i hope the best for you all im getting a new camera next week itll work with all the lenses i have my daughter is getting the old one as it is still in good condition plus some accessories i picked up for free hope i get to use it more next year i went to physical therapy this afternoon my back is put in traction for 20 minutes to relieve the pressure on the lower part of it i would be doing the exercises but i hurt my left shoulder blade at some point and its still very painful im doing alright anxietywise but i still need to drive and walk out on my own i havent done that yet plus i need to make some dietexercise plans because of diabetes still have a lot to be nervous about next year tend to feel jittery the start of a new year think its because i have relapsed so many times over the last few years i always thinkwill this year be the year i lose my  again dread i wish i could growl it away took down the outside decorations and the small tree in my home office i didnt want to take it down so soon but temps are supposed to drop below freezing in a few days ive been nursing a sinus headache that meds wont touch anxiety has been pretty low but i took a nap so i havent been up much the holiday took a pummeling to me my health crisis took a turn and was further dumped on by an infectiion keeping me in the emergency 11 hours boxing day followed by a ct scan on the 29th then my boyfriends daughter had a brain biopsy and was placed in a coma the 30th if that wasnt enough i find out now my father had a stroke on hte 31st when will this nonsense end i always feel ashamed of myself when anxiety hits im kind of out of it today things seemed to be unreal like im walking through life as a specter did go out today to take a family member to get groceries and to one of his friends houses and got some take out ive felt like there has been someone following me all day and i had to make sure no one was in the car that wasnt supposed to be there before i got in myself not really all that anxious or depressed today just feeling transparent and a little paranoid started back at work today after a little time off and noticed right away how much my anxiety is tied to my job i kept it in the background and hope it stays that way this week had my teeth cleaned today im doing the best i can but its not good enough still waiting for my cameraits supposed to be in today anxiety is cruising right along being at the dentist always makes me nervous anxiety is running high today but ive managed to control it a bit more than usual it is easier to deal with when im taking care of someone later i might have issue but right now im as good as i get im doing okay had physical therapy today and that went well still figuring out the camerathat will probably take a while had to update my medical id tags to add diabetes to the list anxiety is down so thats good where to start i am worried i am anxious i am depressed i am frazzled i am dissapointed resentful and agnry is the lithium withdrawal contributing i am irritable easily aggrivated and annoyed yes i have numerous very significant stressors in my life only one of which is my physical health to work me up these things if disclosed would be obviously extremely concerning to onlookers except apparently to my boyfriend i am quite sure others would acknowledge these situations and even validate my worry is understandable and expected despite the added situation of tapering off my lithium as adding to it all i think i am managing well i doubt even the average person would be able to cope i am hanging on i feel by a thread have three weeks of no physical therapy kind of nervous because my back started hurting again today had it on a heating pad for a couple of hours i hate to think this is going to fall apart had to go to the supermarket to pick up some food for the next couple of days i was fine until i got there i spent thirty minuets in the van and then another twenty minuets standing beside the drink machines before i could go in side went to the bathroom to calm down about half way through the trip and then finished up i tend to eat when im stressed and i ate too many potato wedges i feel like such a fatty surprisingly i feeling pretty good today last night was kind of a mess but today im pretty calm today was kinda of tense day maybe because i was tired i tend to overthink more when i am tired hoping the rest of the week is better i signed up for an online creative writing course im going to pick up poetry again since i can do that with all the diagnoses and such im going to see what im doing right and go on from there i may take some college courses and see if i can find a group of writers for mentorship and peer review did well the past few nights because i was with my friend but im back home and unable to sleep again texted my local helpline and talked to a very sweet girl and i feel better though still have a headache bless the volunteers there especially the late night ones i appreciate it so much that there are people willing to spend their 2 am counseling people for free it was a challenging day yesterday and it will be the same for today but i won some hard battles against anxiety yesterday i was able to attend and sit through a meeting ive been stressing about for weeks i was able to give my psychiatrist a form ive been panicking about giving him for near two months i was able to call my doctor about test results i stood up to the cable company thus far this morning ive finally made a few calls i have been putting off i was able to allow the cable guy into my home without freaking out and i had the courage to speak up to my boyfriend telling him i thought he was hurtful and inconsiderate whew learned how to use the blood glucose meter it still hurts and my meds got increased because my blood sugar was too high rather frustrating i didnt sleep well last night so i ended up taking a nap this afternoon im still tired and i need to stick myself again before dinner ugh im really struggling today im seeing my therapist for the first time after the holidays in an hour and im feeling so anxious the past 3 days were especially tough ive been constantly using selfdestructive behaviors because i can not cope with feeling like this but the truth is i only made things worse im trying to keep calm and take care of myself but i feel like im going to break down at any minute i just took 05 mg of lorazepam and im having a glass of warm milk i need to pull myself together quickly did grocery shopping and went to a meal planning class i was sort of anxious for both events but managed to get through them i picked up some yoga equipment i need more flexibility and i figure this would help my anxiety has really been taking over the last few monthssaw new p yesterday  have restarted my buspar  will continue my propranolol im glad that i feel strong enough to start fighting it again instead of letting it continue to control my life today was an off day for me had tension headache at work was better when i got home thank god tommorow is friday went to the emergency room tonight after looking up my symptoms they didnt help with my reason for going just set up a therapy appointment after we went through the questionnaire do u feel safe any thoughts of suicide blah blah im hoping that my symptoms are anxiety related so much ive had scares like this before but what if its for real this time another slow day i didnt do much i got my acrylic nails taken off since i wont be able to afford that anymore that was rather nervewracking other than that i ate and slept finishing up laundry here in a few and need to make dinner hi guys just got back from an embarrassing night lately i have been having a lot of worries about my upcoming dream trip and meeting with my girl crush during this trip being ruined by some brand new mental illness however this fear has been slightly more controlled though i did have a lot of other rocd obsessions about not loving my girl crush or falling out of love with her well lately the closer i get to my trip the more i worry that everything will be ok and i have been quite worried about ocd well tonight i had a dinner with my class at university but a bit before that i started to feel a bit sick i thought it was from the anxiety brought on by the obsessions then later on it persisted but i could still function then at some point after drinking one glass i started to feel more anxious and the fact that i was more anxious after drinking led me to having a bit of an anxiety attack then i really thought i was going to throw up which led me to panicking even more being emetophobic didnt help with this situation either i eventually ended up throwing up at some point in front of nearly everyone now i am quite worried and defeated if ocd really caused this then i am truly screwed  there really is no hope left for me i have learned to manage most of my symptoms through the 4 steps from brain lock but obsessive fears that are based on possible future scenarios are difficult to get rid of hello dannii thanks for sharing your experience honestly i dont know the answer to this but i wanted to at least acknowledge your post im not a mental health professional but anxiety is certainly something ive struggled with for many years and based on my own experiences it is my perspective that anxiety has a tendency to build on itself first you start to worry about something and moremore things get added to it then prettysoon youre worrying about the fact that youre worrying it can lead to the sort of thing you experienced i believe so it makes perfect sense to me from my own nonprofessional perspective that what you experienced was at least primarily the result of anxiety it may also be a red flag so to speak with regard to alcohol consumption assuming that is what you drank its difficult to say perhaps your anxiety would have caused you to throw up anyway its difficult to know anyway from what you wrote it sounds to me as though youve mostly just worked yourself up into a heightened state of anxiety over your upcoming trip perhaps sharing some of your nervousness  apprehension with your girl crush might help to alleviate some of your anxiety talking it through with someone else such as a trusted friend or your therapist if you have one may help too got to put on my brave face and go out today im a little anxious for my day to begin i hope it is a good day i hope yall have a good day too im curious about how many of you share this with me my anxiety causes me to do things and act a certain way one of those things is refusal to talk on the phone i would much rather text someone or hit up a chat roombecause typing is easier for me however when it comes to talking on the phonea lot of the time i will hit the ignore button on my cellphone and text the person asking them what they want i will hit the ignore button and not text that person at all i will let my work phone ring and refuse to answer it and when worse comes to worseif i absolutely have to talk on the phone i begin to stutter or my voice shakes my anxiety with phones began when i was a little kid i used to have a weird phobia of being woken up in the middle of the night to the house phone ringing and the answering machine picking it up i dont understand why i had that phobia i remember i would hold my fingers in my ears and cry until it stopped dont ask my why i was afraid of phones when i was a kid because to this day i still dont get it i have phone anxiety i cant even order pizza only very recently have i been tackling it i will never be a phone person but i want to at least be able to answer it and make appointments i have a hard time making calls this is a new development i wasnt always scared i hate talking on the phone as well my anxiety goes up everytime a family member calls me unexpectedly i wind up having to call them back because then i feel like i can handle it better same as thesadgirl i cannot do stuff like ordering pizza so i always order it online ironically right after i posted my comment some random number is calling me i have been getting a lot of random calls recently and have not answered a single one i remember a random number called me i answered it and a guy said hello mamthis is the  police department would you like to make a donation i was freaking out because i didnt know cops called asking for donations i said sure then he said which package would you like to pick there was a goldsilver and copper one i believe i said gold he said that will be 150 what is your credit card number i panicked and hung up i felt guilty afterwards i have really bad anxiety about unknown numbers calling me my paranoia goes crazy i have it too i often choke when talking to a stranger ive read that this fear comes from the fear of making a mistake the more we will practice and make mistakes learn from them and repeat the process the better we will get at it think of your next phone conversation as an opportunity to practice and learn i guarantee you will feel less anxious do that for every call and you will overcome this fear thats my take on it could it be that the avitan actually has helped and is just kicking in i felt miserable around an hour ago cast good sense into the wind took one and now i feel almost as good as a kpin could make me although i possibly have more anxiety now or maybe the anxiety just wasnt helped by this pill i dont know what to say now whatever it is its maybe 5 to 10 of what a kpin could do for me i want to crawl into a deep dark silent place and cry so much for that wave of relief anxiety is washing over me again the information i got from my family doctor did not reflect the latest results and thus was incomplete i have it too i hate talking on the phone if i have to make a phone call i go to a room where nobody is in and make sure there is no sound so i dont have to worry about having a hard time hearing i much rather text somebody i have a hard time responding to any kind of communication in general from anyone besides like my mom i worry so much about how my response will be taken that it keeps me from responding in a timely fashion i am working on it though learning to overcome my fear seesaw a little edgy today and i dont really want to go out but looks like im going to have to make a grocery run did a load of laundry and wrote another poem im going for at least one poem a day anxiety was up but i managed a nap so it passed im not doing so well lately im trying to keep myself busy during the day and ive accomplished a few tasks i feel proud of this week but im finding it extremely hard not to isolate myself i get so anxious when im around people and i dont even want to talk with my friends it takes me several days to text them back and i spend hours thinking about the fact that i need to text them even if i dont which only makes me more anxious im isolated and anxious it was a rough day couldnt help cleaning because of my back which made me feel worthless i did well on dinner though i really want to text the hotline but i texted them two nights in a row already  my friend insisted on picking me up after therapy this evening i have a difficult session coming and i wanted to be alone and clear up my mind but shes going to be busy these days and she tried to make some time for me so i couldnt say no plus i cancelled going out for dinner with her the other day because it felt like a huge challenge i felt better after cancelling it but now i feel like im being ungreatful its gonna be long day and im really anxious about the appointment with my therapist i wanted to be home early today but it seems like its not gonna happen i have to be really careful with my anxiety leves at night time so i only hope i can manage to end the day in a good way now im just trying to keep myself busy so i dont think about it too much i find it hard to take naps because then i cant sleep at night i have to admit i take them anyway because im soo tired from my meds i am sitting here with my anxiety going through the roof i needed to get rid of my clunker of a car maybe i could have sold it but my anxiety would never allow me to give strange people my phone number and address so i am taking the miserable token fee the wrecker has offered and now await his arrival i cant help but think this is going to go badly my catastrophic thinking is getting the better of me why am i so blanketyblank afraid of this wrote some poetry and took a shower husband is making dinner tonight i like being able to switch around as cooking is stressful to me other than that my anxiety is up and im not doing much i felt blue and super anxious earlier but after a nap i feel a little better had a pretty alright day i was able to eat in fact i think i overate nowim feeling the consequences with heartburn on top of my normal anxiety stomach aches before bed but trying to stay calm since the stomach aches trigger the anxiety a lot gonna try not to bother anybody about it tonight not my friends not my mom not the hopeline and just meditate or something i am struggling today yesterday i had a terrible anxiety attack i was seriously afraid my heart would fail it was over a situation i knew full well i need not be afraid of but my catastrophic thinking got the better of me i retreated to my apartment and hid in my bedroom for hours afterwards today i nearly had one again i had to make a difficult phonecall one necessitating i stand up for myself in a likely confrontation and that it did come to oh how confident i must have sounded with my voice trembling an octave higher and barely able to hold the phone i cried and i cried once the call came to an end in a release of all the fear still will there be retaliation it never ends i hate this i hate this anxiety i hate this illness went to a park and took pictures it was rather nice came home had lunch and the anxiety started up i was late to take my meds and im still quivering couldnt focus on anything so came to pc need to start forcing myself to spend time with friends and leave my room when im at home i just wanna be alone but its making people think i dont like them or care about them or whatever my anxiety has been high lately my ex is taking me back to

couldnt make myself do it i have my own plate of worries those of my boyfriends crises add to them my latest worry i am concerned that he may lose his job it would seem his overwhelming anxiety and depression resulting from all the worries of his own is affecting his performance he told me he has been getting coaching conversations lately i am doing my best to be supportive as ive mentioned over and over but my catastrophic thinking is kecking in i am procrastinating one of my worksheets to deal with this was kept up all night with racing thoughts so i didnt have that good of a day i did get four poems out though so that was a plus didnt work on my pictures and only got one load of laundry done hopefully will be better tomorrow i dont want to go to town tomorrow but looks like im going to have to go really sucks because i dont like all the traffic or the people really really dont wont to go grocery shopping i can kinda do okay to the first of the month on raman noodles and kool aid but everyone else is so  picky ive been extremely anxious since yesterday i feel like im choking shaking and about to vomit any second i wish i could unexist until this passes its 9 am right now where i am im waiting for a reasonable hour to call my doctor ive been on sertraline for 2 weeks and this is the first time ive felt so bad since i started using it i feel terrified i got reasons to worry like everyone does but i feel i wont be able to handle them anymore i feel overwhelmed by responsibilities and uncertainties this may sound stupid but my anxiety elevated because of the kittens in out buildings yard ive been feeding them getting them spayed looking after them for a few days at home and then putting them back to the yard this was going smoothly until the cats made a habit of entering the building and pooping whenever they cant find a way out the janitor took them and left them somewhere unsafe in a moment of rage before but i was able to bring them back and inform the neighbors so that they wont let the cats inside but still some people invite them in and the same thing happens last night the janitor came and complained and demanded that id do something about it i think i handled it pretty well i offered to put cat litter somewhere in case they are trapped inside the apartment the janitor accepted my offer but still i feel like they are gonna be taken any moment and i wont be able to help them i got the rest of the laundry done today but not much else anxiety is walloping me only eked out one poem i think i put it in the creative corner still havent worked on photos my t saw my poetry site and left a compliment guess that means its therapyapproved then i still have not received my script for gabapentin its approaching a bad time because ill be out of the emergency pills the pharmacy gave me i just hope ill have excellent luck tomorrow anxiety is beginning to mount i had been doing better in the past few weeks but now im struggling again im back at taking ativan small doses 34 times a day and its come to a point where its not working anymore i called my pdoc today and now im waiting for her to call me back so we can set an appt and talk about this i dont know everything feels overwhelming lately wait wait wait the game continues today could be a pivotal day this week could be a big week my lease is up in a matter of days and ive yet to hear from my property manager will they drop in my lap a rent increase what would the implications be for my eligibility for my benefits what about my ct scan assuming my results were in when my specilist returned to her office on monday and assuming the woman again infuriatingly has sent me results by mail i could receive that correspondence as early as today i wont hold out hope i am waiting for a cheque from the wrecker for the car i had dragged to the lot will he follow through on his quote and what of my military disability application will my psychiatrist finally have completed the questionnaire will he confirm that the assualts ptsd and harrassments contributed to my mental illness sigh i really wish i could try some medication for my anxiety and panic attacks my doctor flatout refused last time i asked about it things are tough at the moment  i wake up very early in the morning having a panic attack and it is so horrible it makes studying so difficult and i wish i could have a better hold on this going to keep going though gymnastics helps to quiet my mind my daughter went to the er last night they think she may have an ulcer which wouldnt be surprising she has anxiety and depression shes on meds for 5 days and hopefully shell pull through if she doesnt then she needs to see a gi specialist finished processing my photos and up them up on flickr i did a different take since there arent that many birds squirrels and chipmunks there were turtles though and that was quite a surprise i am anxious about my daughters mental health omg i called the help line and poured out my feelings about having no job or future and the girl really told me to go join the military then she started debating me about donald trump and how great he is because i said im worried about whats gonna happen to my family who are on obamacare some people shouldnt be allowed to volunteer id really better start getting up before 8am i have things coming up and for some reason i cant even get up lately again woke up from crazy dreams feeling really anxious took me a while to get out of bed and go downstairs to face the day thank god the feeling lessened and i managed to do a bit of studying my exam is on monday so could be why i am feeling so jittery didnt do much today back still hurting im seeing my doc and pt tuesday so i hope to hold out until then other than that writing more poetry and surfing the web im starting to get anxious now that the weekend is almost over i should be hearing from my dr monday about my thyroid test im really hoping theres a problem with it but i dont feel like thats very likely anymore back is feeling betterdidnt bend as much yesterday posted a lot of poetry to my wordpress site wrote a couple more my daughter is following along doing a drawing a day i dont know if shes posting hers or not whatever its keeping us going making tacos tonight something quick and easy that everyone enjoys didnt do much today besides walking outside i feel a bit uncomfortable that im feeling hot and i know that is because of stress and tomorrow is my birthday been mostly having a good few days i start therapy again next month had a weird moment but im calming down gonna try some mindfulness i have to remember my friends birthday tomorrow i keep forgetting every important thing and i need to make myself take walks okay this post is weird bye well i am still not recovered last night i experienced a really bad anxiety attack the physical symptoms were so strong i nearly went to the emergency room this was building i think since friday i went to a large function and found myself in a situation of sensory overload sounds sights even smells and a crowded situation i could not escape from battered me emotionally i couldnt get away worry over some undercurrents in my life over the weekend added to the build up of angst last night i was taken to dinner it was one of those very busy restaurants where you stand in a very long crowded line too much was going on  crying infants unsupervised misbehaving children teenagers playing the crotch grab game intoxicated college students and several people having a disturbing racist conversation finally we sat down but the crowd noises and specifically the inability to anticipate peoples behavior took its toll i ate two bites of my food before asking to leave i had to escape i was dropped off home and immediately went for a lie down i woke up with my mind running amok and my heart pounding so hard i was afraid it would burst or have an attack i thought i might die sorry to hear that justafriend306 happy birthday made08 typical slow day woke up early to get lab work done only to find out that the doctor didnt put in the order so we will discuss this tomorrow went to t didnt discuss much other than a book im reading want to get my t to read it other than that the usual i slept through lunch wrote a poem about my childhood threw up last night so i missed my friends birthday dont know from what but i feel fine now had a bad panic episode about it thinking it had to be an allergic reaction but i dont think it was really want to go to my friends house tomorrow but im afraid of being contagious to her still after 2 days my sister caught what i had and threw up too so i dont know so much better but still a bit edgy of all the things that ive been waiting on that have caused so much anxiety these last few months i received another good news item in yesterdays mail my parathyroids are good  no surgery i am down to waiting on one matter that is giving me serious grief i still have to hear from my property manager i felt like i am going to have a panic attack all day its all building up and stuff but not really happening horrible feeling managed to sleep better the last couple of nights so feeling a little more rested the no sleeping thing really wears me out i think ive accepted the reality of what happened it still feels really strange and a little surreal especially being at the doctors the other day i am afraid i wont be able to handle it all i have to remember to take it one day at a time otherwise ill go mad anxiety seems to be building its very dark in my place due to the lights fading i hope theyll stay on until my friend can be here to install fresh bulbs but other than that i have free falling anxiety i just remembered i took an ativan earlier today  thats why i napped i guess  went to pt this afternoon have appointments with dermatology and the dentist made lunch and will be making dinner in a little while wrote a couple more poems and added one to the creative corner couldnt nap because of pt and lunch im still anxious but took some meds to hopefully knock it down i hate this midday anxiety super anxious about the next couple of days but grateful i dont have to do the driving thank goodness looking forward to it being behind us and back at home i had a panic attack yesterday and ended up throwing up i missed my meds not doing that again ive been trying really hard to manage my anxiety over politics lately im hoping the new meds will help theres a big tight ball in my stomach that never unknots itself im hoping for it to go away and let me breathe again went to pdoc shes giving me vitamin e for possible tardive dyskinesia before she increases my artane went for a walk at a local park feels more like spring than winter was tired because i didnt sleep well so i missed t will still see him next week had some anxiety so i took another vistaril seems to help the anxiety paralyzes me it can be anything last week the mail piled up because i couldnt bring myself to open it not even the junk mail there is nothing to fear about the mail i can pay my bills im not expecting bad news when i was able to force myself to open the mail the effort exhausted me god i went into the music store today to ask about violin rentals and my voice wouldnt come out right i knew what i had to say but ended up coming out like d do yuooou guyss uh do the uhhmhm violin rental things at here or something the poor lady who had to talk to me oh my god probably thought i was so weird i sounded like i was about to cry the whole time im so sick of this  if i could just talk normally i would have a lot less anxiety but i know wvery time i go up to the cash register or something and my throat starts tightening up im about say somehing like uuhh uhh uh can i ggget a ccccoooffeeee or nothing will come out and i will make some horrible voice cracking noise since ive been revisiting cbt via a guided journal of assignments it has been getting easier for me i still have the anxious thoughts like catastrophic thinking but i am beginning to challenge and strategize wins against them went to pt today 20 minutes of traction my back feels fine the recumbent stationary bike came in pretty neat now need the yoga stuff i didnt feel well most of today so i slept a lot still pretty tired anxiety was down but i was down as well actually it has improved a great deal since i started to revisit cbt i suppose i had fallen off of the daily homework since the program was completed i found a great cbt journal im on week 2 which is full of daily assignments that is renewing the strategies and coping skills i had shelved away the journal includes tasks guided writings selfassessments and worksheets now i admit having already gone through the therapy program it is easier to complete these assignments as i am in the right mindset to do so and am out of choice and not because i ought to anxiety is sky high today im making some major decisions and cannot stop thinking if im making the right ones you wont be judged i promise everyone is ed up everyone has their own flaws no one is going to overlook their own just to judge you for yours i think im mentally stuck in 6th grade when it comes to guys because i left public school in 6th grade from the anxiety and live with only girls every time i have to talk to a guy my age i get so flustered and confused i dont even find them attractive just wanna get the hell out because i have no idea what to say or do around them when i go to the cash register and its a guy its like i was on a nature walk and suddenly came face to face with a grizzly bear like do i stay still do i run is it hungry lol gotta get through tomorrow and i hope i will be feeling better after that took daughter to an indoor aquarium for her birthday yesterday i had some anxiety but got through it she had a lot of fun today was quiet went to pt and picked a roasted chicken for meat got anxious inside the home office so came out to the living room instead not sure what ill do tomorrow so i suffer from anxiety and depression with ptsd fall is the worst time of year for me and like clockwork i fell in a dark hole in september sad seasonal affective disorder has long been a problem my dr and i upped my meds the end of september and about four weeks ago i noticed how calm i am so now im worried about how calm i am and heres why i was promoted at work over the summer and have a lot more responsibility i now have just under 100 people indirectly reporting to me i should be doing a million things but i tend to do as little as possible throughout the day somedays just surfing the net and reading posts on here my motivation is shot i know the sensible answer is to lower my meds but i want to hold off until after the holidays now keep in mind that i was having serious self harmingsuicide thoughts just a couple months ago so i need to find a balance where i have a little edge to push me at work anyone else experience something like this sometimes too much meds can have a flat effect when i dont feel anything i found that a seasonal light i forgot what its actually called is useful but i cant do too much because of bipolar 10 minutes a day is good enough my meds were upped too but im now groggy during the day and have insomnia at night i have a job interview in the morning which is good because its a lot of people my age and i will have responsibility but its also bad because its a lot of people my age and i will have responsibilty went to t and did some grocery shopping wrote a poem tried another book for learning one of my programs tried to napdidnt happen hard time focusing because of the anxiety almost missed my afternoon meds going to make dinner here shortly daughter is home all week so i need to plan my meals accordingly for the last three days my anxiety has been sky high i cannot do anything without having some sort of anxiety attack which makes me in a state of continuous irritation which in turn causes me headache we made pumpkin pancakes for breakfast i got surprised with a card and flowers i went to pt for my back had a small lunch and then went to a nature reserve took quite a few pictures came home and awaiting dinner my husband is roasting cornish game hens yum anxiety was up and i almost didnt go outside today i took my meds late because of breakfast but im starting to calm down now i went out although its cold i swear i didnt know where i was walking i was just looking at my feet i didnt look at any one in the face now i feel worse than before i went out picked up most of my meds today two wont be available until next week but i should be okay wrote a poem about it had a temporary crown put in this afternoon will get the permanent one in a week and a half felt like the dentist was going to drill all day thank goodness i was numbed up right now im resting kids are making dinner tonight thats cool i am having problems staying in my home office i dont know why im feeling anxious in there i have that interview in the morning im just thinking of sll the ways it might go wrong and how im gonna look stupid and ugly trying to make myself sleep but imagining things exploding or catching on fire while im sleeping also afraid to talk anout it because of the fear of talking things into existence but im trying to get past it therefore posting about it the couselor im seeing is starting to get on my nerves giving me worksheets to fill out i just want to talk had pt again today the tech said half my body weight which is a lot of tension put up cooked breakfast sausage and picked the game hens from valentines day i have two cups of meat so thats good went to another park with a waterfall it was running this time so ill have some cool pictures going to make dinner in a bit had some anxiety when we went out but it diminished with the exercise struggling with anxiety and resentment in regards to trying to maintain a clean home trying to be perfect im so overwhelmed right now i almost want to cry my heart is racing feeling on the verge of a panic attack i try and i try and my son just destroys it all i havent seen a clean home in years i have my license and have been driving for over a decade but a while back some trauma busted into my life and my anxiety went through the roof and i found myself unable to drive for over 8 months i would sit in the passenger seat as my husband would drive me and i would have panic attacks and feel like i was about to die it was horrible i did some counseling and started driving myself to the store that is in our town and small things like that and little by little i would stretch out the distance until i could drive whenever where ever with no issues so hang in there and keep increasing the distance just by a few blocks each time but i think it would be wise if you got your license first in case there were ever an accident or you got pulled over but stay strong and youll get there good luck getting your drivers license i agree with gradually building up to driving longer distances it hit me big time today that you dont have to feel confident to take action i am not 100 sure why but i seem to operate under the illusion that you have to feel confident before you can act with confidence big mistake thats not how things work this is a component of anxiety avoidant behavior such as procrastinating for me feel the fear and do it anyway is a good mantra avoiding things out of fear of failure embarrassment wasted effort whatever leads to a lack of experience what does more experience give a person confidence eventually becoming more competent at something comes from repeated practice and observing what works for you becoming competent increases confidence that sounds good i was nervous bringing it up last night but i confronted my brother about one of his strange rules that he put in place a few years back that i feel is a violation of my rights i also dropped the i with him and called ourselves we because it the truth and im tired of hiding it i dont care anymore if he doesnt want to hear it or shakes his head about it as though it makes no sense im the sufferer and have a right to refer to myselves as we are after all these decades its finally coming out im becoming assertive and you know what i like it it doesnt just feel good it feels right i agree with you been having a lot of anxiety lately i am considering telling people about my mental health issues but am reluctant because of the stigma i woke up in a good mood and did chores in the morning but in the afternoon i felt anxiety come on and off and now im just trying to relax i went to t but cut it short because of the anxiety came home and took an extra vistaril to calm down i hate it when that happens i ended sleeping part of the afternoon managed to wrangle out another poem at least i can make dinner tonight i hope went to pt and dermatology for the rosacea on my face the pa gave me some creme to get the redness to go down and listed some otc products i can use also picked up a couple of meds the latuda may not be in until tomorrow but the pharmacy tech said they will call me had anxiety again so i took more vistaril its not really helping i may have to take more neurontin or artane well see i feel really shaky inside and im restless which is often one of the signs that im really anxious but it isnt something stupid im just really worried rough day today ended up with anxiety attack so i just laid down and rested didnt get much done need to take shower and make dinner i may ask my husband to pick up something instead i have had high anxiety today mostly about my health and not finding a job had anxiety again today i thought being out and about would help but no it didnt took some more vistaril and am trying to calm down im okay for nowlets see how ill do at worklast night was awfuli forgot the keys for my work and felt like a failurestill dotbh had anxiety this afternoon started when h came back from his pdoc tried to sleep but couldnt i did manage t this morning and did write three poems starting dinner soon but kids wont be home until later tonight anxiety is high for no apparent reason i couldnt concentrate while reading something to improve my skills i just realized how serious my anxiety has been well i went for my job orientation today and then the person who was supposed to help me suddenly left so i had to sit there for an hour feeling weird until a new manager showed up when the place opened but after that my coworkers seem nice even though intimidating im trying to just live in the moment and stop worrying about the future or analyzing everything that im doing idk the point of this post hope everybodys doing well trying to sleep and i start imagining im underwater and that theres a huge fish swimming towards me anxiety is improving i still get super high anxiety but it comes and goes my anxiety basically has its highs and lows previously it was stuck for months at the peak much of this was circumstantial some of it was catastrophically thinking everything in my life some of this i think was just being in a general mood of anxiety to begin with im not sure what changed perhaps it is the cbt journalling selfhelp book i began a month ago i certainly have a better outlook however when those periods of anxiety do hit they are pretty debilitating i feel like i have a molten ball of wax in my a gut and im very twitchy today i cant even point to any one reason why i feel this way today its not like i have to go anywhere or be around people about the only thing i am worried about is going to my support group tomorrow night 1 i dont much enjoy it since the dynamic has changed 2 it is in a not very nice part of town and i hate coming fromtowaiting for the bus the stop is midway between a hooker stroll and a shelter in the dark 3 it is effing cold out 4 i am not one of the popular crowd at the meeting listening to the incrowd discuss what they have done the previous week together and making plans for the following is not only hurtful but downright rude i feel so bad about myself at these meetings they arent any longer the most supportive so why do i go i go there because someone has to be supportive to the rest of the unpopular crowd i feel as though i am needed some of them turn to me for some sense of leadership took more vistaril than usual to get through the day had pt and a new crown put in thank goodness i told the dentist to numb that part of my mouth even with the anesthetic i was in quite a bit of pain i wrote two poems and worked on getting my photo printer set up right my rls isnt too bad right now but im not able to sleep yet i want to but im too wakeful the rls has gotten worse since it always does later at night i wish i had been able to fall asleep sooner but i still dont think i can i hope you manage to sleep not slept at all this week almost making it another whole week without sleeping today was quiet trying to get my photo printer to print right and its rather annoying i also wrote a poem for my online class but for the most part ive been asleep i missed marinating the chicken for dinner so i have to think of something else my anxiety was up even with the extra vistaril so i took a nap rather bummed out overall really overthinking starting the job tomorrow im gonna have to make so many first impressions it is peaking pretty high right now ive had a wonderful relatively anxiety free few weeks lately but today it shot through the roof recent circumstances will likely result in the rent going up i can barely justify where it is now not anxious this morning because i just woke up every morning i am hopeful that ill be productive and then it almost never happens and i get anxious and sometimes have panic attacks i feel good about today though my husband and i went to his presurgery appt he wanted it done as soon as possible it means i have to be able to drive soon and i cant get him out of his man cave to do that had anxiety at midday so kept doing errands through it tried to take a nap but couldnt starting dinner soonit should be pretty quick also got jury duty notice handed the paperwork over so pdoc can write an excusal letter alright i finished my first shift everyone was really nice even though i kept messing up and didnt talk that much i think this is going to be okay my anxiety peaked yesterday with some serious catastrophic thinking the property manager is adding some seriously needed security to the building exterior doors of course the first thing that i jump to immediate conclusions about is that this will result in a rent increase aewga the alarm is sounding off like a klaxon in my head i have done some cbt work on this and the panic is subsiding to what i will call a raised level of concern moderate today feels bad but i know how much worse it can be too many things swirling around in there to choose from i think i will feel a little better if i get to the laundrymat had t and physical therapy today we discussed various things in t but i dont remember much of it just floating like a butterfly on various topics my t is happy that my creative spark is coming back but it takes a lot of work to write a poem every day theres not much else the physical therapist can do for my back i see my pcm next month so i may ask for pain management again i only have problems when i bend now so at least theres some improvement he ordered xrays and a mri on my back though i started working in my web design program again i have a call with a friend tomorrow i may ask her for help with my web site after i upgrade it i dont think she can help me with selfpublishing my poetry and i really would like some more insight maybe go back to school and learn some things i dont know i didnt have much anxiety today so that was good my anxiety has been stable these last few weeks oh i still have peaks but for the most part it has levelled off and not been constantly high today though is one of those sudden peaks it is a whiteout today with powerful winds and frigid temperatures i have one errand in particular that i am afraid that if i dont take care of it that it will cause me some trouble i realise i am overly concerned about it but my thinking is black and white it is so bad out there however that the news is pleading with people to stay inside i take a bus talked to my friend and we have some good ideas i felt anxious after the call though i have to add a blog to my web site im okay writing poetry but i dont write a lot for a blog other than that not much happened been working with my web site program for most of the day realizing that im doomed to be unhappy forever hate any form of work i know thats like a baby thing to say but its true any job no matter how fun or easy it is feels like im trapped there i already hate my new job even though theres nothing wrong with it and everyone is so nice and laid back i hate the idea of having to be somewhere under someones eye for 6 hours a day i wonder if i got a real job if i would feel different but i dont see the point in getting my ged and going to college with the money i dont have if im gonna feel the same way idk went to pick up meds including the ativan for my mri next week thats going to be fun at least ill be in the tube for a halfhour it was too nice to clean house today and itll be too cold tomorrow to go outside so were cleaning the house tomorrow we went to a park we go to a lot all the critters were out so we took a lot of pictures will hopefully be done with them tomorrow or saturday depending on how much cleaning we do my daughters boyfriend has a cold so hopefully we all dont get sick soon anxiety started early this morning had to take some vistaril to calm down thankfully i didnt need more later today bed bugs yes these are always a concern for me a few years ago my building had them and it took two months to fully eradicate it is something constantly on my mind as since then ive had the practise each morning of checking for bites and scrutinising my mattresses my anxiety is spiking right now as a pest control vehicle is sitting parked in front of the building across the street i am in abject fear right now that these effing things will march on over across the street another spike to my anxiety i have a function to go to this weekend for my boyfriends group i have trouble with names and faces i am terror stricken by the idea someone will start talking to me and i have no clue who they are after 2 12 years i cant very well ask them to remind me or their name i dont know why im so anxious today though its pretty obvious its because of my new job i really cant find anything negative about it and i already know most of the people who work there and were all close everything should be perfect but its not did a lot of housecleaning today the house needed it when you have two people pursuing their passions the house takes a hit went to see my pastor today he gave me leads for a couple of volunteering opportunities so i appreciated that we also chatted for a while which was nice started feeling anxious around noon but i had an errand to do so i focused on that hopefully i wont have jury duty my anxiety has been really bad the last few weeks i keep over thinking things getting stressed and upset at what i think the outcome will beat the people involved my grandmother is very sick im the only grandchild out of six that comes to visit i keep thinking shes going to die and my sister and cousins will show up at her funeral then i effing snap on them didnt finish cleaning  husband was sick but i put my last batch of pics up on flickr and sent in a poem for my churchs quarterly magazine waiting to see how the latter goes going to make dinner soon hopefully everybody will be able to eat nobody has been feeling good today had anxiety at midday as usual rested for a couple of hours until it passed im so tired of this feeling anxious today have to write my boss an email on monday and i keep ruminating over something she saidarghhh why do we have to overthink so much p and than my kid is pushing my buttons today too but other than that life is good  wasted this day went to church came home and slept all afternoon didnt get anything done now trying to get the energy to cook dinner dont know why im so tired now ive gone about 3months without my medicine since i left my state to help a family member and ive reached my limit and my anxietyagoraphobia has begun to come back the poem i sent in for the church magazine was approved happy about that i almost finished building my web page on my computer so i should be putting it up online in the next day or two i wouldve done it today but anxiety hit again so i put it off have an mri tomorrow its a closed tube so that will be fun i definitely have a curved spine and some of the disks have degenerated further have ativan will travel i guess didnt get the site up yet need to add a few plugins so im waiting on that going to the hospital shortly to have the mri done i dont know why they scheduled this so late anxious about my therapy appt today i am unsure as to whether it is helping im doing selfhelp dbt workbooks and selfcare daily im hung up on therapyexpensive and id rather be with my family mri went fine my head was actually sticking out the other end of the tube so i wasnt as nervous as i thought i would be today was mostly spent in bed i woke up really late i did some work on my web site and have two plugins done the third may have to wait until i have more money i had to drop off my daughters wallet at her work and ended up buying some clothes that i did need no anxiety today because of the running around i feel better waiting to see how tomorrow ends up finished the web site today opened a new facebook page need to do twitter and instagram if i can figure out instagram will be doing taxes tomorrow will see if we can actually not be so far in the red also have church anxiety was down because i kept busy my tv still isnt working i dont think its the fault of the tv i think those creeps from the cable tech support messed it up its been over a week thats not working then cable was here working fine then the cable ppl were here and it worked all afternoon only to suddenly stop working in the night time i dont know what to say to tech support if i call them i just dont know spent most of the day wound up at the hospital husbands surgery went well but a thunderstorm rolled through while i was picking up his meds thankfully it was over when i drove home got there and home okay going to spend a few days relaxing still anxious but also exhausted had my first panic attack in a long time 2 nights ago but my mom helped me through all of it and held me and talked to me until i fell asleep i am so thankful to have her love her so much today i went back to work and got to know my coworkers better and i adopted another snake woke up with pain in my lower back been kicking all day probably need to go back to the hospital but with my husband recovering from surgery i wont have any support friends are too busy was anxious around midday so took a nap for a few hours didnt sleep well last night because my feet were too hot a bit grumpy at the moment due to the pain naproxen wont help may try a heating pad but im overheating now as it is this week i have had 2 panic attacks for no reason at all 1 on sunday afternoon and 1 at 3 am this morning as i say i have no idea why because currently i cant think of anything that could have triggered them i used to have anxiety its terrible but i dont have thinking must destroy it when i know buddhism one half of the anxiety has been lifted the phone i ordered was in stock and has now been shipped the other half remains intolerable now the waiting game of when will it arrive went to the base pharmacy to pick up meds i already filled two last week and one was a duplicate so i actually didnt have that many to pick up finished my blog post on resilience and posted it i think i rambled a bit but oh well other than that not much happening need to take a shower and make dinner soon anxiety is hitting now so i might lie down had bad anxiety today now slipping into depression my back still hurts and my husband keeps trying to do stuff he shouldnt be doing hes pretty hopped up on percocet now so i have to keep telling him to sit or lie down he doesnt like not helping but they had to cut through some abdominal muscle to repair his hernia so he cant do a lot and this will take at least four weeks to heal so im doing a lot more things

took meds and lied down for an hour that seemed to help today i had a panic attack because my train was delayed managed to calm myself down while still waiting anxiety went back up because we were packed in like sardines when it finally did turn up had to stim hand flicking for the next 20 minutes to control the panic till i reached work somehow managed to be on time today my anxiety is as high as it has been in months our eldest son is currently delusional and it has me on edge we live in another state but i am still concerned that he will find a way here and hurt us he has a history of violence when his thoughts get this way which adds to my anxiety i am afraid that he is either going to hurt us or himself i pray not and i pray that my anxiety level will drop a bit because i hate being in this constant state of fight or flight been busy today went to t and mainly talked about my husbands surgery and my progress driving we also talked about the new pictures i added picked up groceries from three places went with my husband to see the psych nurse then went to pick up a skirt a couple of tshirts and some blue shoes now im ready for reading at church next month wrote a poem

some nervousness early this afternoon will be seeing pdoc tomorrow so will bring this up again just woke up i dont feel any anxiety thank you lord i hope it lasts i have a lot to do today in my worst section of anxiety in my life i had a huge panic attack at the end of january and just never felt i could recover i had to change therapists due to insurance and went on meds for the first time ever i was given buspar which has plagued me with lits of side effects the past 2 months had periods of feeling better but this past week i stumbled hard ive had a panic attack every day the last 3 days i was able to get into mybpcp yesterday and he switched me from the buspar which has clearly not been working to paxil and he renewed my script for xanax in the meantime i barely alept last night and am just so tired im really hoping the paxil provides me some relief the last few days have not been good i usually respond with anxiety to specific events or situations but of late i have just been anxious in general i have woken up anxious with a sense of impending doom which lasts throughout the day i have gone to bed early just to be rid of the horrible sensation i cant sit still i cant remain in one place i cant stop trembling i am afraid something bad will happen im afraid to answer the phone afraid to check my texts and emails im afraid to get my mail im even afraid to watch news and programming on my television hung out with friends for the first time in weeks tonight it was nice and i laughed a lot didnt spend the night because its too much for me but im happy i did something other than go to work and sleep went to another store this morning after breakfast the colors for this spring are too much for me i found a couple of items and then left announced my fb page to a couple of friend groups and they seem pretty cool about that anxiety hit again so i stayed in bed for an 1 hours took a shower and will make dinner soon i am really depressed and anxious right

yesterday i dont know quite how i feela lot of emotions going on i need a small break to process this but need to do it without them feeling unloved ive had some low level anxiety since my therapy appointment yesterday afternoon finally hit my breaking point earlier today and had a full blown panic attack took forever to calm down if ive even really calmed down at all my husband was able to help me deescalate a little bit but im frustrated that i couldnt do it myself ive been using the calm app and meditating to the daily calm to help me im experiencing some anxiety or nervous energy today and its really bothering me ive had it under control for a few days ive canceled my 3 appointments for today but i refuse to sit here and accomplish nothing im getting so anxious about my vacation this weekend i dont know what is so anxietyproducing but its really starting to get to me maybe it has to do with bfs friends getting pushy about the trip i always hate that had my hair done today it looks really good wrote a poem and made dinner had anxiety hit again so laid down and tried to nap other than that not much else is happening my guts have been in an uproar since last night so im taking it easy feeling better today going to my brothers birthday lunch pleasant and will force me to get out of the house however my sister who i only see on birthdays and holidays because she is toxic and angry will be there and i have a lot of anxiety about that for the last 710 days i have been experiencing a great deal of anxiety but it is like none i have gone through before until now my anxiety seems to be in response to some impending situation or event usually it is either catastrophic in nature or pertaining to my self worth but this last week or so i am just generally plain anxious all the time i wake up anxious  about what i do not know i am frazzled throughout the day the anxiety makes it difficult to concentrate i cant even sit still i pace about my home and go from one activity to another with no reason the feeling is so unpleasant i have been crawling into bed early just so i dont have to experience the discomfort of it what the heck is this went out to lunch with part of my family for my brothers birthday was really anxious going into it but had a really good time was it because everyone was on their best behavior or because i had a huge pina colada with a side shot of rum rarely drink we may never know quiet day today did two loads of laundry and the kids took a bag of my old stuff to goodwill i wrote a poem and marinated the chicken for dinner tonight i finally remembered will be cooking that soon most of the day though was spent shopping online i hate it when i buy clothes because i usually dont stop until i run out of money its like a habit my husband now has to have two molars pulled because theyre growing crooked going to be a fun time driving because the dentists office is in a busy part of town had some anxiety this afternoon

haunts a nearby park lots of frogs and turtles out so that was cool my remaining batch of clothes came in today so theyre now in the dryer still couldnt get into my online orientation course for school looks like that wont happen until monday been a pretty good day overall will be a little busy tomorrow anxiety was up for a bit but it went away after i took more vistaril my pdoc also messed up one of my prescriptions but im just going to deal with since its even harder to get that fixed than the metformin hello all saturday had several anxiety attacksim trying to handle these attacks on my own but sometimes it becomes really difficult sunday i tried to stay busy but some of the anxiety snuck in i use exercise to reduce anxiety but i am realizing i need medication as well how do you handle your anxiety do you use medications to help reduce the anxiety attacks thank you pinkrose some moderate anxiety i think because i have a lot to do today outside the house nothing i cant handle the daily calm meditation helped a lot this morning went to t this morning kept it short since i was nervous and tired at the same time and couldnt focus took a short nap and felt better did some housework and it kept my mind of things there is still stuff that is not fixed but im waiting on other people to do their thing and im helpless on that whenever i get anxious like now i just cant reach for a klonopin because nobody will prescribe it for me except maybe ip i took a benedryl and that helped some to calm me down unorthodox but hey you do what you gotta do tomorrow morning i go to the gym so that aughtta do some good for the endorphins and im going out to bday lunch with my mom both of ours and i got her a really neat book so that will be fun but i found that laying down with just your brain to entertain you is not what you need when anxious very irritable right now and snapping at my family i dont know what the problem is but i am soooo angry right now this is rare for me took a cold shower that helped a little bit got the med issue fixed but school is throwing more crap at me makes me wonder if i should even go back kind of wound up now but hoping to chill out have bad anxiety over the messiness of my house today feel like im suffocating trying to tackle my sons room today because if i cant get in there to put things away his stuff piles up in all the other rooms getting very overwhelmed and on the verge of tears my school online account is fixed and i took the online orientation course waiting to see when theyll score it so i can apply for my class went out to two parks this morning and afternoon beautiful day and lots of flowers birds and animals out and people well people are animals too now waiting for my husband to finish taking a nap so we can make dinner anxiety was curbed by being outside i think i need to get out of the house more but well see i have so much to do today but cannot concentrate my private student loan company wont stop calling me or my work i have been doing really good for four months but i feel like my anxiety and depression are coming back because of these loans and phone calls i am working with someone to fix this but the phone calls wont stop i feel like they may never stop i feel like i may never be able to fully live i feel like i need to talk to someone but dont know where to go im really scared a few days ago i try and went to the store after a while and that was good im feeling a bit anxious my pharmacy called and my meds are ready but i need to call back because i need to change the quantity

prepare for my family coming over for easter i am anxious about my ability to get everything done ill take it one small step at a time hello all thought i would post on this forum i have an anxiety disorder as well sometimes the anxiety comes out of nowhere im relaxing watching tv and all of a sudden it rears its ugly head i get extremely edgy at times i think i have a bit of ocd i do exercise quite a bit which helps my anxiety i get obsessive about exercising though work causes me a good amount of stress which leads to anxiety i deal with this the best i can without medication currently i have a bipolar employee i work with honestly i dont think her meds are working shes all over the place verbally attacking everyone makes for a difficult environment im trying to get a different medication for anxietyright now i take lorazepam which works well during the day i cannot use this medication due to the sleepiness it causes if i may ask what medications work well for anxiety other than a benzo everybodys experience is different but i take neurontin and vistaril to cope with my anxiety it seems to help my pdocs office doesnt give out benzos because a lot of substance abusers go through them spend a large chunk of today with a headache i stayed in bed for quite a bit but couldnt sleep i did get one batch of photos done and uploaded to flickr though need to take a shower make dinner and go to church anxiety is up a little but its manageable fharriage thank you for your response i will look into the neurontin and vistaril hope your day gets better as it progresses pinkrose

went well thought and i am in a flood of relief it all has left me quite exhausted i worked through my anxiety today i added keywords for all my posts on my web site i also rehearsed for tomorrow when ill be reading in church so far so good i work extremely hard to stay positive and happy but i get sad and anxious too just like everyone  rachel platten just a little anxious about going to my acupuncturist sometimes i do better then others anxious about getting my chores and errands done overwhelmed good morning all during an anxiety attack has anyone ever experienced a fear of losing your mind i get edgy hyperactive and feel the need to escape somewhere maybe i am losing my mind hmmm pinkrose got through church okay had some anxiety afterwards but its more of a rebound anxiety than anything took my meds and chilled out for a while pinkrose1958 ive had that feeling it was that or i was going to have a heart attack chest pain is one of my first symptoms daughter got home from her senior prom at 430 am and just woke up has an attitude and just being plain nasty because i dont want to go out with her to ihop for pancakes feel anxious right now really dont feel like dealing with her moodiness right now slightly anxious have to get something done today that seems utterly overwhelming to me i will just take it in small steps i recently had a very anxious situation in which i was with a group of people when one started saying and acting upon sexual harassment she went on to sexually assault our restaurant server he was humiliated by her actions so was i i pleaded silently for someone to say something this was the bosss wife which is why i am sure nothing was done i was so incredibly anxious she then went on to include in her offensive behaviour a disgusting racist and islamaphobic rant about new canadians i somehow found the strength to finally speak up the best i could do was crack a joke about she herself being an immigrant she wasnt pleased gosh what a difficult dinner this was but the anxiety hasnt stopped there i spent the rest of the weekend worrying about what might happen to my boyfriend as a result of my making a nervous joke it was the bosss wife after all no anxiety this morning even though i have a full day i feel optimistic about today ok thanks jennifer i definitely will do that i had this too when i came off medication it doesnt last forever i take geodon it works pretty good im expecting a phone call which has my anxiety turned up to 100 we went on vacation with some friends a couple of weeks ago which completely exhausted me way too much social interactions so lately ive been wanting to sit at home and be left alone no visitors no phone calls no texts but i have no reason to go to the office today so im working from home and have to make phone calls its too easy to want to not be working when im home but since im not making money right now theres no reason to waste the money to drive to work ill just sit around there anyway went to t and the dentist today t was good the dentist not so much if i could have chocolate i would but i cant so i wont obviously i had some anxiety but i missed my afternoon meds and its too late to take them now just trying to keep calm so i can make dinner and be okay ive felt anxious all day today ive hardly been able to do anything other than lay on my couch and worry about every problem my brain could make up i hate days like this i dont see my t for a few weeks so i think that is making things worse my daughter is at her dads house and i talked to her via phone she said she had some things happening in her life and sounded so sad it broke my heart and made me experience anxiety many times my moods are impacted by hers does this make me a caring mom or codependent i just try to solve all her problems im anxious and sad so i spoke to my friend yesterday the 1 whos going to have the surgery friday she seemed okay about it yesterday and when i asked why she thought that is she just said  today is a good day im glad she was okay no anxiety right now but im sure it will come as i tackle my overwhelming chore constantly anxious and depressed but still using cbt and dbt to challenge a lot of my anxious thoughts the depression is more a feeling state that i think comes from being too stressed all the time im not on medication so tackling anxiety from a cognitive and behavioral stance is imperative i have to forge on with the cbt work dbt offers many coping techniques for anxiety but one has to diligently apply them for them to be effective anxious this morning i need to contact my caretaker to rat out my neighbour it needs to be done i dont like to rock the boat see above been a quiet day today took a shower did two loads of laundry reading my poetry textbook for class in a couple of weeks pretty good book but expensive anxiety returned at around 1 pm ate too much food i see the diabetes nurse tomorrow so i hope i can get my med increased the increase will also take care of some of the craving anxiety will always be a part of my existence i will go on with hope although often i do not know why still feeling pretty anxious after the loss of my dad but ive managed it better today than i have in almost a week finishing masters degree court battles for hubby to get contact with his daughter my stepdaughter money worries and im pregnant to say im overwhelmed is an understatement went to hospital for followup with doctor she didnt like that my blood sugar was dropping so she lowered my metformin waited for an hour at the base pharmacy for that also got a referral to the neurosurgeon for the bulging discs in my back im tired of having pain when i bend over but surgery might make it worse had some anxiety but took my meds and felt better my anxiety seems out of control this morning i cant focus at work and i have a deadline next week i also feel pressure from all directions work home myselfi hope it is just an overreaction and that i can handle this picked up refills and made an appointment for the neurosurgeon other than that its been a quiet day anxiety at midday im looking through med side effects to see if there is a med im taking that is causing the drop in blood sugar i havent found it yet and i may call my pdoc next week i know lautda is causing the restlessness but i need a new script for more artane to all who want happy to hear that jennifer im having moderate anxiety today had some anxiety this afternoon tried to lie down but no go for that i did two loads of laundry and will be making soup for dinner here soon not much else happened mood is kind of down maybe a letdown from yesterday having some anxiety today nobody slept well because of the thunderstorms so i actually slept during the time im normally restless my blood sugar was good as well still need to figure out whats causing it to drop read some of my college textbooks to prepare for next term now chilling out before i feed the cats and start dinner if my husband remembers to get broccoli very anxious i have a total lack of motivation right now and so very much to do its just putting me into a panic i really have to get this done thanks folks my blood sugar is doing better and i did a lot of housework today plus went to church made dinner early and now kicking back husband is having two teeth at least being pulled tomorrow ill have to drive him home through a busy part of town going to be interesting anxiety was there but i was busy and didnt notice it much feeling anxiety today  daughter is practicing for graduation this morning  not

havent posted but i am feeling anxious  constant butterflies  for over 2 weeks i dont really know why or maybe i do its all kinda muddled i emailed my t to say im feeling anxious she suggested to make a list of things causing it a good idea and now all my reasons seem stupid the anxiety is distracting me from getting my work done husbands dental appointment went well he was under local anesthesia so he wanted to drive home hes now in some pain but it will be at least a day or two before the swelling goes down i just hope its done by wednesday afternoon since we have our spa day otherwise its been pretty quiet had plenty of anxiety but got through it my anxiety and panic has been through the roof again today i did pretty well yesterday though i just feel as if ive let myself down my anxiety is tempered with benzos again in my horrible life i really want to go home having a panic attack this morning anxiety level really high i feel unable to handle anything and like im falling into a pit with no way out cant seem to help myself up i also feel really bad that this keeps happeninglike im letting people down anxiety level has tapered off big weekend full of triggers but i

brought my meds and took them oh wow i started an anxiety attack for the first time in a long time im starting to relax but i dont want to jinx anything ive been doing so well nobody is answering me on the hotline dont know what to do anxious today had plans and appointments but cancelled them trying not to go into full on panic mode i have some transitions occurring in my life that are unnerving me after weeks of anxiety that was no more than a small blip on the radar i find myself today with it quite elevated i am concerned about a woman who keeps hitting cars during her attempts to park i feel the need to be vigilantly watching out the window so as to run down with a note to leave on the other cars should she do so yet again three times in a day and a half i also need to call my optometrists office to obtain my information so as i can order my eyeglasses elsewhere i am afraid of a confrontation for some reason my anxiety is incredibly high this morning i know ive been stressed for a while but there really isnt anything going on right now that would be causing more anxiety than usual but i keep feeling like a panic attack is on its way someone keeps knocking on the door everytime i go to the bathroom i dont know whos doing it i need to know details of things always do you think this is an anxiety thing or a personality traitinterest have always been like this needing to know what do you think been up and down today some of it is circumstantial went to t this morning and that was alright mostly talked about school and our anniversary yesterday the owner of the roofing company came and said our roof was installed wrong by the builder somehow im not surprised but it means we cant use insurance to pay for the roof good thing we got that loan just trying to chill out now while waiting to make dinner in a few hours husband has a dry socket again and an infection so will have to watch what i cook for the next few days my anxiety has continued to rise i just had to make a choice and it puts my boyfriend in a difficult spot frankly i cannot associate myself with his friends any more i have never met a bunch of such religiously intolerant racist bigots and aholes in my life i saw something on my facebook feed that caused me to cry this morning it was so vile ive had enough of keeping my mouth shut and not stirring the pot my anxiety it is over the flack this will cause and the difficult position i am placing my boyfriend in hope everyone feels better i know i could use some prayers listening to daniel johnstons discography was a mistake i kept bursting into tears througout the day and had to find somewhere to relax last night it triggered a panic attack omg but i love him did okay today went out for some shopping so i was doing something for a while tomorrow ill be waiting while my husband has an mri done will need enough to keep me occupied for about two hours im a bit anxious for my exam tomorrow but i guess thats normal kept busy today with church and some shopping anxiety tried to sneak in but i was distracted with clothes finding a swimsuit that fits is a bear still keeping up with everything i woke up in physical pain and very anxious around 330 i had a nightmare so maybe its that plus the pain that is causing it havent felt this anxious in awhile and i really dont like the feeling as it unsettles me happy birthday sitting in the waiting room waiting for my husband to finish his mri he gets two a year to check the progression of his ms i took my afternoon meds so i can remain calm i dont know if i will have to drive him home or not other than that a typical day i am doing rather well today it really makes me feel crappy when my phone anxiety is so bad it takes me all day to get up the courage to call someone then i get vmail and they never call me back i dont understand why im so sensitive listening to one daniel johnston album put me out of it for like 3 days anyways im doing pretty well today got nothing done but oh well i started to feel anxious and queasy but i just used this oil rub my mom taught me to make and felt better immediately i think im also really vulnerable to the placebo effect but im not complaining i was checking fb for some info about a class im attending and after two minutes of fb ive already felt nauseous had palpitations just saw events and people posting and life happening and i just felt overwhelmed and afraid now im in bed and still extremely afraid why is this happening to me quotesubtle lights5641294i was checking fb for some info about a class im

was out today between prom premothers day and just being a nice day it was a zoo plus our power was out for an hour while emergency maintenance was done it dropped for 30 seconds at midnight last night i just finished making dinner which was a comedy of errors from dropping the melted butter and it overflowing in the microwave to putting a sticking batter on top to it overflowing in the ovenim not that hungry anymore tomorrow im going to church then im going back to bed im not getting mothers day brunch until thursday anyway because the kids have to work now the project is over my freelance employer said that theres no other project at the moment i am jobless now doing nothing but stuck my  in front of my laptop waiting for some kind of miracle happen and somehow got a job went to church made dinner did a load of laundry updated some software made the bed worked on photos the kids have to work and start school again so mothers day dinner is postponed until thursday i feel like stiff and sore and like a pile of slimy goo i attended my familys mothers daybirthday celebration with no xanax or klonopin other then what i normally take at thanksgiving christmas and for easter ive had panic attacks but this time i was calm i hope this progress remains between my daughter working and our familys celebration i only got to spend about 15 minutes of quality time with my daughter and i missed her i spent quality time with her for my birthday last week so im grateful for that first day of school online i introduced myself completed the first assignment and now trying to write a poem its hard since i took a break so i wouldnt be burned out also trying not to overthink it made a batch of double chocolate cookies i made them small so one wouldnt be a sugar bomb had some anxiety around 1 pm laid down for a little bit but my feet were twitching i just want to get to wednesday when i get my hair done and thursday for our belated mothers day dinner i went out with my mom and grandma again today that always makes me feel better today has been pretty good thankfully i have social anxiety so im not really bonding with the smokers here im the only one who uses an ecig and they are full of curiosity my rls is driving me insane i dont know what to do for it klonopin always used to relieve it my roommate is a smoker we still have not talked at all maybe were clones shes a lot like me i think i actually just wish i could use my vape in my room they would never know but my things are on the cart at the nurses station and i can only use them in the very controlling system here ive been feeling very little anxiety for the past several days my daughter even shared something pretty heavy with me last night and i took it in stride slowly making progress turned in my work for class started some small chat with the other students its easier from home because i can think things out a little bit my teacher is probably going to have a field day with my homework but oh well still having a hard time calming down mowers are out today so kind of antsy making dinner in about an hour or so feel some anxiety because of my daughters graduation friday i feel like i have a lot to do in very little time and there is the emotional factor im irritated and snapping at everyone i have had overall less anxiety the days when my tank is working when its not i get really agitated but for the most part im getting through it and maybe theyll let me leave after a month one of my former colleagues died sunday of a heart attack my husband and i talked quite a bit about this and took in some comfort food for breakfast i also got my hair done this afternoon i feel better anxiety hit around 1130 am i laid down until i had to get ready for the hairdresser making dinner now nerves are up a bit i am having a good day put photos up online forgot to start the laundry and my husband is taking a nap before we go out for dinner so itll have to wait until tomorrow didnt do much else daughter brought me a bunch of tulips for mothers day were going out at 5 pm will have to wake up husband at 4 im still restless it started at 1130 am and while it has gone down with meds im still antsy i didnt sleep well so i woke up late had just enough time for breakfast before my husband left for class im starting to have a headache i dont really want to feel this way ive had a few anxiety attacks today one that was real pronounced was when i was about to go to a pizza hut to pick up an order i had placed as soon as i got outside and started my car and got in i started feeling the hyperventilation isssues my diaphragm was getting tense but i surely wasnt breathing too fast i know for sure it got worse as i arrived and was waiting for my order to get done when i got home and inside my hyperventilation feeling slowly dissipated another real pronounced but more like it was a full blown panicanxiety attack was when i got a phone call from the receptionist from my counselor saying my appointment was cancelled because my insurance wont cover more than 2 visits per week im still in panic over that im still having the pins n needles feeling in my arms you wont be judged i havent found that to be my experience at all the people have been kind understanding and supportive if someone is on the off chance being negative you can ignore them and you wont see their post anymore sending big hugs i havent checked in for a while ive been keeping things somewhat manageable except today and it is really quite silly i was seated in my coffee shop next to a fellow eating his noodle bowl why in the cafe i couldnt figure out slurping sucking inhaling for some reason this caused me a great deal of anxiety i havent figured it out the trigger but no sooner did i get up and walk out than the emotion subsided here it is 537 in the morning and ive been up since 3 i feel anxious about madisons graduation anxiety about all i have to do today anxiety at this transition and anxiety at seeing my exhusband for the first time in 8 years ive forgiven him the abuse while i was ill and i wish him well but i dont want or need to see him wish me luck i will do this for my daughter i have a little more anxiety today i hope it dissolves soon i wasnt fast enough to make it to the morning smoking break but a young nurse rebraided my hair which was so sweet of her my hair was getting shaggy again still i want my vape darn it yay i made it to and through my daughters graduation with only a few tears i ruined my vape after filling the tank because i flooded the coil and the tank started leaking because i was afraid to turn it too tight so it was very aggravating and every puff was hot juice it is stressing me out if my vape has problems i get panicky especially here where im not at liberty to work much with it i filled it and after all the leaking it needed to be filled again but i didnt tell them my other batteries need to be charged im very on edge been a slow day woke up late because i didnt sleep well wrote a poem outside of class and ruminating on a prompt for my churchs magazine next month reading and thinking listening to podcasts missed my morning meds and not as anxious but still anxious had anxiety again this afternoon made it hard to go through the supermarket had my husband find stuff and trying not to cruise into other carts lots of people doing my studying for next week found the link the instructor gave out didnt work so i emailed him and he gave out another link so far so good will be making dinner soon couldnt have perch so will be making a casserole instead and my itunes just rick rolled me fun stuff feeling very little anxiety this weekend just have a lot to do but im not too upset about that my therapist said she may have to close her practice in september that does make me anxious this therapist is worth her weight in gold as a member of my support team she is trying to work some things out like therapy by phone or computer fine by mehope it works out not much happening today the roof leaked again and there was water coming into my home office this morning so sick of this but have to wait until the roofers have time to repair it and have good weather it may be the end of this month didnt feel well still have poor sleep didnt go to church and couldnt take a nap restless and hungry even though ive been eating decent meals anxiety is up as is depression just trying to ride this out until tuesday when i see my pdoc for the last time i hope i get a good pdoc next time went to therapy cut it short because the anxiety kicked in again finished two critiques of my classmates poems i hope i did okay i dont like critiquing that much but its part of the course hope i get a good nights sleep before seeing the pdoc tomorrow having just a little bit of anxiety today the bombing has unnerved me as im sure it has other people i have a huge to do list but it hasnt impacted my anxietyyet it seems to be a constant battle hope everyone else is doing well i am afraid and dont know why just feel this huge fear i dont want to get out of the bed and i shouldnt be here at this hour just want to stay safe did some breathing excercises will do maybe more very good lately i recently went through a bit of an ordeal but at no time did i have a melt down or lose my cool i was ready to accept whatever would happen it turned out for the good in the end i was awfully proud of myself for staying in control knowing the details of things is something i need to know in my case it makes me feel like i have more control over the situation and feel theres less chance of anything getting out of control or of hurting me best wishes my daughter is home today and were going to work on a big todo list all day it will be nice to get that done and move on i dont think or at least hope i dont get anxious i was having a relationship problem that was causing me anxietydepression and pain one of the posters mentioned the word jekyl and i had an immediate paradigm shift as i thought about that episode of scooby doo that had jekylhyde in it the next time that anger is turned towards me im going to picture jekyl ill be ok now hope everyone is doing ok woke up late because i didnt sleep well went to pick up meds after breakfast so i missed all my morning meds still had anxiety and had to lie down for a couple of hours cleaned up the dishes and fed the cats too tired to cook still having lots of anxiety with class trying to work through it so i had to put someone on my users ignore list today you guys know i really try hard to encourage and support you and i care about the people on these boards ive never got negative rude and creepy vibes from anybody else but this guy he was looking for people to support his rationalization for treating his wife badly i very politely disagreed he was abrasive and arrogant thats not what im about did i do the right thing got another piece of homework done waiting on other students who probably wont show up until the weekend for the last bit i keep slogging through this even though there is a lot of me that wants to quit still need to use the artane it hit about 930 and is still roaring husband went to the supermarket after his class and picked up a bunch of stuff i dont know if im using it or not i wish he would have just stuck to the list or took me with him kids are doing other stuff tonight afaik making a ham and noodle casserole sounds like thunder outside we had a tornado touch down on a nearby town last night no anxiety today knock on wood and im going to work on my to do list and my daughter will be gone for the next 3 days hopefully things will go well hope everyone is doing ok i guess this is baseline anxiety that im having here my social anxiety has me almost mute here too like my roommate its like being a nun in a convent except they dont have 24 hours days of being around people and there are more men here i think than women update i got my prn refilled and took a couple ive slept all day since im so worn out by this morning finished homework for this week and two out of three loads of laundry are done went to one of the local parks this morning and saw a chipmunk and hummingbird im glad to see the hummingbird since we set out our feeder and havent seen any yet anxiety came around noon so laid down until 3 pm i missed my afternoon meds im not feeling that great and i still have to make dinner i just wish i could crawl back into bed i had absolute hell getting off kpin ive mentioned that before but since maybe november or december the pdoc at the clinic prescribed me ativan it doesnt feel the same as the kpin not really much relief but then as circumstances would have it ive been given i think 5 kpin per day since the hospital and here at the rehab nursing home too i could ask for them to not give me it but then id feel even worse so ill just take it and if i ever get back home i can taper myself off at my own pace with the ativan if its helping you i agree with the others take it tell your pdoc that you need a very long taper and direct them to the ashton manual good luck raspberry went to my nieces graduation today and a big celebration party no anxiety or panic thats a big step for me did have waterworks yesterday wondering if i would be able to do it yay i succeeded hope everyone is doing ok a tad bit anxious today i have other things going on maybe my anxiety would be a whole lot worse i agreed to be a patient for a medical student on his psychiatric round so of course the performance anxiety is beginning to rear its head i really need the cash stipend though get checked out asap i had nonpainful spasms in my chest and put up with it for 3 weeks then my jaw and left arm started aching with them so got to hospital it was a heart attack got one stent put in my days are getting messed up i keep seeing images of what ive been doing but i dont remember if it was yesterday or today we went to an ice cream place and had hot dogs with hot fudge sundaes i worked on some security stuff for the computers i read my weekly homework assignment thats about it anxiety came up at 1230pm extra artane isnt helping because i take doses outside of the window of when it happens i feel good today actually looking forward to going to florida for 2 weeks thats not usually the case slept for 3 hours last night might be going too high hope everyone has a good day feeling anxious and restless have a lot to do to get ready for florida im all over the place today hope everyone is doing ok turned my second poem in for my class did a load of laundry im feeling calmer but im still having anxiety issues laid down for a while as my husband was taking a nap were grilling burgers tonight i think we have everything so that should be good i stopped drinking coffee a year ago now ive started again yesterday i drank a cup an hour ago or so and since then im so excited having all these amazing plans like i could do anything but then the anxiety kicks in that i cantand then i jump back again and jumping from thought to thought i cant stick with anything to do because im in my next plan already and its like a crazy train non stopim alone in my flat and taking to myself out loud and im exhausted but its fun in the same time uhmm i hate it i get so anxious at the weirdest times and about the weirdest things like signing my name and filling out forms in front of people carrying a full cup of hot coffee they all make me jittery or even shakey its annoying getting anxious at all i have to do to get ready for florida it doesnt help that im only sleeping 3 hours a night having issues pertaining to family members really making me anxious and sad guess ill have a good cry and start getting ready for florida hope everyone is having an ok day i should go somewhere but cant because of this huge fear i feel is coffee that bad for me finished my other class assignment took a shower and picked up a few things from the supermarket they moved all the stuff around so its more nervewracking to find things still had anxiety but kept it down by doing stuff now sitting down again and waiting to feed the cats and make dinner i think the kids will be home so itll be family night im not doing well today ive already texted the crisis line and made a safety plan seeing pdoc tomorrow just feeling really low and hopeless i was on edge yesterday on account of the very poor behaviour of others my anxiety was quite heightened as i was in constant worry about what these people might do next it was all very mortifying and i was so very grateful when the event came to an end oh god my anxiety is spiking and i dont know whats going on i feel horrible and i have no prns right now im so afraid that it was obvious at work that i was almost having a panic attack but i just didnt have any way to deal with it im still feeling so on edge i need to get going home so i can stop at the pharmacy and refill my prns im still shaky after my crisis of yesterdayi have so much to do to get ready for florida i have to get on my feet quickly usually my daughter grounds me but shes at her dads not sure how to move forward quickly anxious because i need to be cleaning and packing instead of watching politics a punishment of my own making i hope everyone is having a good day i had some of those there was one where i even convinced the er doc that i was indeed having one but id rather go and be wrong than stay home and be right i can relate to this i get bad chest pain with anxiety ive never gone in though but my doc did 2 ekgs to make sure things were good i got the horrible news that im supposed to be here the rest of my life i guess my anxiety is way up but i feel very numb ok now that ive totally wasted the weeki have about 5 days of activities to cram into one and still hope to leave at 300 am saturday morning at least im moving in the right direction my anxiety is increasing as time passes wth the world is not ending i need to go down to the pool my sanctuary and float for awhile i hope everyone is doing well did two loads of laundry and planned meals for the week otherwise just reading and posting making dinner tonight anxiety rolled around 1030 am laid down for a while but couldnt sleep i may have to take some more artane in the morning will discuss with new pdoc i am doing well nobody in my family other than my grandma got me so much as a card for my birthday not that i need presents but some kind of acknowledgement or something would be nice especially when my sisters get so much i feel like im being a brat but it really hurt my feelings i keep fighting off tears oki really dread my anxiety disorder nobody needs to feel sorry for meit just helps me to get it off my chest i get this paralyzing anxiety before every vacation and every holidayreally before any big change i hate this with a passion i work on it in therapy i use my coping techniques and yet it remains i am so paralyzed i cant get off the recliner and im leaving tomorrow and i have to get my drivers license renewed it might as well be traveling to the moon for as capable as i feel anyway thanks for letting me get some of it out its an added pressure on my daughter and thats not fair to her i wish i felt nothing sometimes being too sensitive and emotional is the pits i need to calm down take a deep breath do my daily calm meditation make a reasonable plan and be gentle and compassionate with myself beating myself up for this wont help anything just remain calmtake deep breaths did three loads of laundry and vacuumed the living room had to stop because my sides hurt i dont know what the deal is worked on my poem for the church magazine will probably send it in tomorrow still having anxiety even with the lower dose of latuda ugh im struggling to fall back asleep because im so anxious already took a prn hopefully it helps soon things have been going ok but its just such a slow process im so scared it wont be fast enough for us to make it through everything i need help but i dont know what will help or what i need right now im just afraid i am on a roll a good roll but inside my head it is saying you are a failure you will mess up you will fail i know this is not true but i know everyone here shares the same struggles so i am distracting myself here at the coffee shop and talking to anyone here who will listen i been doing fairly good being calmer with anxiety since therapy but i had a slip up yesterday and i even told my therapist via email while he was nice and encouraging about it i still feel like i probably annoyed him just so frustrated with my setback same experience it happened more than a year ago i swore theres a brown spot at my chest where my heart is suppose to be after my panic attack maybe its there before and didnt notice hope all of you who are hurting start feeling better soon take gentle care of yourselves woke up late again neither my husband or i slept well sent in my poem to the person in charge of the church magazine hope it flies been a quiet day anxiety came up around 1pm so i laid down for a while husband came in around 2 pm and is still asleep i need to get up and make dinner soon another early morning went to church then picked up groceries for the week for some reason we picked up a bunch of chocolate i didnt have lunch or my afternoon meds so that may be it starting dinner soon anxiety hit around noon but was busy so it didnt bother me as much im not really nervous today the people in my head are talking to me and keeping me upbeat t says i shouldnt focus on the people but since they are helping my anxiety i think i will i lost my anniversary ring sometime this morning it was loose already and it fell off husband decided to buy a new band it was some serious bucks and i dont know if we have enough to last the month im frustrated sad and anxious i couldve waited until next month to get a new one but he was persistent im not as upset as i could be though so the meds must be doing something went to t and cut it short because it was there when i noticed my ring was missing spent most of the day backtracking to places and asking people i think someone took off with it after it fell making dinner now its going to be a tight month slightly anxious about my therapy appointment tomorrow my t is great and i love going but a little part of me gets a little anxious before each one doing so well with my anxiety that im not taking xanax klonopin or something otc i take for anxiety so far  no withdrawals before the trip quite a few panic attacks and severe anxiety and now nothing reading a good but simple book 15 things you should give up to be happy helpful to me hope everyone is ok and has a good day at least i got two homework assignments done the third is rather long so ill work on it tomorrow anxiety hit around 11 am so laid down and didnt get up until 230 pm i missed prepping the chicken for dinner will have to think of something else to eat since all four of us are home husband is taking a nap now so it may be a while i had other stuff to do today but i slept through it hopefully ill feel better tomorrow my therapy session this afternoon was great however my dog broke his hind leg so i am really anxious and stressed i did tell my therapist via email and he never replies unless its during office hours but he did at 830pm telling me he was so sorry and we are in this thoughts and i can come in on friday what a night gad bipolar borderline personality disorder my best trait is reasonable much understanding has come with age and experience however tonight i can barely control my unreasonable panic today i safely and carefully posted items for sale on an internet site in my area if anyone wanted to buy either item they would have to contact me privately to gain correct name or location so that isnt a factor in my severe anxiety what i am feeling is exposed i could almost vomit the terror is so palpable i have no respect for myself because this is unreasonable faces and thoughts of strangers pass through my head so strongly i can almost see them the psychic feeling of others is pushing me over and trampling me with the quantity i tell myself it isnt reasonable and it isnt real but there seems severe danger i know from being taught that it isnt real but logic and frightflight of the terrorized animal is at war within me i am cold and sweating i am sick from tension it will go away im sorry youre having a tough time are you feeling any better this morning im having a hard time watching my little birds 18 year old daughter and niece fly feeling tremendous pain and pride right now hope everyone is ok and having a good day finished last homework assignment did a load of laundry picked up test strips and lipitor made the brine for the roasted chicken while my husband was napping took a shower at least i did some things today cookies will have to wait until tomorrow i had some anxiety around noon i was out so i had to hide it a bit hello leod i hope you are feeling better today breathing and meditation helps me i found a dr caroline leaf you can find her on youtube she has helped me tons my dr says that they come from fear when i dont run away and look the panic attack in the eye it really helps hello welcome to pc i think one of two things will happen it will wear off with time or you will see a doctor who will assuage your fears i hope you feel better soon sending big hugs i had a bit of an attack on the bus last night it was most unpleasant the tight chest the difficulty breathing the shaking beyond control and the panic all was going to be a disaster add to that the humiliation that this was all quite public also public was the aftermath for it was a good hour of coming down before i returned back to normal for an hour i continued to shake breathe with difficulty and experience a racing heart i was supposed to fill out and sign myself in to a meeting and couldnt even hold the pen it was embarrassing asking someone else to do so for me during the meeting support group i was sick with worry about getting home and thus walked for 45min instead of taking the bus one tiny bit of my anxiety is gone today i got an email this morning that my deferment on my student loan was approved that saves me almost 150 a month i am already anxious about the day though my boyfriend just left for the day so ill be home alone for most of it plus the job recruiter ive been working with is going to call the ceo of a company i want to work for about me i keep telling myself that if he feels comfortable enough calling the company about me i must have a shot at the job im just so worried about it and on top of all that i have an interview elsewhere this afternoon that i dont feel prepared for so much to do and so little time to do it my anxiety has been extremely high lately ive been searching for a full time job for months and have posted extensively on that in other areas so ill skip the details for now last friday i was contacted about a job that i had figured i was passed over for and they let me know that theres another opening and they are seriously considering me i feel like i practically have the job they wanted to start a background check and contact my references nothing there that will change their minds so now im just waiting for an offer and its killing me its now wednesday so the background check should be done i assume theyve made contact with most if not all of my references and still i havent heard anything im not overly excited about the job itself but i really need something full time and its so exciting to possibly finally get a break i just wish they would call or email me and let me know whats going on the other part thats making my anxiety so bad is trying to figure out the timing of everything my current job has no delay in payment so once i quit i wont have a last paycheck a few weeks later to rely on for bills i could potentially go a full month with no income before i get paid at the new job and thats tearing me apart i really cant figure out any way to time it so that i wont have so much time without income and i dont know what i can do to make it through that time im hoping that worst case i can borrow money from my parents theyve been helping me pay my rent for the past few months so maybe this could be a last time rent payment that i can use for other bills since the next month they wont be giving me money for rent i dont know yet im not getting any information and its driving me crazy i hope you get a call soon my anxiety right now has risen sky high after a confrontation for some reason i am feeling at fault as though i erred or was inhospitable  this despite saying and addressing what needed to be done so i worry about repercussions even though i know i was absolutely right my anxiety is fairly low today and i am thankful for that i am concerned it will be soaring next week it will be busy at worktraveling and working late a few nights i had an anxiety attack yesturday one in over 30 years i hope they dont come back i thought i was rid o them could have been because i missed a med im on 10 of them a day the amount of anxiety i have about washing my hair and going to the dentist is insane how did i get like this i wish i could go home to my favorite place and time im wondering how i managed to sleep for 12 hours ive had two cups of coffee with freeze dried coffee mixed into it for strength but i still feel spaced out and incapable of anything i wish i were at home with no dentist appointment to get ready for and just be able to sleep 24 hours a day if i want anxiety is getting to me emotionally i am struggling this morning due to a family crisis i also have a deadline at work i am worried about my ability to handle this week i have learned to handle the routine but crisis is still a huge challenge for me to handle maybe i can respond better than in the past struggling todaythoughts are swirling in my head i dont knowwish i could press the pause button sorry i checkedin twice i have to manage to appear like i have it altogether for the next 3 days at work we have a deadline and are working into the evening hours but i am strugglinganxiety headaches tired worried sad what a mess my stomach and nerves tell me im anxious about something wish it would be more specific im not equipped for this cold weather i may just stay in at 7 i really wish i had ice and some rum and a little striped straw and coke of course and if i did id go hang out in the solarium and watch tv ive been craving a rum and coke lately i guess something is reminding me of when i was 20 or so i think i found a big source of my anxiety theres a new guy in my department 3 people total at work and im still training him currently work is really really slow i want to send him to a different department so we can all have something to do and not just stand around twiddling our thumbs but theres not a lot of work in the other departments either for some reason this gives me anxiety like i want the guy to like me or not see me as a jerk or something but i dont really care if he likes me the last couple of days hes been in the other department  theyve been good days for me but hes not the smartest cookie  keeps coming back to our department when i told him multiple times that i would call him back when we need his help i just want him to go away having anxiety and panic attacks today out of nowhere i wish i could get better control of these things i always wonder what im doing wrong when they hit i hope everyone has a nice weekend and am sending hugs to those that are struggling have to read for church on sunday im not doing well physically so i hope i still can do it anxiety is building up i started wellbutrin on wednesday and was not prepared for the ramp up of anxiety had a hellish day yesterday today i have cut out all caffeine even decaf coffees i seem better today i have heard that the initial anxious phase is tough then there is the honeymoon phase i hope i get there im struggling with anxiety and i have a newborn to look after the birth was traumatic and he ended up in hospital for jaundice for 3 days im coping with infected stiches and taken tons of antibiotics i just want to keep my head above water so i can look after my son im sending best wishes and positive vibes to everyone that experiences panic and anxiety during the holidays you dont have to read this im just posting this so i can process it and hopefully keep moving i get anxiety on the holidays that usually progresses to panic attacks pretty rapidly right now my heart is pounding and i have a big ball of dread in my stomach theres a lot i need to be doing right now but im paralyzed im using my anxiety coping techniques i dont understand why it happens i wish i did i love my familythere is no serial killer to fear im sure there is rhyme and reason to it but i havent nailed it down yet im trying hard not to beat myself up too badly for my failings sending hugs to all those who are struggling depression has pretty much been lifted but still feeling very anxious and worrisome any time i am outside i always fear that something bad will happen so i am constantly looking around at my surroundings i couldnt get my panic attacks under control and wasnt able to go to the thanksgiving meal i have one family member who had a fit over that i thought the response could have been more forgiving my daughter said mom thats like going into a flower shop expecting to order bagels you cant expect something that she doesnt have in her aaaahhhhwise young lady seeing perinatal psychiatrist today hoping he adjusts my meds i need to stop feeling like this want to be able to eat properly and enjoy my baby at least some of the time i have someone in my life that has an anger management problem they can be and frequently are vicious hostile and aggressive they do usually refrain from throwing things but they have been known to follow people home who cut them off in traffic and harass them lots of yelling with this person everyone else takes it in stride now im no shrinking violet i can shut people down with the best of them and im fairly good at hand to hand combat thank you taekwondo there is no danger to me other then the fact that i am sensitive and peaceful and find it beyond acceptable or pleasant i also dont want my child around it either i have to go to a funeral with this person tomorrow and spend time with them afterwards my anxiety has ratcheted way up and ive had one panic attack already for which i broke out the valium i will talk to my therapist about this when i see her after christmas i wanted to see if anyone had any advice or insight on how i can just chill out i feel utterly ridiculous everyone else is ok the problem is me whats up with the panic attacks my dad was exactly this way triggering me maybe thanks much for any input sooo today started good but that happy episode was interrupted by an earthquake strength anxiety attack i hadnt had such a big and strong anxiety attack since january 2016 i took my mom to the apple store and boom inside the apple store people suck up my energy i did a grueling workout this morning and i was no where as tired as i was when i was at the apple store major depression i can handle most of the time but when it is combined with anxiety it is literally hell on earth for me feeling anxious full of dread and pressured today its okit just helps me to type it out here as far as i can pinpoint ive either had too much caffeine this morning havent taken a valium in several days and its out of my system or making a to do list for the month of december with 106 items on it was a bit much im guessing its a combination of all 3 one of these days ill learn to let go of the internal pressure what a glorious day that will be sending hugs to all those that are struggling i have someone in my life too who needs anger management skills the effect on me is terrible and i experience hurt and rage the only thing i know to do is to keep a safe distance and control how much time i give to the person what is maddening is that this person would never in a million years treat a friend the way i am treated so the only advice i can offer is to remove yourself somehow from that persons life they have not even tried to put the work in to stop terrorizing you dont let them get away with it stand up for yourself and limit limit limit the time and attention given to them good luck im sorry about the funeral my day was good i got up at a decent time and ran errands i noticed traffic being a little heavy with shoppers im having a little anxiety right now was doing good when the sun was out i was productive todayfinished some cleaning hugs to those that need them took husband and daughter to urgent care so they could get meds for their sinus infections hopefully theyll feel better soon im in quite a bit of pain from all the work the last two days tomorrow is t and pain doc so hope ill be good for that during this time of year i use to plow through all the holiday decorating but having to take it slow this yearwell im restless physical pain and family illnesses make this hard but i want to have everyone on board because i cant do it all myself lots of pacing and doing little things until i cant bear it this is usually a rough time of year for me but i have to consider others as well anxiety still very bad for me im beginning to feel disconnected from my body more often than not i still worry about everything and my ocd still bothers me hoping that my seroquel starts to help my anxiety thought it seems like it has messed with my appetite lowered hanging in there at hospital today getting stiches checked after birth dont need to take anymore antibiotics which is good and dr said she can see its healing so that has made me feel better otherwise i am still having ocd thoughts and anxieties but trying to deal with them one step at a time keep feeling guilty as i think the depression and anxiety is affecting my ability to bond with baby i love him so much but he also triggers me as i still feel not up to the job of being a mother i was more anxious than usual today but im not sure why nerves definitely i know its work related the thought of going in tomorrow is making me feel nauseous got through the dentist and physical therapy appointments my dental tech mentioned that six months ago i was limping slightly and now im not i guess thats good still anxious but that will be over soon i hope hugs to those that need them cant keep attention focused on anything for more than a minute grinding my teeth and tensing up just by looking at shopping sites online worse is that im blaming myself for being like this anxiety is a pretty new thing for me 4 years or so compared to the other diagnosis i have i feel like i dont have a clue in how to deal with itlive with it im feeling nervous my stomach is in a knot over getting blood work ive have had blood work a ton of times i dont get why i am so nervous its also not helping that im hungry but cant eat until after the blood work and of course with my rotten luck i woke up very early i finished my college semester and yesterday went to my doctor for my yearly routine a bit upset because the process of getting my fluoxetine in tablets instead of capsules it takes a bit longer and i have to call to make sure its in tablets again i hope you stay feeling better still in pain even after pt yesterday i now have pain on the left hip therapist may try dry needling to see if the right side loosens up still have home exercises to do anxious about health issues still will talk to t on monday im just trying to take it easy which is difficult for me to do since its the holiday season  with christmas 12 days away im pretending to be on a mini vacation trying not to think too much im on a monthly disability but i have goals first to volunteer then work part time  go to school its real hard not to have that anxiety it literally keeps me up i dont sleep well or when i do sleep its at odd times when others are sleeping im up when people are up im asleep like right now its pushing on 3am  im still up but thats because i slept for 3 hrs then 4 hrs later that evening anyone who says that living all on your own is easy is lying especially wo friends family support but all on your own were you have to make constant decisions  figuring every single step of the way out im telling you its very easy to slip up i dont recommend living like this to anyone because if your not mentally strong or have a tolerance for extreme boredom of sitting around your apartment for long stretches like in the evening when it really isnt safe to go out until the daylight you could very easily lose your mind get into trouble ie go to jail get hooked on drugs become homeless or even death i know what im talking about life is tough ive seen the documentary the bridge well time to fix some eggs feel free to drop a positive line if not thats okay too having ongoing anxiety attacks since very early this morning its so bad i couldnt even take the trash out to the street get to my doctors appointment and am barely typing this out cant pinpoint it today it started shortly after i got up why must this scourge afflict me so any of us its just evil sending hugs to everyone that is struggling talked to t on monday dont feel much better but need to focus on the present instead of the future i had went to an old web site and ended up getting malware on my laptop so have been spending a couple of days clearing it and doing various security stuff im not going to put as much stuff on it now while i want to look forward to christmas im not looking forward to all the cooking it ramps up my anxiety even though i know im a good cook and my husband will help woke up okay today but palms are sweaty asf for no reason i have class today so i wasnt ready but after eating breakfast and getting ready im feeling a bit better im in a mother and a baby unit for postnatal depression and anxiety my anxiety is so high as my husband and his family become emotionally abusive when i get ill he wont visit his son she shouted at me on the phone and called me selfish ive reported the past and present incidents to my primary nurse and she has put safeguarding on my file i might have to speak to social worker im scared to go home as i dont know what he or his family will say to me hell make me apologise like last time so he doesnt chuck me out and take my baby i think i need to go into a refuge ill be a single parent im so scared and confused i still love him but i cant live with him x at 4 15 this morning i had a really massive pannic attack the worst ive had in quite some time its thrown all my other mi psymptoms in to chaos and i am really struggling today i have not been prescribed them just for anxiety but have in the past for anxiety and depression together how far should you take it i already feel completely wrecked and im so anxious because of it i want to run away right now im wondering if i should call in sick tomorrow morning this is going to sound strange but i need some support i was exposed to lice by my friends daughter she found it early and told me i havent had any signs of it and i told my girlfriend right away her reaction was no big deal i am scared that ive given it to her and because her attitude is so lax she will get infested all my signs and symtomdvofvdepression are here everything i read on the internet contradicts itself i wont let anyone touch me i am like a leper in public i refuse to sleep in the bed with her what can i do this is so stressful even with an amazing realtor to help me i feel so overwhelmed i think i should crawl back under my rock where i belong i dont deserve happiness my sister is pushing me to stay with it at least this is definitely my fault can anyone pm right now im having this crippling night time anxiety attack i havent had a night time anxiety attack this bad in a very long time seesaw okay things are better this year so far i have to pay attention to that i can feel the anxieties wanting to bubble to the surface so maybe acknowledging them instead of trying to ignore them will help me stay on track first weirdly theres a part of me thats uncomfortable with how much better ive been doing i mean im not great but im not terrible either and thats a big deal ive spent so much of my adult life worrying that when im actually able to take a break from it i get scared that im digging myself into an anxietydebt and it will all come forth in a huge meltdown at some point second im going to my moms house in a few weeks for the holidays her and i usually get along but her anxiety and depression rub off on me pretty severely ive had some of my most drastic and dangerous thoughts about myself while trying to console her and she has a way of choosing words that are subtly hurtful and bore under my skin for weeks though she doesnt mean them also even if shes perfectly fine during my visit ive had a few nasty meltdowns while staying at her place just from being away from my own private space and life i love her but its not a happy place to me third im still very scared about getting through the first three months of the new year these have always been the darkest and scariest months for me when my ocd thoughts can get extremely creative and outlandish and drag me down to the lowest depths of anxiety and hopelessness i do feel hopeful that im doing better right now than i have done in previous years at this time but im still extremely nervous about the next few months i know i can handle all this im doing okay i have a few bad days here and there but thats universal and nothing exclusive to my situation its normal i will keep managing and keep working things out you sound pretty positive about yourself i mean you know your limits and can contain yourself around your mother as for your anxiety i can relate if things are going good i get scared too from catostrophic thinking and just wait for something bad to happen i just have to think everything will be ok good luck bjornen huge hugs to you would like to recommend a book when things fall apart by pema chodron dont feel like you have to read it but during my own hard times its really helped that being said you are not going through a hard time so maybe its just something you can come back to i think its a normal thing to be afraid that things are going to go back to  when you are happy or to be afraid that it wont last at the same time it is not a comfortable feeling fear and dread one thing that brings me solace is that emotions are not stagnant happy ones or sad and anxious ones i really like what avlady said too i think youre gonna be ok youre a bright spot and with your mom you can set a boundary if you need even if you dont say it directly to her and you know your limits i have this quite often these days i cant sit or lie down ill just keep walking in circles listening to music on my phone but i keep changing songs cause nothing seems fast or heavy enough videogames are too stressful i try to smoke a cigarette but it does nothing it lasts for an hour or so weird panicky feeling thoughts racing through my mind its just chaos thats good newsa positive trend ill be thinking of you and sending you positive vibes while you are at your moms house and hoping everything goes better than expected i agreeyou sound very insightful sending big hugs i have no advice but just wanted to thank you because youve also managed to describe my experiencethough in my case i try to ease it with food i can lose half a day or so to it hardly have the patience to eat but maybe i should keep candy with me or something to see if it works it sounds like your anxiety attacks make you become impatient it does that to me too however here lately my attacks have gotten much worse in my experiences when i have an attack it feels like im going absolutely fast while everything around me is moving slow or not moving at all i hate how anxiety gives me way too much energy and adrenaline so much so that it makes me sick i have been feeling like this since i finished my college semester last week i also havent been doing a lot of mindfulness or meditation lately hello finding me well where i live there are hair care salons that specialize in getting rid of lice perhaps there are where you live too the important thing though is to take some kind of positive action since you mention this situation is aggravating your symptoms of depression i see this is your first post here on pc so welcome to psychcentral i hope you find the time you spend here to be of benefit may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting i hate being like this so damn fragile im feeling awful right now i have to go in to my new job that is very stressful plus i have to work with a new colleague i havent met before im so bad at dealing with these unknowables ugh i just want to disappear i would be so grateful if someone would write me some encourageable words i hope the day has gone well for you anxiety makes everything so much harder you got this i cried my eyes out at my therapist before going in to work today one thing i know im not staying at that place thats for sure just awful to work there i sympathise mat sending you very best wishes my depression this year was sparked by work stress the benzos family of drugs didnt help it was just like taking a sleeping pill if you can leave the job you hate thats great you are misinformed dear friend benzos are not the monsters youre making them out to be they are addictive in long term but so is coffee sugar wine whiskey sex and so many other things in life all meds especially psych meds are scary i get scared as well but we cant let fear decide whats good for us and whats bad benzos serve an indispensable purpose in the treatment of anxiety they are super quick to action other than addiction they dont have any other scary side effect to worry about like increased appetite messed up sex life tardive dysknesia movement disorders ectthey act quickly and bring down anxiety a job none other med can do anxiety is a war and you cant leave an important weapon such as benzos and go unprepared to fight the war moderation is the key atleast reap the short term benefits use them for a month until you get settled into your new job and then if you still want to quit you can stop without getting addicted to them no one gets addicted in 1 month so you are safe there most people end up taking them as per need basis like in situations where they absolutely have to get that extra help to manage anxiety you have to weigh the benefits which are huge if it can help with managing anxiety help you work help you get social i mean thats the kind of benefits that make them worth itagainst the negatives  which besides addiction and dependence i dont know if there are others generally speaking they are a necessary evil just like other psych meds rest its your personal decision at the end you dont have to take it if you you dont want but if you are avoiding it solely based upon addiction and dependence issues you should stop coffee sugar wine and any other thing that causes addiction if benzos can give you your life back or help you to survive anxiety in other wordsisnt it worth considering to take them just a thought used wisely and in minimum dosage that helps taking them in situations where you absolutely have to working with your doctor can help you avoid any big problems that may arise with its use this is my personal opinion im no expert you should ask your doctor and maybe talk to people out here and see if its worth it or not all the best ps you can try propranalol beta blockers as well they are also fast acting and help with anxiety without the fear of addiction and dependence why do my legs always feel like theyre going to give out on me and why can i feel air going through them once i feel this sensation the panic sets in and the attack begins hello warrior i

find the time you spend here to be of benefit may i suggest you introduce yourself over on pcs new member introductions forum heres a link theres a lot of support that can be available here on pc the more you post  reply to other members posts the more a part of the community you will become plus there are the chat rooms where youll be able to interact with other pc members in real time once your first 5 posts have been reviewed  approved so please keep posting im sorry you had this experience perfectly understandable nothing to be embarrassed about it best wishes hi alli havent been on here for a while but have some info i wanted to pass along first of all i do have an anxiety disorder gad but this is what happened to me on top of that the daily anxiety that i was dealing with became worse for no reason i developed ocd and a high level of fearof everything i was afraid to wash dishes afraid to drive the car afraid to take a shower afraid to go to the market afraid of a lamp on a table or even going to bed it got to the point where i was terrified of everything imaginable at times i felt like i was losing my mind i had this boiling rage that i tried to keep under control i became supersensitive to anything anyone said often being reduced to tears i kept thinking i was going to end up institutionalized this went on for about 2 years and how i managed to keep a lid on it ill never know i began to have pain that felt like was behind my eyes i got suspicious and thought theres got to be something else going on here i started taking my temperature daily i always had a lowgrade fever having had lyme years ago i figured that it had resurfaced or i somehow got a new infection i contacted my lyme specialist and got tested for that and the other coinfections the only one that came back positive was a high level of bartonella henselae which is cat scratch fever my titer was off the scale the bacteria had gotten into my central nervous system and brain we do have a cat and my cat did bite me during play it was a deep bite on the back of my hand i do not recall due to the passage of time how long this happened before the anxiety got much worse but for anyone who has a cat or dog this is a real possibility typical symptoms are swollen lymph nodes etc but it can bypass all that like it did for me i told my primary about all this and he was very interested he said you know you would have never gotten diagnosed with this even if youd gone to an infectious disease specialist but having lyme years prior i did have some knowledge of vectorborne and zoonotic diseases thats how i got lucky and figured it out the irrational fear is gone as well as the fevers and ocd and now im back down to my normal and yes miserable level of anxiety sounds like health anxiety to me i know coz i recognize your fears coz i have them myself its a particularly unique kind of hell living with health anxiety cbt techniques are super helpful in dealing with this kind of anxiety much more than meds i am no expert and i just learned some techniques from a few books and online videos of cbt that ive read and watched basic techniques like challenging the thought its credibility and probability exposure therapy thought labeling and letting the thoughts exist and pass without getting into a fight with them and a bunch of other methods come in handy while dealing with this and has helped me keep my sanity intact can you learn cbt techniques form a therapist or from books and videos available online hello recently my anxiety gets worse if im listening to music or hearing certain noises nothing in particular that i can really think of it just randomly happens like if im watching a youtube video and a sound keeps being made i get super anxious or if the music is just an octave too high stuff along those lines does anyone else deal with this where their anxiety can be triggered by certain noises or music or sounds yes i experience some of that i have periods of time when if something is too loud or sudden i get very anxious also certain pitches of sound or certain repetitive noises now its even worse because last year something happened to my right ear its not quite right when it comes to certain sounds and i also have permanent tinnitus in it yesterday my son had youtube on too loud and it made me very anxious he watches some videos where the guys scream and shout a lot makes me very jumpy i am sensitive to motor sounds like leaf blowers lawn mowers vacuums and engines my anxiety is heightened a lot when i am around those noises those videos with shouting and screaming would bother me too sometimes i can be like this with noise depending on what level my anxiety is at yes my moms yorkshire terrier some days i can handle it but most days i want to put a contract out on him his endless barking really ratchets up my negative energy including nervous energy i am very sensitive to noise and unnatural lighting both cause immediate nervous reaction i literally jump when i hear a sudden noise be it someones laughter a door closing that is why i have such a difficult time at work i have to deal with constant noise and very strong florescent lights i strongly dislike it to a point hate would be the appropriate word to use to describe how i feel right now its a seemingly endless cycle with the noises giving me anxiety such as when i become anxious from certain noises or whenever i hallucinate screams or noises or mumbled conversations the hallucinations trigger my anxiety so it seems like anxiety is plaguing me all day long i am not afraid of dentists ok when i had to have my wisdom tooth removed i was a basket case but other than that cleanings fillings  checkups i am totally fine but today out of nowhere i have a full blown panic attack while im having a filling done i am so embarrassed  not sure why this happened to me  its bothering me so much i had panic attacks almost daily this summer because i came off celexa but as soon as i got back on it they stopped and now today my personality is strongly neurotic and im also just a plain curious person i also obviously because im here have anxiety issues the combination of the two can be rather unfortunate at times fortunately i can mostly sort my emotions fairly easily on this stuff and perceive when im anxiousfearful or just interested maybe a little obsessive  it depends on the situation so i guess my advice would be to check your gut and see how it feels hi pixie i have heard that novocaine has something in it that also raises our adrenaline level this is to speed up the numbing process by getting our blood moving faster or something like that my mother and i are both very sensitive to it and while we dont get full panic attacks we both deal with heightened anxiety during dentist visits even though we arent afraid of them either this could be a very likely reason you had a panic attack during the filling of course panic attacks are perfectly capable of coming out of nowhere too which is always fun i was so bad at the dentists that i had to train her to revive me by putting cake frosting from a little tube under my tongue fortunately for me she specialized in traumatized children when i had my lower wisdom teeth out i turned so white and pale i scared the dentist lolol then one time i was getting a tooth capped and the novacaine wasnt working and it was getting later and later so i told the dentist to just go ahead and i never had any trouble after that theres just nothing as strange as life so sorry that happened to you the 2nd one i ever had was in my pulmonologists office he had no patience at all havent seen him in 5 years or so hey i just wanted to let you know that the adrenaline in the anasthetic affects me too it makes my heart race which is also what happens to me in a panic attack as a result i had panic attacks at the dentist too until i found out about the adrenaline since then  having explained it to my dentist they now make a point of administering it more slowly so that my body doesnt get such a rapid unexpected hit ive found that between that  me being prepared for it mentally while it still makes my heart race it doesnt descend into a panic attack i was listening to the deep focus playlist on spotify last night because i had to finish a paper i wound up having to skip every few songs or so on average because it just made me super anxious and irritated gotta love anxiety noises noises i cant stand noises most of the time it just really bothers my anxiety when i hear a noise that isnt a typical noise i am hoping that my newly prescribed seroquel starts to help my anxiety so i can live with some peace of mind it came back again bad for me everything annoyed me todayit seems like it might be impatience like a short fuse but ive had to move around a few times today to try and finish my 8page paper but i cannot escape the random noises bothering me meeting with the psychiatrist on thursday so hopefully i can get some new medication and get a handle on my anxiety finally i have the same problem worried about paper done zanax is what the doc gave me for now it helps greatly i am hoping that my psychiatrist prescribes me a benzo to help with my anxiety because its so rough for me i know people shouting in any form makes me anxious i just shut down motors from the landscapers equipment just irritates me to no end hi im sorry youre struggling so much with this i have similar experiences but it tends to be when my anxiety spikes  i become sensitive too noise or combinations of noise for example more than one person speaking or the tv on  someone speaking ive found that when it is unusually cold or if i have to be in sunit is a big trigger for my anxiety i usually try to work around it but it is making my life a whole lot harder with all the doc appts and other things need to be done during the day has anyone been anxious due to this and do you have any suggestions i have anxiety that acts up with cold dark temperatures sunny days are much easier on me but actually being in the sun for too long is also a trigger for my anxiety so i use those old school yellow bulbs in my rooms at home which helps a lot especially during cloudy non sunny days you know giving my mind an illusion of sun winters out here are short and mild comparatively speaking so i consider myself lucky that its over fast enough hello all hope youre well im really struggling with anxiety currently what ive discovered is i think that its the physical sensation of fear which compels me to engage in compulsions i took a small dose of clonazepam this morning about 30 mins later in noticed that i was calm mentally i was actually taken aback as it had been about 5 mins and i wasnt pacing around tending to my various concerns as i usually would be i thought about this trying to look beyond the well of course im calm im on a tranquilizer and what i came up with was this the reason i was relatively calm and not engaging in my ritualistic checking and mirror gazing etc was because the physical sensation of anxiety wasnt there cognitively the anxious thoughts and intrusive thoughts were still happening its just they had lost their meaning or moreover they werent causing me the physical sensation of anxiety the physical sensation of anxiety for me is sometimes indistinguishable from physical pain its so severe that id do anything to get rid of it however in its abscence i was able to mindfully label certain thoughts as anxiety or anxious thinking and redirect my attention onto something else normally i would struggle or cave in and engage in safety behaviours including avoidance but without the physical component the intrusive thoughts didnt have the same powerful influence they usually do so in my treatments i have learnt about distress tolerance since this discovery of mine this morning i can see just how important distress tolerance is its the ability to sit with that pain the physical terror and not run away from it or try and repair or tidy it away etc its incredibly difficult as your natural inclanation is to recoil from it and make it go away ive made serious efforts in the past to tolerate it and it does eventually pass and over time you learn to not give that physical sensation the credence you normally do however in the past i had a lot of support from mental health professionals and currently i dont have any im totally on my own against a myriad of anxiety disorders and now ive been told i may have personality disorders too how do you tolerate that anxiety when its so against your natural inclination i know compassion plays a key role as you have to care for yourself to want to put yourself through suffering in order to attain a positive outcome for yourself however i really struggle with being compassionate to myself i feel like the world is caving in on me when that physical anxiety hits for instance when challenging my ocd and touching things i really dont want to  its nightmarish yet i can sometimes bear it and not try and supress what im feeling just sit there with the anxiety and reengage in something else thus learning that the feeling doesnt mean anything is true or not true  its just a feeling i just am too fragile at the moment to sit with that fear i have too much selfhate to be compassionate to myself this is more to do with my potential personality disorders from what ive been told as a result of being unable to face my fears i am slipping backwards at an alarming rate ive become housebound due to my bdd im engaging in compulsions more than i am doing anything else i dont know how to get myself back on track i need some therapy but i cant afford privately and the nhs in the uk is not able to keep up with the demand for therapy  so i wont be getting any more therapy for a year at least according to my mental health team any tips for distress tolerance i know a bit about compassion and soothing the threat system with soothing rhythmic breathing etc but im too busy running away from my anxiety to even think about tackling my issues i know i cant get better without facing my issues but im really terrified the whole time and only have escapism or abiding the rulescompulsions to keep myself away from the hurt interested to hear your thoughts c5 thank you for your comments everyone just trying to figure things out my gut feeling is that its just me curious and interested another part of me does wonder though how it might relate to my anxiety i know i hate and im afraid of feeling out of control at any time anxiety is something i struggle with im an older person and it seems like the older i get the worse my anxiety gets i dont see a therapist nor am i on any kind of medication for anxiety or anything else for that matter things that help me to keep my anxiety level down include keeping myself occupied mostly doing household chores im retired  im also pretty reclusive so i have a lot of time on my hands i also do about an hourahalf of mindfulness yoga most days and i have a small dog i take for walks a couple of times a day regardless of the weather we live in a townhome  have no yard so daily walks are imperative i also spend quite a bit of time here on pc all of these things put together help me to keep my level of anxiety down to a dull roar as they used to say one other thing ill just mention is that personally i feel its important to maintain a peaceful calm environment i avoid watching any kind of violent tv or movies i dont watch the news on tv and when i listen to music its mostly of the quiet calming variety i have severe anxiety to the point that ive struggled to leave the house at times my therapist said a really good tool is to invite anxiety along with you to say i know your coming with me but you wont control me the more you give in to anxiety the worse it gets my therapy goal this week was to buy a journal my hands literally shook in the store but i did it dont let anxiety stop you also i take an ssri to help with anxiety and have clonazepam and ativan just in case i also use cbd oil i have a cannbis prescription and it helps a lot i read a book called the happiness trap which dealt with a lot of the things you are describing it is about sitting with and feeling your different emotions instead of avoiding them that book changed my life all the best to you and your journey effexor xr has helped my anxiety a lot i havent had a tension headache in a long time from anxiety i dont worry as much as i used to i dont have as much social anxiety its more noticeable when interacting with strangers now i probably have to come off of it though due to side effects hypertension and high heart rate doesnt help with my panic attacks so i have ativan for those it tends to work as the episodes arent as long effexor xr hasnt done much for depression though hi i have had severe anxiety panic attacks and recently dxd wptsd i was taking 1 mg ativan twice daily for 7 years never upped the dose or needed to july of this year my panic attacks anxiety and depression yep that too started up again i did the best i could until october and went to a therapist i saw a psych np he changed the ativan 1 mg to valium 5 mg saying it was an equivalent dose the first week i about came out of my skin the anxiety was so bad the second week not so bad the third week it was if i wasnt taking anything at all the valium didnt seem to help but i wasnt having much anxiety i kept reading how the valium built up in my body over time and kept waiting for it to kick in it didnt i knew i was through with any withdrawal type thing from ativan i quit taking the valium last friday i believe it was in my system somewhat bc today havent had any panic just run of the mill normal anxiety that i have had almost every day since week 2 off the ativan i dont know what im asking just has anyone taken valium for 28 days and had withdrawalsshould i be having them i dont want to take it because of the long 12 life and thats exactly why the np put me on it ive also read that one hits a plateau pretty quickly and would need an increased dose i had an event w my 89 yo mil in july that set my panic off again majorly and feel i need to do something i dont want to get back on benzos of any kind buspar any reply would be helpful i also take venlafaxine xr 225 mgday and gabapentin 400 mg twice daily for diabetic neuropathy in my feet nothing else except diabetic medsmetformin i like my propanol it works on the actual physical symptoms you can take it daily or prn and its not a benzo i was feeling like the walls were closing in last night think its because of christmas fast approaching this time of year seems to cause my anxiety to spike  has in the past also triggered depressive episodes i have no explanation for why this may be the case today i feel kind of on edge or agitated not in an irritated with people way butfor example my jeans were creasing  touching my leg in a way that was irritating me  the arms of my tshirt were doing the same i had to go  change  im ok now but i can feel my breathing isnt right im too aware of it i think thats anxiety starting to creep in again i know where this is going  i feel powerless to stop it i know when they all come home there will be noise  theyre not doing anything wrong just family coming home from work  school but its like an assault on my senses  i just want to shut myself in my room  hide  cover my ears and they all think im being moody  then the arguments start and they say nasty words and im not crazy im not doing this on purpose i just get overwhelmed but they dont understand ive tried to explain it ive tried to explain the best i can what its like in my head but you need to be in it to understand i just need a bit of space  i dont mean to shut them out but isolating myself is the only way i know to stop the feelings drowning me i get very anxious unexpectedly from random noises i can never pin down what causes my anxiety to go up i also get frustrated very easily where i cannot handle certain things and sometimes everything makes me furious like when someone is texting me a lot right when i wake up i get annoyed and give short replies i do not know exactly why but it just happens with my anxiety i am on edge every day worrying that something will go wrong so i understand that im only a college student so i typically do not have to explain my annoyance when my anxiety is bothering me are you on any medication that might help i understand how you feel when i feel uncomfortable in my own clothes i know there is a problem personal space is a big factor in decreasing anxiety for some of us when were constantly surrounded by people sometimes we feel like were suffocating have you considered how much personal space you need and how much alone time you need for example i only want to be around people for less than 2 hours a day im not afraid of people and i very good socially if i need to be  but people annoy me after 2 hours especially since the holidays are here we can get sick of being in this merrygoround of annoying holidaythemed gatherings thank you both for taking the time to reply i wasnt in a good place when i posted  your replies really helped im not currently on any medication but i am getting to the point where i feel i need to go back to my gp  explain how heightened my anxiety seems to get at this time of year and yes  thats exactly the feeling  suffocated by people  thats exactly how it feels  i have to get out of the situation thank you again i am really not sure where to put this there doesnt seem to be a good place for it so i hope this is okay 20 months ago and for about 6 years before that i had to donate plasma to survive i could just barely get by but i also needed to juggle maxed out credit cards when bigger issues came up i was on a financial tight wire and frankly if my good luck hadnt happened 20 months ago i would be homeless and bankrupt by now so i feel bad asking this but it is bringing up new things that trigger my old crap and is hard to deal with i say good because it only came about because my mental health severely deteriorated i am now in a position that i can buy a very modest home in an area with a very reasonable real estate market this is freaking me out i feel unworthy which i am of course it is the smart thing to do since rents are increasing really fast so my fixed income actually shrinks every year colas simply dont keep up plus owning a home is a good investment and my mortgage payment will likely be less than my rent even though the house will be significantly nicer i even get my property taxes waived so i dont really have to worry about any significant increasing costs even electricity to dirtcheap here i am looking at building a house that comes with warranties and other assurances it is the wise move all around i am cycling through many emotions from fear to absolute terror to give a little idea about it i have never been excited about buying a car even though i knew it was going to be easy to pay off i dislike any kind of debt even the good debt of a home loan doesnt make sense since i will have more extra money with lower monthly payments i have been talking with an agent for two weeks over email and am meeting her tomorrow which is absolutely terrifying i am the type to use selfcheckout so i dont have to talk to anyone she seems quite nice and has closed a lot of va loans so is used to dealing with us whiny stubborn and issuefilled vets she is even kind enough to share 20 of her commission with me which is amazing to me the idea of meeting her is terrifying i understand completely it is a business thing but women usually look at me and run away talking to strangers is not exactly my forte especially women i have never gone through this process but am reading up as much as i can but it is still confusing it feels like i am entering a pitch black tunnel with lots of traps maybe it would be easier if i had a spouse to lean on i dont want to lay all my crazy on whoever reads this but i am even stressed and upset about the idea of having a neighbor or two that like to be overly social  defined as more than a hello once a month i live in a complex and have lived next to for at least 5 years and i dont even know their names and i doubt i have spoken a complete sentence to them ever i really like that so i have my usual selfloathing actually seething hatred and unbreakable belief that i deserve nothing good to deal with but there is even a little excitement fear social anxiety and whatever else involved with all which is new also i dont know if i have an exact question but if you can relate and give any advice it would be appreciated i know some may want to ask how someone like me could be well enough to sign mortgage papers i dont know how but i guess i am i read your post and i hear and support you this sounds like wonderful news im sorry your anxiety is doing a number on you you do deserve this i hope your meeting goes well just take one step at a time im here if you want to talk as you go through this good luck and best wishes thanks well i barely survived the meeting with the realtor so i guess that is good in the past 2 weeks i have spoken to more strangers than i have in the past year it is not easy i suffer from panic attacks on a daily basis im now at the point of vomiting through out the day i cant go on like this ive tried so many meds but nothing helps i feel like im going to die and no one can help me i take 10 mg of valium prn for anxiety sometimes i dont need it for days or a week it takes the edge off but doesnt fully get rid of the anxiety but then again when my anxiety is bad its really bad i got off all my meds 8 months ago micro dosed with shrooms at a ridiculously low level had never ever done any type of drug prior that trip and the next few days were the happiest ive felt in over 20 years now i use indica only weed i find that sativa strands tend to ramp up my paranoia im so sorry to hear what you are going through i deal with anxiety on a daily basis it tends to go up and down so i can relate try to answer this question what do you think you can do right now to feel better even just a little better try listening to music watching something entertaining on tv or watching a few videos on youtube that usually helps me feel better try taking a walk outside try talking to some friends do you have any friends that you can call text or talk to if so it may help to talk to them talking to a friend may help to distract you from what is bothering you having someone to talk to such as my friends or siblings helps me to feel slightly better even if my stress hasnt gone away maybe exercise try to figure out what is causing these panic attacks is it a worry are these just random panic attacks sometimes i like to remind myself that everything will be okay it doesnt help but i try to remind myself every single day im sorry if i couldnt help i wish you much luck in getting over your panic attacks im sorry my panic attacks have gotten much worse lately and i hate it too ive had to miss parts of classes due to it and tend to stop homework too do you know what triggers them maybe that could help you figure out what is making your body react like this and then work on it im sorry you are having such a tough time hope you feel better soon im obviously not ready for any kind of work but i just cant afford to miss this opportunity so im jumping in with both feets im worried about the conflict of inner and outer world that goes on when we have to pretend to be social like nothings wrong so we can fit in with people and the work it takes to hide the secret that we just dont fit in not anymore not yet im worried about my inner world spilling into the outer world and leaving me exposed to the whole world to see how broken i am i just want to survive the first few weeks for the meds to kick in how do you manage to keep your inner worlds from spilling into the outside world help me out here i need it hmmmm well this is a good question i should know the answer to this too since ive been hiding a major part of myself for the better part of 69 years somehow i dont know how i learned very early in life that there were things about myself that i must never talk about with anyone and so i didnt for most of my life i did try to loosen up a bit briefly a few years ago but it quickly became apparent no one wanted to hear about it so i stopped the one thing i know about hiding your inner world away from other people is that it can be exhausting especially if you keep it up for a long time as i have i think that perhaps having someone or at least someplace where you can be yourself might help thats something i dont have that i did have a few years ago  i know i really miss it now the other thing though is that having your inner world spill out may seem like a much bigger potential problem to you than would actually be in reality as long as it doesnt interfere with the quality of your work it may well end up not being of much consequence to anyone else also plenty of plain old exercise will help to dissipate the buildup of anxiety that can develop from feeling as though youre hiding something i do about an hourahalf of exercise most days plus i have a small dog i walk a couple of times a day personally i think its that buildup of anxiety that is likely to be at the root of having your inner world come spilling out if it does so the more you can do to keep your anxiety at bay the less likely it may be that youll expose yourself at least these are my thoughts with regard to your post hello i have been suffering from very bad anxiety the last few months and no medication has helped me yet i currently take seroquel risperidone remeron and the seroquel has helped my psychotic depression out greatly even though it was prescribed for anxiety and my psychotic symptoms i should be coming off of risperidone and remeron in 11 days when i meet with my psychiatrist again i also assume she will be increasing my dosage of seroquel up from 100 mg to try and counteract my anxiety another thing i am assuming is that i will get a benzodiazepine for when my symptoms are really bad i have been on lexapro celexa prozac doxepin lamictal risperidone remeron seroquel clonodine busiprone during my two episodes of psychotic depression the anxiety aspect is new to me and i was diagnosed with gad and social anxiety so i was wondering what everyone who has had their anxiety fixed by medication which ones helped you i just want to bring it up to my psychiatrist to get her opinion on it i know snris are probably the next step for me since ssris do not work thank you i take neurontin and vistaril for anxiety antipsychotics also worked except abilify and latuda my pnurses office doesnt prescribe benzos as they also treat substance abuse cases and dont keep it around i have had success with both ativan and clonazepam but my doctors wont do benzos long term only to stabalize right now i use zoloft and marijuana i have a prescription for it cbd oil is actually pretty amazing at controlling anxiety for me the only medication that helps with my anxiety is ativan but i refuse to take it because it makes me gain weight oddly enough when i got on invega for schizoaffevtive disorder most of my panic attacks went away even though that wasnt why i was prescribed it i take klonopin as needed for any leftover panic attacks gabapentinthis has been great for me im lucky in that it gives me a little buzz ive read others responding that it doesnt work but it does for me it is also prescribed for nerve pain but it isnt addictive like vicodin although ive read it can be abused for the buzz the last couple days i have been having this feeling of depersonalization it lasts for maybe ten minutes a time and i feel super strange during it it occurs 3 times per days since it started i was reading online about it and i do not think it has developed into full blown depersonalization disorder but it does bother me i feel like im disconnected from my brain and body i recently had my dosage of risperidone lowered and seroquel was added to my prescriptions about a week and a half ago so i was wondering if my heightened anxiety is a result of the seroquel kicking in or a combination of my risperidone being lowered as well as the seroquel my anxiety has been getting worse and my next psychiatrist appointment is in ten days has anyone else dealt with anything similar to this thanks i knew that my teeth in the upper back were a bit used since the paste is old and i havent have gone to the dentist in years i have noticed while eating certain things that were hard were a bit discomfort but no pain and just now i was eating pizza and one of my teeth came out all of the sudden i feel scared and sort of anxious because im 29 i dont know if thats normal when i was a teenager i would always have an attitude with my grandparents i was very rude to them and i really dont know why now i have a good relationship with my grandparents but i still feel extremely guilty for how i acted its been noted that ive matured and grown up a lot and im definitely not the person i used to be how do i get rid of this crippling guilt and allow myself to forgive im also concerned that my old friends who knew me during that time will think im a terrible person for how i used to act since they dont know who i am today i am leaning towards my current symptoms being a result of my risperidone being cut down by 50 instantly instead of being tapered by 10 every 24 weeks as recommended some of the withdrawal symptoms line up with what i am experiencing depersonalization anxiety appetite changes confusion if your grandparents forgive you for how you acted is that enough for you to put it past you if youve grown as a person i doubt they would have any harsh feelings towards you best of luck i agree with dowdy you could also apologize to your grandparents to get closure and then put it behind you best wishes hey all so i notice something is wrong and i want to fix this no this isnt some amityville type of story but it does make me feel very bad about myself i think as a child i had a strong fear of death my parents were over protective and i would constantly fear anything that would harm me or the ones i loved because i feared this i would then constantly think about iti wasnt depressed but it did make me feel sad when i did think things like so for instance i would constantly think about my parents dying and how i wouldnt be able to cope with that happening as an adult i am getting other types of thoughts every now and then its hard to explain but i would think and say things i would never ever want to happen at all like if i thought about my parents i would randomly say i hope they die but that is exactly what i dont want to happen i dont know where that thought is coming from i will never wish or hope anything like that upon a loved one and at first i ignored it because its not something i ever said out loud so its all in my head i thought to myself well maybe its because thats exactly what i fear so much so my mind thinks about the opposite in a form of anxiety i dont know i didnt worry about it because of course i would never act upon that and i accepted that sometimes our minds say crazy things but that isnt who we are or what believe but then i said it once about my daughter and i felt terrible no i dont have thoughts of hurting my children or anything its not something i wish to happen i am afraid so afraid of it happening and even worse i dont want to attract anything negative i promise i am a kind hearted person i dont even have any bad habit or behaviors its not something that is driving me crazy its literally a random negative thought or saying in my head that sometimes i cannot control so i would then say as stupid as it sounds i hope  dies dyes their hair because god knows i dont even mean that maybe its just fear and anxiety but how can i forgive myself for even thinking something like that my question is how stop these negative thoughtssayings the same thing would happen to me with driving at first and sometimes even now i was afraid of driving and it sort of turned into a phobia and i feared it so i would constantly think of all the bad things that can happen but i never said i hope i die i would just think of me crashing etc which is understandable if its a phobia i just dont know where the i hope dies comes from anxiety i have a lot of these kinds of intrusive thoughts yes i presume they are the result of anxiety which i have a lot of i dont believe there is any way to stop them there is only acceptance of them compassionate abiding is how its referred to in the buddhist literature perhaps youre familiar with it if not heres a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice i suppose this could also be viewed as a form of pure o obsessive compulsive disorder family therapist kati morton uploaded a video onto her youtube channel on the topic of pure o heres a link to that video hope something in these resources will be of benefit hi guys i think ill create a separate thread instead of bumping my old one but you can find it here long story short basically i am an anxious person with current health anixiety that dramatically increased with the death of my mother i have gone through multiple fears of different diseases and at some point i started thinking what if what i have is a schiz and my hypochondriac fears are delusions ever since then i was super scared of schiz it took me a lot of googling to figure it out but i had a basic understanding of what i have and why my condition is at least questionable to call schiz ive read a lot of articles and posted on a lot of fourms until i found one where i consulted with a supposed certified specialist it was online so who knows how professional he is who told me that i definitely just have anixiety so whatever right i kinda calmed down later on few weeks ago i learned that my biological father with whom i dont live was diagnosed with f20 schiz he was diagnosed around the age of 43 plus minus so now i am super afraid of inheriting the disease and talking to that doctor guy ive figured that what ive had were definitely not delusions since in the condition the believes are so severe that people are given the medicine to get rid of them which i definitely dont need there are other ways to convince me i was wrong after i told that doc guy yeah thanks i feel better about delusions now he said that i am in the hypochondrical cycle and that i will soon find something else to worry about and there it goes literally the next day i first started thinking of unusual believes and then started suspecting i was hearing voices 4 days ago i was 100 sure that ive had no voices over the last 3 days ive had 2 incidences both of which could be explained by something else since i was not completely alone i work retail and the day before yesterday when closing and looking if everyone left in the supposedly empty of customers store for a second i thought ive heard voices somewhere far away like some sort of murmur and it felt like ah what was thatlike when you though you heard something for a sec but unsure what was that but i was super tired after an 8 hour shift and there was lots of noise in the building such as conditioner radio animals screaming i work at petco and it later turned out that there were janitors in the building who maybe were talking to each other and later on i tested and it turned out that i could recreate the exact same sound in my head and stop it whenever i want by another thought or by starting doing something else and thinking about it so maybe it even was myself thinking of what to look imagining it and getting scared of my own imagination for a second since i was super tired and not thinking straight the second case was yesterday and it would be also possible to explained by something else i was ringing the person up and ive heard someone say st right by my ear like not addressing me but like if someone said it to themselves the sound was coming from outside and was not inside of my head and it was coming from the direction of a person standing by me and there were 2 more people within my hand reach who couldve said it i did ask my coworker about it later on and looked very stupid btw but he said he heard nothing but also he maybe didnt even get what i was talking about or he maybe wasnt paying attention whatever so that could be explained by assuming that some of the people that stood close to me had said it and from what i understood its more common for schizophrenics to hear voices inside their head so what i wanted to know is if there is no clear evidence that there is a voice in my head and what i hear could be explained by something else i shouldnt yet be bothered by it right or at least not assume that what i have are the voices meaning if i was sitting alone and had a voice is one thing but another is when there is at least semireasonable explanation right how do people feel their voices also there is a thing of me now expecting a voice to pop up at some point and i am super afraid thanks ive been trying to look for a specialist but received no responses yet i agree with skeeyks you cannot stop the intrusive thoughts until your mood gets better i cannot stop thinking about death even though i know i wont act upon any of my thoughts i wind up thinking about my own death a lot but it does not make me feel down about myself because i know the thoughts are irrational best of luck to you i hope you are able to get your anxiety under control im in the same boat right now its very daunting and scary ive been getting intrusive thoughts and feel like im going to wake up one morning and just be psychotic same ill be sitting at work and will question everything like was that a real noise i heard out there or am i hearing things or ill fumble over the keyboard and be like why is this happening am i bout to schiz out i have trouble in the moment comprehending things because im not really paying attention but yea sounds like we are having a lot of the same stuff you on any meds good luck finding a specialist to give you an evaluation i hope you get to the bottom of it best wishes dont hesitate to seek help from a dr as weird as you feel and think they will think im crazy in all reality we are very sane compared to most i work in le and trust me i see it all the time and i feel your struggle with the whole work thing i had an upper molar crumble out of my mouth around your age maybe a year or two older like you i had not been going to the dentistit was a bit of a wake up call even though it still took me another fifteen or so years to really start going regularly i dont remember how i felt about it at the timesurprised for sure i was eating a cookie when it happened for me i have psychotic depression so it is not psychosis or schizophrenia during my episodes i typically hear screams mumbled conversations tall figures some random words for me i would be bothered by any hallucination probably just because of my crippling anxiety i believe they were hallucinations 100 and i personally do not have any issue with having experienced them its just another part of life for me what has helped my psychotic symptoms the most was seroquel seroquel has completely rid me of my psychotic symptoms as well as my depression i do have side effects from seroquel but i guess it is worth it best of luck to you in getting the proper diagnosis i know that was very important for me to receive this sounds odd but im having anxiety about taking my xanax im afraid ill have all the side effects of hallucinate or something ive taken it in the past but my anxitey is worse than before and now everything kinda makes me on edge im not getting sleep and need to take it to relax and get sleep anyone else have this issue or any words of wisdoms thanks ok so ive had issues with anxitey and depression my whole life im 23 and recently switched to lexapro 20 mgs after being on prozac for a few years ive been having intrusive thoughts lately that are scaring me and making me feel like im crazy i know i wouldnt act on them but in the moment they pass thru my mind and my body tingles and i go into panic could this be from the meds im not suicidal but i have thoughts about it never could bring myself to doing it but it feels like nothing is helping i feel like im going to just snap and wake up a psycho one day does anyone else feel this ever or have experience with it im afraid to take xanax im prescribed because i see things about hallucination which is a big feari feel like im going to just randomly hallucinate as it is i know it sounds dumb but this is the place i feel comfortable asking for help the easiest first ive known several people who have taken xanax specifically as well as others who have taken other benzos all of that was long term ive even taken a couple and none of us have had hallucinations should be pretty safe second sounds like bad anxiety but you probably have thought that too sounds reasonable that the lexapro is at least temporarily causing it though we cant be sure you could ask your doctor celexa made me horribly depressed and anxious and i had a really bad time on it where i refused to go to the doctor for a minor emergency because i didnt think i could emotionally handle it the switch could be doing it temporarily or it might be a short term side effect or lexapro might not work for you great thread im currently reading destressify i will look through my anxiety books on kindle and try to find ones that i think may be helpful not a single thing you said is dumb i have yet to introduce myself and am still new here im still very apprehensive of sharing bt i will say something i have learned and tell myself every time i have my moments death may seem like the ultimate fix or a quick solution to my short term issues however thats what any mental illness wants unnatural death is its victory so while i know i am weak against its punches sometimes i have far too much pride to let that pos beat me if you loose a battle learn from it write down the trigger write down your thoughts dont bs yourself be brutally honest and accept it as a starting point realizing you could be in a gutter rn i fear the same thing i truly do i sometimes feel psycho because in my moments im able to disconnect and not care about my destruction thank you for your share its comforting to know im not alone i hope you have a wonderful night and can relax im reading again a book about cbt its old school but cbt helps with my anxiety i just got through with a dbt workbook it helps as well my unexpected panic attacks stopped some time ago but about 3 weeks ago they came back and ive had 5 in these 3 weeks and its awful i feel really bad and so anxious during them i wish they would stop now im not afraid of them as i know they are random and i have accepted this fact but i really dont like them and want them to go away again i am sorry to hear you are suffering right now are any of your medications specifically for the panic attacks i guess the ativan could be if not have you considered going on medication to try and help it best of luck to you keep us updated im sorry to hear about your panic attacks i have struggled with anxiety but not as much now my anxiety is like a rollercoaster one moment ill feel okay then the next moment i feel anxious it sucks but i hope to one day overcome the anxiety that i feel one thing that i have done is accepting that my brain and mind are wired differently some people are wired differently not everyone is equipped to deal with anxiety effectively thats why some people need therapy and help others can have anxiety and they can do something and it just disappears i think talking to a counselor doctor or healthcare worker will help you the best they can try to figure out why you keep having panic attacks do your panic attacks come from any worries disturbing or intrusive thoughts try to figure out what is causing them i wish the best for you in life and i hope you find a way to overcome your panic attacks im sorry you are having panic attacks again i truly would rather deal with depression then anxiety i hope it clears up soon so last night after taking 400 mg of clozapine which should end all conscious thought in a half hour i was wired for 3 hours because i had to keep my heart beating if i stopped concentrating it would stop because i couldnt feel it i was feeling pretty manic all evening but the heart thing it has happened before i have a hard time going to sleep anyway without the meds id sit there for hours with rushing thoughts usualyl mistakes ive made regrets does anyone have ideas on how to sleep i stay on the meds i keep soothing music playing brain just rushes i take melatonin i am pretty obsessed with my heartbeat too if its beating too fast too slow i hate the way it makes me feel my cardiologist recommended i buy this gadget from alivecor it works with an app called kardia  gives you an instant ekg reading its amazing he told me its good for people like myself anxious anyways i do an ekg  if its normal i know theres nothing to worry about  that helps me relax  sleep i started out in science i have a bachelors degree in the field of geology which was active 10 years prior i decided to have a bit more fun in college and duel majored learning sculpture which i already know was stupid and worthless i then went on to graduate school in geologyabout the time that many of the science divisions in the united states shut down i ended up leaving after a personal conflict with my major advisor as she was very against religion and was notorious for creating conflict with students who suggested any religious ties period this was not something that i knew prior to going to school and while exiting the program the head of the department accidentally let it slip that this particular professor was known to have chased away postdoctorate students she was extremely difficult to deal with instead of going back to graduate school with two other offers from different universities that would have taken me in if i applied i decided to go for something different i pursued animation at a top private college and obtained my masters degree i faced a lot of discrimination there because it was filled with very rich students from very prestigious backgrounds i even put myself into the hospital trying to keep up with them by spending 3 to 4 days awake and sleeping an hour here and there to prove my worth i ended graduating with nearly all as it was a hard road because art is quite subjective and the stereotypical belief is that nothing is quite good enough many of the professors are equally hard on their own work and often judge students to years of people out in the profession well needless to say when i graduated i couldnt find a job anywhere i did here back from a few casino companies that were interested in my art they liked it until upper management and thats when i got turned down nothing in science absolutely zero i gave nearly ten years of my life trying to make a life for myself and now i am a parttime cashier at a local store in the middle of nowhere i have taken enough courses that i only need about 6 more before i can go back to school for premed and all the ones that ive taken thus far that count have been stellar grades but honestly im tired im so very tired all my younger siblings are married or in a relationship they all have decent paying jobs with and without education they take vacations and buy things they like im 28 and eating canned soup and 1 sandwiches from mcdonalds to stay alive i live with family because i cant afford anything much more on my own i have more degrees than anyone in my family has ever had and nothing works im good with books my employer told me personally that im a damn hard worker as did all my parttime employers in the past i can probably get handfuls of recommendations from them but i feel alone and worthless and worse i get treated like im worthless too customers often times come up and throw things on the counter and if i cant answer something they instigate a conversation about my lack of intelligence dont get me wrong there are so many nice people too but when the mean ones come they are downright ugly ive found myself going out of my way at the dollar store or grocery store for a cashier because i know what its like personally these arent stupid people they are just people so down on their luck that they dont know how to get out i understand 100 my family keeps telling me that im not trying hard enough that i somehow havent really pushed myself into finding a real job i havent made a decision without them as they control everything i even call them up when i want to spend my earned money to eat a subway or somewhere fancy like that i feel guilty about spending money needlessly on myself as i keep thinking that ill need it one day its developed anxiety in my life that i cant control everyone outside my family thinks that im a very happy because i dont take my problems to work or outside i wear the brightest smile i possible can hell i bet you at this point you can call me whatever you need to and i wont crack in front of you but it burns deep and i take my failures home with me every night it interrupts my sleep with nightmares and causes me to constantly worry about everything i do if nothing else ive become rather good at pretending that im not me any longer sometimes i look in the mirror and i cant really see me anymore i cant even do things that i enjoy anymore because i feel its all worthless i found that i like daydreaming more than anything else i like not thinking about my life or how im running out of money i like pretending that maybe in a parallel universe or what ever nonsense i have a normal life and a family about now hell i even pretend sometimes im pretty too it gets sadder and of course im consciences enough to understand that im really the me in any of my daydreams thats being either frivolous or downright illogical but i must be worth something somehow sorry for my bad english i dont know which forum to post this so i decided to do it here i am a 23 year old boy who have had suicidal thoughts for about 6 months now i have always had low self esteem but it have just gotten worse and worse the last couple of years because of some bad choices i have made it started 34 years ago where i would go on online webcam sites and masturbating in front of people i was often high or drunk while i did this and i think i did it to fill out the emptiness in my life i did it a lot for over a year but then i found a girlfriend and stopped getting high 18 months ago i suddenly got very paranoid because i thought someone could have recorded me and put it up online it turns out i was right after searchin some time i found some videos of me masturbating with face and everything since then i have been depressed and cant move on i feel ashamed and gross i feel that people will judge me and think im a pervert my friends says nobody will find the videos and that nobody cares i feel like this will never go away because it may belong to the past but to me it also belongs to the present because those videos are online and and will never go away i dont wanna go outside because i am afraid someone will regonize me from those videos i just cant live like this my girlfriend left me because she cant handle my suicide thoughts anymore she was all i got i loved her so much she was the only person who really understood me but now she is taken distance from me to make her own life better i love her and i am happy that she is happy but this is so hard and i think she has found a new guy the only person i could talk to and i felt loved me for who i am dont want to talk to me anymore i have tried different psychiatrists but nothing helps my thoughts becomes darker and darker and i feel more and more lonely i cant get over what i have done and i am so afraid someone will find it all the time i just want it all to go away i wish i never went on webcam but now i see no way out of this i just want to die and stop the pain

posting i did also want to address your particular concerns im an older person  as such there was no internet when i was young so there wasnt the possibility of my getting myself into the type of situation you face that said however there are things in my past that in their own way are as disturbing to me as what you have done is to you so i believe i have some sense of what youre facing oh  by the way speaking of suicidal thinking ive made two serious attempts of my own pc member jennifer above asked if you had considered talking to a therapist and i have to say i think this is probably going to be necessary i know you mentioned youve tried a few different psychiatrists and i dont know how mental health services are provided in denmark but where i live psychiatrists almost exclusively prescribe  monitor psych meds if one needs or wants to talk things over at length one has to see a mental health therapist sometimes it can take a few tries to find the right one for you not every therapist works well with every client but talking all of this through at length over a period of time delving into why you did what you did to begin with how you feel about it now  how to live with it in the future is from my perspective what is going to be necessary of course there are also medications one can take to help with anxiety  depression and something like this might be something to consider too at least over the short term there is also a buddhist practice that might be of some help to you both now  in the future its not a cure but it may help a bit as you continue dealing with this it is referred to as compassionate abiding it is a practice i use myself multiple times each day compassionate abiding involves simply allowing intrusive thoughts to come forward breathing into them perhaps even smiling to them sometimes i will even place my hand over my heart as a sign of lovingkindness  compassion for them after a few breaths i then drop the story line whatever thought memory or emotion it is that has upset me  simply continue to stay with the underlying emotion be it fear anxiety grief or whatever until it fades of its own accord which it does two things happen when we employ this practice first very gradually over time the strength  frequency of intrusive thoughts wanes but second  perhaps more important is that we learn we can stay with difficult thoughts  emotions without losing our balance our equanimity here is a link to a mentalhealthoriented description of the practice of compassionate abiding i believe that if you can find a good therapist you feel comfortable with  perhaps learn to work with the compassionate abiding technique over time you will find that you can come out of this successfully it may well still always hurt but you can learn to live with it move on  find happiness in your life there is an american buddhist nun by the name of pema chdrn she has a quite a few books in print it is from reading ani pemas books that i learned about compassionate abiding one of ani pemas first books is titled start where you are a guide to compassionate living shambhala publications i recommend it highly should you have any interest anyway one of the things ani pema says in this book is that in the pursuit of happiness  equanimity a person can believe they are the worst human being to ever have walked the face of the earth thats a great place to start those things about ourselves that we find most objectionable are in reality our treasure or as one of ani pemas teachers the late chogyam trungpa was known to say chaos can be viewed as very good news you can come through this unfortunate experience stronger  at peace i send warm hugs your way with the hope that it might be so okay so this is a bit of a long one for the past few years i have been scared of many things related to doctors to the point of panic attacks and i dont know what to do ever since i was little i have always hated needles no reason i just could not stand them this escalated when i was 9 when i was 9 years old i stabbed my hand with a screwdriver in art class that is when needles turned into some what this is a self diagnosis of a phobia so i go for a few years with barely having any doctor appointments then one day it is time to get some shots the whole phsyical goes fine then it is time for the vacations i was told about it they hand my mom a little pamphlet and go to get the needles i ask my mom if i can see the pamphlet and she hands it to me half way through dr webber comes back in i just wanted a minute of quiet to calm down but that request wasnt heard 5 mins of my mom being upset with me 5 minutes of bribery which just made me feel worse as i felt it was expected of me to do this later and they had enough dr webber asks my mother if she would like him to get someone to hold me down and she agrees at this point in the back of my mind i knew what was going to happen reality just didnt set in until about an hour after it happened i had been held down and given 3 shots that was the first time doctors have shown me exactly how little they care about your emotions as a minor and it is the reason why i hate being a teen when it comes down to it you might be reasonable enough to say wait just give me a minute but no one will care while i have never been held down again there have been multiple threats to do that each time i asked for just a minute to get out of panic attack mode and each time the request was denied ever since those threats i have tried to avoid doctors as much as possible i still sometimes have nightmares about going to get my wisdom teeth out having a panic attack and being restrained and sedated or the same situation but instead i broke my leg then freaked out and was restrained and sedated i still have these nightmares but thankfully no where near as often as i used to the idea of a sedative being inside a needle or iv took what was already bordering a phobia if not one already and made to so much bigger this caused me to start working out and made me want to learn how to defend myself to this day my pediatrician office still wants to do a blood test on me but if they ever try to get my blood without me wanting to give it i will not be the one walking away traumatized for the rest of my life i dont like living in fear of these people and never wanted this in the first place i have never wanted to hurt anyone just save myself from something much worse i know i cant change the world so doctors will still be doctors and not care but i dont even know how to change myself anything is greatly appreciated sincerely jason frederick looking back on this i realize i talked a lot but didnt say anything is there a way i could edit thismake a new article so that i can shorten and revise this you can just make a new article i think only the moderators can edit and delete posts do people usually get therapy for this type of stuff i have only been in talk therapy for a really short amount of time what types of therapy are there and are some better than others i think cbt therapy would be beneficial it would essentially help to rewire your brain if that makes any sense best of luck to you i dont see why everyone recommends therapy when its the medical system thats broken its good to have power over ones emotions anxiety management but lets not forget there are bears in the woods i hate needles i think i mentioned before i pulled the post that i was in the hospital and they were going to do an arterial blood gas test with a long needle and i checked out ama even though my ox sat was so low and i couldnt breathe i think the things mentioned here could really help you like cbt or exposure therapy or therapy in general as ive grown older and had more exposure to needles ive gradually gotten a lot better with it i wish you the very best in managing or overcoming this phobia ive been totally cooped up in the house for over a month a good way of keeping the mileage down on the car if nothing else i realize its an illogical fear  ive been trying to use my dbt skills to fight it but its lingering a few days ago i made an appointment to go out to lunch with a friend tomorrow feeling this would be a good opportunity to break the cycle the closer i get to the lunch with this friend the more anxious i get i know from past experiences breaking the cycle takes place a step at a time taking that first step is extremely anxiety provoking though ill take a few klonopin before going   hope i dont fall asleep face first in my chili but im afraid that might not be enough again i have dbt skills  phamaceutical aids but im still on the verge of having a panic attack im just afraid ill have a panic attack in the restaurant im about to head out in public this morning in less than an hour for the first time in weeks im going with my wife but im still anxious plus i didnt get any sleep last night whatsoever which doesnt help things at all i dont blame you for being nervous but if it helps try to remember that soon enough it will all be over and youll be looking back on it that helps me when im dreading something thats coming up also like you said its a step at a time and it gets easier over time but only by doing it which is the unfortunate part so its to be expected that the first bit will be a little rough also give yourself some credit for taking that first step because its a big deal agoraphobia is a real struggle for me too i was offered dbt skills but i feared i wouldnt be able to leave my flat to go there so i missed out  i missed my doctors appointment because of anxiety and now i have no meds left  i had agoraphobia for several years one day i had nobody to get a medication that was ready to be picked up and i took it one baby step at a time and went to pick it up i was very anxious the whole time this started me taking baby steps and i eventually got over it i hope you find healing and resolution sending big hugs i have recovered from agoraphobia 5 times now but life is cruel and each time its harder and harder to make myself go out into a world im barely able to manage on a good day i have found that a strict schedule with people i trust is the most helpful external support i did go thru a terrible dbt group and ended up traumatized so maybe you were lucky to miss that group i find that rehearsing what i will do if i panic helps reduce the anticipation and taking an emergency phone with me tho ive never used it is reassuring for me the strangest thing was that after the 3rd recovery instead of chemical terror i experienced that freeze syndrome where i would go to the door and just stand there until i realized i wasnt going out no matter what i thought that has been the hardest symptom to fight because its not there so i get someone to go with me or take the paratransit or make special arrangements for some one to get me out of the door once out i do ok generally if something goes wrong with my plans i do tend to panic again but i have rehearsed in real time in real panic what to say to people to help them understand what helps me someplace quiet and alone someone to walk with me to the bus etc generally i find people very accommodating i dont know if they actually understand but their help is much appreciated the bottom line for me was realizing that this is just a brain chemistry disorder a chemical dump from some traumatized glands and nothing to feed catastrophic fantasies to best wishes and freedom for all my agoraphobia has been on the back burner this year because i was locked up in the hospital for over two months then locked in this nursing home for 5 months but im feeling it a little more just recently because im supposed to be going to doctors appointments this coming week i do not want to go unless i understand how im going to get there and back and a host of other worries this is all chained together by free floating anxiety and rebound anxiety from when i was coming off benzos i didnt leave my apartment for anything at all for over a whole 12 months in 20142015 i didnt go out for the mail or anything at all my friend would visit every few weeks and bring my mail in etc i was fine i felt comfortable but the telemed companies stopped giving me refills of meds so i finally had to go to the horrible clinic i hope everyone is free im still locked up lol it sounds like a few of you have had bouts of agoraphobia that last longer than mine generally do im usually out of commission for a month to a few months i probably shouldnt complain im especially sorry to hear of your situation angelique being cooped up for periods as long as you have sounds both emotionally painful  logistically difficult getting the things you need from outside the apartment i hope your current anxiety doesnt develop into fullblown agoraphobia this time take care i got out of the house today i went to lunch with a friend close acquaintance  he shared the fact that hed just come from an appointment with his therapist he knows i have problems isolating so the fact that he shared with me was both generous  put me at ease this friend is someone i know from aa ive been in recovery for years i havent been to a meeting in almost two months because i was anxious about being around people prior to that i was going to 67 meetings a week im going to try to get to a meeting tonight although it sounds fairly intimidating thanks to you folks i was reminded of my dbt skills  now feel able to take baby steps out of this prison of my own making hello i noticed that i am unable to determine the right way of action when encountering negative conflict with others example would be whether someone yells at me due to my fault or my lack of efficacy to perform certain task or even when i am not to blame at all especially experiencing how someone yells at me or calls me names without knowing me well leaves me at a loss feeling vulnerable and lose selfesteem because i feel i could fight back to defend my respect as a person something does not let me respond with same negativity or respond physically after situation is over i keep replaying that scenario from memory and think how i would respond which usually yell back or grab offender by throat and threaten him i can forget about whole thing next morning but it seems that i have developed anxiety and panic attacks due to these events as they happened in my life and now it is in my subconscious mind if conflict happened at local shop next time that i plan going there i already start feeling uneasy and anxious when i get out of my house i mostly feel tense and cannot be as comfortable as i am at home is anyone here who experiences this how do you cope in such situations it seems these situations are the root cause that affected my selfesteem and confidence thanks yelling is a trigger for me too i just freeze in fear sometimes not doing anything and walking away is the best thing to do you cant usually make normal conversation when the other persons blowing his or her stack just say i will talk to you when you calm down and walk off even if youre wrong you shouldnt have to bear another persons anger i have this problem also i call it possuming ha i dont think its a terribly uncommon response some of us are just not wired for those confrontational situations i can usually find some relief by writing down what would have been a healthier response maybe even sending a messageemailletter if appropriate but it also helps me to remember that most of the time humans lash out it has very little to do with you fharraige is right  sometimes its a gift to not be too reactive at the very least it usually prevents the problem from escalating and might make the other person realize theyre overreacting i do a great deal of rehashing negative social situations in my own mind too one of the things i do though is follow my own advice to them namely calm down i then try to reconsidered what transpired through the others points of view what perhaps was their own leadup to the situation and how might have they been triggered what could i have done differently only then will i if i feel it necessary or a point to make doing so will i respond email tends to be my preferred choice of communication in such cases fharraige i know that being cool and either not respond or respond in a calm state and is a behavior of a wise man but my problem with this is that it puts you in a vulnerable place because later i will have that feeling that will bother me i would get thoughts that my behavior looked weak to other people who saw me that way and they will have a notion of me being a weak i would think how others would respond i somehow feel that if i responded in defensive manner i would come out victorious and not only think about it anymore but people would respect me sometimes i find that comparison helps a bit i mean i know there are people with worse problems in life and they would wish they would have mine problems and while i understand that i still find it very hard to just forget about situation without rehashing and analyzing it its only after that later that i find peace of mind and slowly forget about it treevoice i wonder what you and others who responded to this post share in common because we seem to have similar if not same problem we that gift of not being reactive as if we somehow lived already through all the situations where we were reactive and learned based on exprience and gained wisdom understanding that polite and calm response is the way justafriend306 so rehashing is what its called in psychology i somehow think that should i have responded in an offensive or at least defensive manner i would be free of thoughts that would make me recall and analyze situation and it would not spoil my mood for the day leaving a sense of selfrespect and selfworth because i did not let some dirtbag to spill their negativity on me you mention that you reconsider what transpired through the others points of view how they responded etc that while being in a situation or after that situation when you rehash what happened i understood that you do that while in a situation but i am unclear how you can do that in such a short amout of time let along being in a fight or flight condition actually you mentioned email so i understand it is all done after conflict in my case i describe occassional situation in a public area where a random dirbag joe doe yells and spill their negativity on you there is no afterward contact or email communication i have used lavender oil and eucalyptus oil with good results the aromatherapy i think works because it takes your mind away from the anxious thoughts while you smell the smells i was very agoraphobic and ii put lavender oil on a scarf and around my neck when i tried to venture out i took sniffs of the scarf to remind me to not be anxious it helped a lot to keep me grounded pick a scent you really like and try it it cant hurt but you know whats the worst when you cannot concentrate at the task at hand being in a panic attack and unable to remain calm example scenario when paying small change to cashier while being in such a state due to some jerk you feel as the anxiety and panic build up because you also delay others in line you reach a drained state where you feel the anger of everyone and think what they would think of you being unable to handle such a simple task that involves elementary math being unable to resonate on your level they are now deeming you as a stupid retard i had those moments in life and they really affected my sense of selfesteem and confidence levels on a subconscious level since early years with every such situation i start thinking of future and being unable to handle such such situation as i wish what will happen i dont have girlfriend but what would she think of me seeing how i behave or how about such situation at a dating with random encounter with negative joe doe maybe i think too much but how i behave could determine the outcome of that date or some other important event when will humanity get wiser when will they no longer be selfcentered and learn to emphasize and resonate with others while this gotten better i feel it will still take some good number of generations my teeth were in terrible shape by my early 20s id rather not give details but theyre still crumblingbreakingand worse im going to a dentist in just 2 days and im petrified i too have always been scared of confrontation ive been yelled at publicly at work by people and instead of defending myself i often totally shocked at the events and cant believe its happening i replay the event over and over again in my mind to see what i could have done differently of course i think of all these great comebacks but what goes does it do what we can remember is that if people yell or are not nice with us if we walk away or dont match their loud voice we become the winner in the confrontation because did not go down to their level if we think about that we can realize that we acted in a classier way than that other person z those who participated in this thread described personality and character traits that i share too those are also described in this video whether you believe in other races or not check it out and see how you fit the description of entity described computer voice over is a bit annoying though are we more than we think we are hi key tones  although i am on meds  i still find

i had a t3 at one point  now have a prelude if u r u then u know what i mean i have some apps on my phone that help mindshift virtual hopebox and particularly calm what helps me is thinking about what

things slow and at my pace tv distracting games i quite enjoy word games and trivia my tranquility cd i like to turn my music up loud when i am anxious the louder it is them ore i can get lost in it

to meditate and use this site its 100 free with options to purchase additional meditations if you like it keeps track of how long youve meditated and you can earn various virtual stickers along the way which gives a bit of extra incentive i use lavender essential oil i have a rollon bottle i made so i can apply it diluted to my temples wrists and beneath my nose i have a diffuser too which fills the room with the odour i could really use this right now as i am pretty wound up but i have it all packed for the move kava kava root valerian root 5htp as far as supplements go i also love candles warmers insense any air freshener apple cinnamon lavender or lilac is my fav and helps me relax eating a low calorie diet exercising chamomile melatonin i think its a herb instead of a med stress

a tiny piece of peanut maybe even the dust or consume any other type of legume they can die in like 30 mins if they dont have an epipen to inject to buy them more time or they dont receive immediate emergency room hospital treatment over the course of her life she had a few frightening encounters after eating a peanut or legume without her knowledge in a food shed have to inject an epi pen and go to the er asap these encounters were obviously very traumatizing to her fast forward many years and now she has become very strange and exhibits hypochondriac behavior she will only eat like two foods  meat and plain rice and nothing else for every meal she will only drink spring water from a specific obscure company she is basically allergic to everything now  window drapes movie theater seats etc basically it seems like she wants to live in a bubble protecting her from everything in the world because everything makes her sick it is extremely unhealthy especially her diet and its getting worse as her fear grows she is also getting into alternative medicine from something that seems like a cult from some random leader in arizona there diet and medical advice is very quack like and seems dangerous ive always thought her food allergy is responsible for her increasingly bizarre mental health when one thinks they will die every time they eat that must effect your mental health over the years you cant trust chefs or anyones cooking because they might have touched a peanut or some peanut or legume dust got in the food one would become very paranoid fearful and anxious all the time ive been researching a bit but cant find too much info on it i found one article that seems very helpful but it seems to be a condition that hasnt been studied much here is the paper  i cannot link to the paper at this time because im a new user but its entitled psychological burden of food allergy so you can google it please help me on this subject i fear she will become seriously mentally unstable soon she keeps getting into weirder and weirder unsafe alternative health quackery trying to find a solution and becoming fearful of everything while slowly blocking out the world from my mom i dont have to be by her side all the time i just like knowing that were both home at the same time we see each other every morning before we leave to our separate jobs  every morning she hugs me  tells me that everything is going to be ok after i tell her how im feeling she texts me nearly every day while were at work to check in with me and ill ask her if shes working late if she is i wont see her until the next morning and my day gets worse if she isnt my mood gets better almost instantly any tips on dealing with this i dont want her to feel like she shouldnt take the extra hours because of me its nice that you have a good relationship with your mom my daughter just went to a college 2 hours away and we both had to work through separation anxiety she is always busy at school which helps her and i distract myself with friends and activities which helps me as does therapy if at some point the separation anxiety becomes a hindrance or starts impacting your quality of life therapy might be helpful best wishes im always super distant but more and more recently i feel like i cannot live another second before i burst or implode i feel this pressure inside me constricting me and swelling form my core to just under my skin hard and heavy squeezing out every now and then when i lose it and break down but sitll remaining it numbs me it eats up my emotions and with every disappointment or anxiety i experience the ringing in my ears gets louder and the pressure worsens i dont even know if this fits in the anxiety forum but ive had gad for a lot of my life among other things so i dont know if its connected but im freaking out because i just want to know whats wrong with me and every time i want to be present and experience my emotions i feel like a freaking balloon flying away from myself hello welcome to pc im sorry you are having a tough time have you ever been evaluated by a professional hello i can relate to what you are going through i often have periods of time where i feel like im about to explode because of the severity of my anxiety and it is super stressful because i have no idea what the do when it happens i agree with jennifer have you been evaluated it is definitely worth it to go on some medications in order to help you out as you work on the rest of it best of luck to you im not able to concentrate enough on the video right now but i did want to mention an app that i found that has been helpful for me its called breathe2relax i have an android phone so i dont know if its available for ios all it does is help time the in breath hold and out breath you can also adjust the seconds for each in the settings for me as an example i have asthma so i cant breathe in as long or hold it as long because of my lung capacity so i made those shorter and then made the out breath time to where it felt comfortable with the new times for the other two you can also set how many breaths to have it walk you through it looks simple when its open and going but its worked wonders for me it is literally just a line going up as you breathe in and then wait and then breath out as the line goes down so theres a bit of mindfulness too by watching the line and ignoring everything around me mindfulness was one of the hardest parts of dbt for me because of my dissociation i just cant seem to do it sometimes but with this app its easy to do the breathing i think i have a phobia called sonophobia im fearful of fireworks and sometimes im scared of lightning it startles me i dont mind the not so loud fireworks but the ones that sound like bombs scare the heck out of me afterwards i just want to run away from it im sensitive to noise but its not severe are there any tips on how i can cope with this thank you i dont have any advice aside from the practical  getting a soft inexpensive pair of ear plugs to keep the noise down to a tolerable level during storms and fireworks you could also try exposure therapy best wishes when i was 10 i had extreme panic attacks it felt like an earthquake offthescale of the pressure within me i only was able to stare at the ground immovably extremely tonguetied constantly sweating face blushes bright red feeling i was about to melt to the ground like dying fear and extreme anxiety have struck to the core of my being where i was not able to control my emotions at all this happened a lot when i was bullied at school i have been bullied chronically all throughout from primary to high school also due to the trauma at around that time at the age of ten i was clearly suicidal with suicidal intent in front of others at the age of thirteen i was again suicidal in front of my counsellor with suicidal intent repetitively i had suicidal ideation at the age of sixteen and it became clearer when i turned twenty i have dreamed of drowning myself to end my life i have thought of other methods but drowning myself has always been in my mind up to the age of twentyone i had a suicide plan and later i was up to a suicide attempt but then was caught with the police at four in the morning at home after contacting lifeline it was not the first time i have called lifeline i was involuntarily hospitalised for a suicide plan i really hated of being restrained and locked up in the psychiatric ward for almost a month i could have stayed there for many more months though i hated of being dealt with the police and forced to be admitted to the hospital via the emergency ambulance after a visit from the catt team which is short formed for crisis assessment treatment team im sorry you have had such a tough time im glad youre here i was wondering if others experience this lately my anxiety has been so bad that i am always hot and sweating even when its not that warm out at night i lie awake for a long time with racing thoughts and its too uncomfortable to even put the blanket on eventually after an hour or so i calm down enough to need the blanket is being so hot a sign of anxiety or maybe im getting hot flashes earlier than i ever thought i would im almost 38 i imagine that your sweating is caused by your anxiety ive been experiencing trouble falling asleep due to racing thoughts as well as anxiety about the possibility of not waking up on time for my lectures one of my other friends is 19 and experiences hot flashes and she suffers from anxiety so it definitely makes sense to me as a possibility it happens to be quite often especially if my anxiety gets worse anxiety impacts your hormones hence the sweating i know of other people who suffer the same problem i didnt know this thank you i have this problem in relation to my anxiety as well before i started getting a better handle on it i was carrying around a mini fan everywhere last time i posted here about a month ago i went to the school  study issues part of the forums and ranted about an overlystrict teacher i had from eight years ago who caused me and my other classmates a lot of suffering theyve likely shrugged and moved on since then but i never have i guess i wanted to let it all out but now i feel really bad about doing so what i feel particularly guilty for is revealing the teachers name in that post and why i did it i revealed their name because i wanted to humiliate them to let them know the pain they have caused me i wanted to give them pain and receive vengeance it completely backfired and all im left with is emptiness and guilt in the end i was too afraid to even check if i got any replies let alone read them this has happened many times during my time here i post something then am too afraid of negative feedback or even criticism to read the replies then feel like a complete coward im not sure if having feelings invalidated many times in childhood counts as trauma but if theres any reason why i feel so afraid that must be it i probably will be too scared to read the replies here too maybe i should just leave the site ive felt the same way about fear of reading replies i suspect the replies are going to be criticizing of me and i know its going to trigger me i think about it before reading i ask myself if i want to read the replies because i fear they will cause me an emotional attack then i decide to read them yet a moment before i jump in i say to myself that i must be a glutton for punishment i must be a massochist who wants to be triggered and i am torn between being bold and brave and being ashamed of my self destructive traits then i always read the replies because curiousity gets the best of me i cant resist sometimes the comments trigger me sometimes they dont and they are helpful so no risk no gain im sorry youre having a tough time do you take medication for your anxiety i know first hand how debilitating it can be i hope the 16th gets here quickly for you i was pretty nervous at first even though i had no intention of posting anything identifying so i certainly empathize practice has helped a generally supportive community has really helped speaking of which there is tishabuv who was friendly and encouraging in response to one of my earlier harmless but quite silly posts in this very subforum i guess i tend to frontload my anxiety by carefully vetting and editing my posts before i hit submit but i shouldnt worry so much we all make mistakes weve all said things we later regret how about a friendly hug you see now im going to fret over being too sappy  i hope you read this keep posting maybe youll overcome your fear of reading the replies youll find that most of the people on this site are caring and supportive best wishes i agree with jennifer1967 keep posting and yes most people on pc are caring and very wise however please always be ready to hear an opposing view that might potentially challenge your current thinking the thing is if i initiate a discussion on a site and reveal something about myself i need to be ready to hear opposing views not everyone will tell me what i want to hear and that is a challenge we should all embrace know you are not alone im sure many of us feel that sometimes take care i want you to know you are not alone in that i often times will not look at replies to text messages in fear of what could be said and coming on here i was scared to see what some of the responses could have been also other sites i just always get nervous wondering what people will say to me so i really understand where you are coming from and honestly you dont need to leave the site reading stuff here and just expressing are good even if you cant read replies alright ugh the anxiety my therapist has asked me what im thinking when im anxious she wants me to replace those negative thoughts with positive ones about the same thing i think it helps ive been struggling with criticism my boss hates me to my boss is trying to help me i cant do this anymore to im competent and able to complete this task etc yeah the anxiety is a pain i am constantly worried about my surroundings because i feel like something is going to go wrong i wind up looking around myself like a mad man whenever i am out of my dorm very stressful on me i have really bad panic attacks what has helped me most is meds and therapy i also try really hard to focus on mg breathing when having one i hope you find a solution that works for you panic attacks are aweful i have had anxiety for many years and generally live with it so it doesnt impact me too much however since having children there are some things i cant stop fixating on and get really worked up the main thing is about them catching bugs and illness especially sickness bugs they are both in schoolnursery full time and i find i spend all week counting down to the weekend hoping they dont get sick if we make it to saturday morning with no illness i find i can relax some more it especially bad if we have plans at the weekend  i start to panic that theyll get ill and well have to change plans one of my main anxiety triggers this time of year is the worst with colds and sickness bugs last week my daughter came home and told me very excitedly that someone was sick on the floor at nursery and ive been in a constant state of anxiety ever since every night i got to bed thinking ill be woken up soon with a sick little one ive not yet my husband doesnt get it and says i just shouldnt worry if they get ill they get ill and i shouldnt worry until it happens but i cant help it the kids must also think im mad with making them wash hands and using hand gel when were out and about any tips on how to stop this taking over do you feel you have ocd i know with me when my anxiety gets very bad my ocd starts reappearing i do not touch any door handles with my hand because i do not want to catch anything from others whenever i close my dorm door i second guess myself that i actually closed it so i start to worry about that all the way down to the minor things like having a paper being straight on my desk or having everything in a specific place in my dorm it seems to me like you have some ocd tendencies that could be helped by medicine and some therapy some medications for ocd also help with anxiety so it could help you out overall best of luck to you i hope you start to feel better hello welcome to pc i agree with dowdy if the fixation becomes a problem impacting your quality of life therapy would be helpful and possibly medication i also wonder if building new neural pathways would be beneficial every time you start fixating on something picture a large stop sign and replace it with another thought like wearing a path through the snow or wearing a trail through the woods the new thoughts will build new neural pathways and the old ones will start fading over time best wishes i never know how my body is going to react to caffeine theres either no reaction at all or it makes me really anxious and itll last until the next morning so of course the smart thing to do would be to stay away completely problem is i love a latte and this week ive had one or two and i was fine so i thought id risk it today even though i know im more likely to get anxious on the weekend i dont knw why maybe because im on my own the whole day hi anxiety cant say ive missed you heres hoping ill make smarter choices in the future although i guess its also another argument for me to quit sugar i usually buy those iced coffee drinks from the supermarket which contain sugar no more sugar  no more iced coffee i went to decaf best of all worlds and it has a small amount of caffeine to give you a minikickstart but be careful it can still trigger panic attacks if you drink a decaf when you are already anxious i went to decaf best of all worlds and it has a small amount of caffeine to give you a minikickstart but be careful it can still trigger panic attacks if you drink a decaf when you are already anxious i went to decaf and then tea but i still love a good cappuccino when out and about just not after midday or i dont sleep im sorry you are having this difficulty i have the same problem if switching to decaf doesnt help you might need to limit it drastically to special occasions lasting all day is a bummer do you have anything prn you can take hello i currently suffer from gad among other things and i havent figured out any triggers yet i was just wondering if people who have gone through gad have any tips that you felt helped you the most thank you i feel better since ive started the lithium but it is really too soon to tell my pdoc felt it would help with the anxiety as well as other symptoms im also trying dbt  there are a couple of threads in the depression forum here on this site hang in there i cant stand the anxiety i know it is so hard i forgot to add i like gabapentin too for anxiety it isnt addictive like valiumbenzos although it can be abused sorry this is mostly just a rant does anyone else get so many physical symptoms from anxiety and depression mostly upset stomach ibs and exhaustion that you find it hard to know if something is just psychological or if youre actually sick nauseau and digestion issues have just become completely normal for me since i usually experience some strange symptoms every day or every other day so i ignored my upset stomach while i was grocery shopping figuring it was just anxiety or maybe all the surpressed stress from the past week coming out didnt buy any foods that would be good for when youre really ill but now i think it might not just be a psychological thing as my stomach seems worse than usual and there is no reason for me to be anxious but then i also have emotophobia so i panick easily when i think i might be really sick so then more anxiety rushes it and it makes it even harder to figure out whats going on im not sure if this post is making any sense at all right now but maybe someone recognizes the problem and can share my misery hey yall im katt im 27 and i have never had a license lately ive been having to drive short distances because my husband license is suspended i was doing so well that i thought i was ready to get my license it turns out i was wrong i had to go pick him up from work monday which is about a 15 to 20 min drive with 5pm traffic i could tell the whole drive there that i was breathing extremely heavy but i just kept breathing once i got to his job and got out of the car i had the worse panic attack ive had in awhile thankfully he was more then happy to drive back and let me calm down i guess the good news is i now know how long i can drive for before it becomes too much i am still planning on getting my drivers license soon i know from asking around that the driving test itself consents of just making a loop  only takes about 10min dont let fear keep you from being free i have ibs and anxiety triggers it 810 times it started when i was 8 my parents would have to carry around pepto if we were on a long car ride because it would make me flip heart racing hyperventilating whole 9 yards ive been on a few rx meds for it however a lot of gi illnesses can also seem just like ibs and can be very harmful if not treated i would see a gi dr to rule out anything else but maybe talk to your dr in the mean time for something to treat the symptoms i know it sucks theres days where im so sick i cant leave the house totally miserable wait why are you driving if you dont have a license driving a car is a huge responsibility if youre that scared maybe you should take a few lessons with an actual instructor instead of driving on your own im sorry this is probably not what you wanted to hear but i am confused as to why someone who doesnt feel comfortable driving and doesnt even have a license is driving a car i do believe that my anxiety has been messing with my stomach it definitely is overwhelming and i know its not typical for me because growing up i was never sick anxiety and depression sure does beat me up physically and emotionally such as whenever one of my lectures is finished i have to go back to my dorm room and lay down for about 10 minutes because of the over stimulation of just being outside and in public well i didnt have a choice about having to go pick up my husband uber wouldnt expect his debit card and i couldnt make him walk 15 miles home the other little trips ive been doing are only like 5 minute drives i usually only drive one way with my husband driving the other  thats because im trying to get more comfortable with driving and seeing what my limits are as well as he has a suspended license tbh id much rather get a ticket or go to jail then have him do so plus its would be my first offense so basically its out of necessity at this point is it possible for your husband to use public transportation or carpool with a friend i get it but its not worth the risk for practice start driving early in the mornings or when theres less traffic and have your accompany husband you once you get comfortable try driving when theres more people out on the road good luck on your driving endeavor awww i think they put you to sleep for that i believe i dont blame you for not wanting that but give it some thought and find a dr that will listen to your concerns and take you seriously are you on any meds some meds made me grind my teeth at first if they were too activating are you on anything for your anxiety i find that if i take my anxiety meds it settles my stomach but ibs is also exasperated by what we eat anything spicy or alcohol can really do a number on you if i go out and drink one night my stomach really reacts the next day i would try following a bland diet and see if that helps google ibs diet good luck and hope you feel better nope not on any meds it could be seasonal autumnwinter is always a tough time for me but ive never had the clenched teen before and overall id say im managing better this year than i did last year so far at least the ibs seems to have calmed down again after the weekend but ive still been feeling blegh all week something different every day i relate but i tend not to put it down to my anxiety coz i tend to think my anxiety is not that bad when i guess it really is hope you feel better take care i made an angry reply to someone because i was annoyed and she told me to get a chill pill thats the only time ive had someone be rude to me but apart from that ive had mostly had a positive experience on here i understand your situation with clonazepam i had the same experience plus it takes longer to kick in than xanax and valium ive tried proprolanol and buspar they didnt work for me i eventually came back to valium 10 mg prn i hope you find something that works for you and helps with your anxiety hello i am new here and a little nervous i am 22and since around the age of 17 or 18 i had this phobia of being a pedophile i dont tell many people because people make this assumption that i am i had this fear because all my life i could never understand how people can be so sick and evil to hurt an innocent child so i said to myself imagine being the most evil and repulsive thing on this earth and presto my fear begun as a college student i never had a relationship with a woman and i am still a virgin so often i get urges i try not to be a chronic masturbator so i do it about once or twice a month sometimes i can go for 6 months without it anyway my fear of pedophiles scare me so much that the unthinkable happens when i fantasize about women during masturbation sick images of kids cross my mind the more i try to refrain from them the more they pop in i never fondled molested or beat a child nor ever intend to as a sociology major i even hope to work with them a lot of children are being taken advantage of and i hoped to look after them some day i once spoke to a college counselor who mentioned the difference between merging reality and fantasy in fact i even got mad because i said this is not a fantasy there unwanting thoughts that interrupt my healthy fantasies i cant figure out if i would never hurt a child why do i feel as if i just committed the most evil act ever ive had it too from my experience i think its my body fearing something in my life whether its about work or at home dont get upset with me but i think your counselor was onto something just worded it horribly i dont think it was meant as a good fantasy no of course you dont want to think of children in that way but consider the existence of a negative fantasy just like how you can have good dreams and nightmares with the umbrella term dreams i think what she mean to say is that this is somewhat of a self fulfilling prophesy such as you are always afraid of thinking becoming a pedophile so when youre subconscious is left alone it remember whatever frequent thought you had it doesnt pick up on the negative connotations you think of it with it just takes the personplacething as it is my phobia is very different from your needles so i dont know if this will help any if you get an image that invades what you planned to fantasize about can you say to yourself ok thats not what i want and replace it with a new image i think by refrainingfighting its on your mind more again im not saying on your mind in a good way which puts the image there also im not a doctor by any sense but to me and my limited experience this almost sort of sounds like ocd or pure o because there is no compulsion behind it maybe some of the therapies for that would help you from obsessing about your fear can you try to focus on the ways in which you dowant to interact with children focus on the healthy behaviours curiosity does this lead you to avoid contact with children are you afraid you would hurt a woman if you were in a relationship with her thus avoiding the area all together your so right tsol i was hard on the counselor i should have seen how she was wording it interestingly enough i do try to replace the image sometimes what calms me down is the fact that i shrug the image off and replace it right before ejaculation thank goodness and yes i now feel that i have to restrict myself around children nor because ill sickly enjoy something but i just get weirded out sometimes i can go6 months with a clear head but even if i shrug the image off its like my subconscious is saying too late your still a bad person i often do feel bad around women like i am gonna do something to dislike me so i keep my distance i dont thing you were too hard on the counselor as a counselor she should have been more careful with her wording you might have better luck with a different one i think if you are already replacing the image the more you work at it the quicker youll be able to get rid of it until one day you will have smooshed it before you even knew what it was do you think being around a place with woman and children would help a busy public place so you dont make yourself too uncomfortable but being in the area and taking note of the fact that you arent having those thoughts do you have other unwanted thoughts and do you have rituals that you feel compelled to perform what you wrote sounds very ocd to me people with ocd often obsess over the possibility of doing something terrible like raping or murdering someone if you do have ocd it can usually be treated with therapy i wish you well although we cant diagnose anyone here ive heard this similar thought process enough to speculate this is called intrusive thought and secretum is correctits a form of ocd called obsessive thinking i highly doubt you would ever harm a child or have desire for a child intrusive thoughts are always involving the opposite of what you would normally do such as incest being gay if the person is insecure with hisher sexuality etc it usually involves taboo or undesirable thoughts  the best example i usually give is  if im taking out the garbage and all of a sudden i imagine myself eating the disgusting garbage does this mean im a garbage eater  well no  so if youre repelled by the thought then you actually dont want to harm children its quite the opposite youre actually afraid of harming children and your mind in playing tricks on you youre not feeling desire for kids  remember these kind of thoughts dont represent your true intentions consult with a therapist and ask about intrusive thoughts youre going to be fine and i dont feel these thoughts are even a fantasy just invasive intrusive thoughts hi av88 just thought id let you know that ive had the same experience as you i started having intrusive thoughts around this very topic as well as awful thoughts of animal torture and thinking i was racist its incredibly frightening and i completely sympathize i havent been diagnosed with ocd but i do wonder if this is whats causing it i hope you can work through this with a therapist thank you for the replys everyone i appreciate it i admire the examples you gave methis explains why when the thoughts come i twitch my head to the side to start all over sometimes when i clear my head i envision a sky with clouds almost to substitute the image and for some awkward reason it helps when i look at the time the time as to be a nice round number like 305 or 510 i never thought about the concept of rituals till recently ive been having severe panic that are so bad that i sometimes i feel even faint or like pulling out my hair any way to calm down cause my meds only help a little and show can i stop them from becoming severe  i hope posting this isnt a mistake ive been a member of psych central for three years but have barely made over fifty posts due to my anxiety of being judged this is one of the safest sites ive seen online but humans are complex creatures and theres always going to be people out there who enjoy sewing discord aka trolls as a result i have barely commented in my three years of being a member here im so frightened of negative feedback and would rather avoid it all truth is a few years ago somebody made a post on this very site describing themselves as the only real person in the world the post got a few comments ranging from cool acquiescence to negativity and i myself made a slightly snappish reply telling them they didnt think of the consequences of writing a potentially offensive post before hitting submit to this day i still wonder if i did the right thing and if i hurt their feelings thinking of my comment makes me feel like i deserve to be judged and condemned i want to talk about my issues but im too afraid but then i thought what if i talked about my anxiety of posting instead still i feel scared right now thinking of what kind of comments i might get ive come out to people in the past looking for help and received only scorn in return i understand what youre talking about to some degree ive kind of had to force myself to be active on this site it got easier after a while even right now im a little concerned that im posting in a subforum that ive never posted in i feel like it isnt my place to just show up and start talking but your post struck a chord with me ive sent a few private messages here and there on pc and even though each one was met with friendliness i still am asking myself if it was okay that i took that step and initiated a conversation im always questioning if i did the right thing or if i just ended up irritating people fortunately the trolls and such seem very few and far between on this site i really dont think anyone will be judging you for making this post im happy you did too if you feel like it some day tell me your story zero judgement here im happy that you posted there will be no judgement from me yes post away this is a very safe environment and i enjoy my time here i think there are a lot of people on here that feel the same but just have never mentioned it i myself end up deleting a lot of posts before i submit them because at times i feel my responses arent overly helpful due to emotional numbing or just not being in a place where im able to effectively communicate what i want to say i had some of the same worries as you but through posting more ive found everyone has been really supportive not one person has judged and even when posts have been a little offensive people have given comments in a really nice helpful way acknowledging that the person who wrote it was hurting youll be fine here post away thanks for the help lynn i have a lot to think about thank you nemo you know when stuff like this usually happens i try to look for a positive outlook but it gets so bad that my mind tells me that because your trying to look for a positive out reach your being bad for looking for an excuse i do appreciate the help hello i know its been so many years just wondering how are you doing did you get a solution to stop thinking negative i have the same issue im 23 years old and i was a victim from a pedophile and 3 to 4 months ago i had depression and suddently i cant stop thinking about how bad a person could be to children now i am thinking of it all the time and im even scared to be one so everytime i see a baby o a child i automaticly think bad things no judgement we are all here to try and be better and to support our peers i encourage you to post often it is part of your support group im glad you are here blue well i am going to be very honest with you you will not be judged but that does not mean that you will personally not perceive a feedback as judgement does it make sense if you are this sensitive of being judged there is a possibility that you might end up thinking that you are judged when in fact you are not on the other hand here is somewhat an opposing view when a member op initiates a thread on pc and reveals something intimate about herhimself the op also has to acknowledge that not every single reply will be what shehe wants to hear there may potentially be some feedback that challenges the ops thinking and it okay in fact i personally embrace a challenging perspective as long as it comes from a caring and a kind place i guess what i am trying to say is that not every response will please the ops ego and that is a beneficial thing we are here for you hello my anxiety has recently gotten super worse everywhere i go i am hypervigilant about my surroundings as in i wind up looking around me and cannot stop that feeling that something is about to go horribly wrong the other day i looked in the mirror and did not even recognize myself because of the bags under my eyes and how scared i actually looked with the social anxiety tacked onto my gad every time i step outside i have this constant feeling of hypervigilance even in rooms that i typically feel comfortable in and know that everything will be fine has anyone else felt this way im even looking around me as im typing this for 12 years ive been getting infrequent episodes of pretty intense chest pain that i believe is totally due to anxiety i went to the energency room the first time in 2005 and they found nothing wrong with me otherwise i can go a few months or more in between having one of these attacks i have no history of any kind of heart trouble i just tell myself that its all mental and will stop if i relax it does  in 5 to 25 minutes the pain is sharp and worsens when i inhale i can always associate it to something i was worried about sometimes it hits when im driving the car and i have to stop and lie down in the back seat im wondering if there is a med that can stop it immediately i wonder what others do about chest pain related to anxiety what brings it on how often do you get it rose please get this checked out properly to rule out a physical cause i am concerned i know we can have panic attacks breathing issues etc but stress can also make us more susceptible to heart attacks stroke ulcers etc so please dont put it down to anxiety go get it checked out ok dont know about meds but anxietyrelated chest pains were one of the first things that welcomed me into the world of mental health problems ive dealt with them since 2008 and i too have gone to er multiple times and been told its stress i have a number of different types that affect me and one of them has been the sharp pain on the inhale mine however have been at random and dont always have a clear emotional root to trace back to still general stress is usually the culprit ive actually gotten quite used to it i used to curl up in a ball and despair but i guess ive learned over the years that it isnt going to kill me and i can kind of take it in stride i can say with utter certainty that the extreme emotional reaction to the pain made it feel a lot worse at least for me this isnt to say you shouldnt have it checked out of course since you only had it looked at once a while ago but i do get this too hi rose76 ive been told the same thing as bjornen quite often that its stress related and so most people have suggested that the way to cope with it is breathing exercises or yoga sitting up straight and focusing on your breathing i cant remember how this helps but i think it may be because youre distracting yourself from the chest pain and putting your attention towards breathing i agree that the emotional response to the paindiscomfort can make it a lot worse so its best to keep yourself calm there are medications which work with your arteries but i think this may be related to heart trouble rather than anxious chest pain but im not sure if youre worried about this please consider a check up sometimes overthinking brings on stress or anxiety which causes some irritationdiscomfort for me i hope it all works out okay and isnt anything to worry about ive experienced it quite a lot when i was younger like you they were quite sharp and if i concentrated on relaxing they subsided but then when i was much older i had a massive chest pain where i could not move lasted about 12 hour very scary at the time i really didnt know what they were take care it is amazing to me that a kind of vague mental cause can result in such a specific sharp pain in a specific body part i wonder if there is any theory about how the chest gets such a feeling i wonder if its a muscle tightness or what its in the chest and its so severe inhaling hurts but it goes away from just relaxing the mind i would love to know the linkage also why this symptom at this time of life until 2005 anxiety  which i had all my life  never did this i guess no one knows thanks everyone for the feedback seems you know what im talking about ive been checked out twice for chest pains the second time cost me an arm and a leg because my doctors office did not know how to connect the ekg correctly and the machine said i had an arrhythmia just what i needed to hear i was told it wasnt bad but i was having symptoms which then of course got worse i took phenfen so it is absolutely possible i could have heart problems that drug combo has killed people pulmonary hypertensionheart valve problems so i went to the top cardiologist in the area and he ran every test and nothing is really wrong just the slightest arrhythmia nothing harmful but they told me to call if i ever faint that cost me more than a couple thousand dollars for just my copsys and coinsurance sigh anyway yeah my chest pain is just anxiety my chest gets tight like i cant breathe but its only hurt on the inhale a couple of times im glad you got this checked out to make sure it wasnt something else visteral was like a sugar pill for me no relief at all some people have luck with it because it makes them tired and calms them down i know over time hydroxozine is not the safest drug in the world i have had bad chest pains n shortness of breath from anxiety in the past i calmed myself by walking outside and listening to the sounds of nature while doing diaphragm breathing and muscle relaxation later  i went back inside and inhaled some lavender essential oil that was how i dealt not saying it will work for you just letting you know what i did in hopes at least part of it may help i have felt like that  im actually feeling like that now as in constantly keyed up or on edge then it manifests in different ways for you its being super aware of your surroundings for me ibbecome super aware of any physical sensations health anxiety they are both results of the same thing though you are not alone hello i am beginning to realize one of my issues is selfworth i know im worthy i just dont feel worthy if that makes sense there are two things that bring this to the forefront for me right now 1 i am looking for work and i want someone to want me to see me as having the potential to be a valuable employee 2 i am wanting a relationship with someone im in the dating scene so to speak online mostly again i meet people i like but its wanting someone who really wants me too what bothers me is that i had a professor in my past who saw potential in me who hired me as a masters student and then i became overwhelmed by my thesis work i made many mistakes they lost faith in me and i lost faith in me it makes me wonder who would want me do i want me why should someone want me i really love nice scents and aromas i indulge that by buying scented candles right now im burning pumpkin spice and apple cider i was thinking of buying a set up to heat essential oils if you can do that i happen to not like the smell of lavender reminds me of bug spray i do love vanilla and lilac and lits more i think exposing myself to a strong nice scent might possibly speed up me getting rid of chest pain when it happens that never before occurred to me thanks for the idea can you get essential oils at walmarts or only at specialty stores i used to live a couple of hours from midland and wanted to stay in michigan but had to leave because there was not much going on jobswise i dont know how much things have improved but im sure its just hard to find work around there bad experiences with one job doesnt mean you cant do other totally different jobs and doesnt mean you wont be able to get any of them employers dont know what you did wrong at this other job datingwise i feel very worthy but dont feel wanted at all i agree you want someone who wants you back and at least as much as you want them i feel like thats not going to happen though i dont want or need a pep talk on it thoughi am accepting it personally i think there is a big disconnect between wanting people who are worthy and how people are actually choosing people who arent so i could never take my dating issues to be a reflection of my worth people seem to be picking others based on things that have nothing to do with being a good person or a good potential mate hi rose  can you please clarify for me is it real pain you feel or a super fast heart beat  i had a chest pain once  and my heart was going like a trip hammer  my jaw hurt  it was hard to breath and i was shoveling snow at the time but my left arm did not hurt  it felt completely fine i went in the house  took some anti anxiety meds that were prescribed  laid on my bad  on my back  and i remembered breathing slowly  although i wanted to breath fast as i slowed my breathing i noticed that my heart rate was slowing and my jaw did not hurt anymore  i could breath fine i got up and felt ok  but did not go back out to shovel i called my doctor the next day for an app and he sent me to the hospital for an ekg  and it showed i had damaged  ever so slightly the outer musculature of my heart  nothing really to worry about as the damage was so slight  non the less  my doctor called me back in and said  what did you do   i told him shelving snow  he said perhaps you should let someone else do it for a while i did  for a while  but now i am back shoveling snow again  i dont want to have a heart attack  so i take it easy  and be careful if my story sounds anything like yours  my story happened over 20 years ago  i am still here i suggest  just to put your mind at ease you either contact your doctor or go to the er and tell them what happened and they most likely will give you a simple ekg  no dye  no pain  just a few suction cups here and there and a couple of minutes later  you will be on your way home good luck  and take care  keyplayer i have difficulty with self worth on a daily basis some days are better than others but the prevailing feeling is not a good one at it has led me down many a wrong path and will probably again also have sa get very little panic attacks but a lot of dread in any situation so i avoid and stay inside out of harms way most of the time for me its real pain it does not involve ne sensing my heartbeat at all ive had that pounding heart beat experience a time or two when i got really scared this is completely different it feels just how i would imagine a heart attact or angina to feel its like deep inside my chest right in the heart area is being squeezed very hard or like if someone were standing on my chest i had contused ribs once from an auto accident its kind of like that only worse i even tried taking nitroglycerin to see if it helped it didnt thanks keyplayer i did do all that you recommended what you describe experiencing sure is the classic description of a true cardiac episode  especially the jaw pain    and that it was brought on by shoving snow ive never gotten chest pain from any form of exertion keyplayer i hope you will get into an exercise program designed for cardiac rehab you need to have a close relationship with a cardiologist every winter a number of people men usually die from overestimating their snowshoveling capacity please dont be one of them slight damage to the outer musculature of the heart im a nurse and that explanation sounds odd to me ive not heard of any damage to heart muscle ever being described as slight im not doubting your sincerity but people often mishear what doctors tell them especially since docs often dont explain well do get yourself to a cardiologist try and bite the bullet and go to the dentist the thing with teeth is the longer you delay often the problems worsen and cost increases i dont know anyone likes going to the dentist i certainly dont and it makes me anxious but not as bad as some people experience for example my friend has to take a valium before going to dentist the thing is your teeth are really important and are important for your health hope i dont sound too motherish good luck yepall of the time i dont know what it is i can be both anxiety and depression are my battles im never really sure if it starts out as anxiety and then i run my brain down to depression or if its reversed and both together  i believe in many cases they both go hand in hand i went thru a really rough period a couple months back and could not pull myself out of it  we changed my medication a bit so i could get through  the anxiety was kicking my butt that helped me  i still tackle the same challenges but i can take care of them without that dread in the pit of my stomach yes i have it all the time sometimes mornings worse than others my pdoc refers to it in my case as negative hypomania i dunnoits anxiety or depression or something caused by haywire neurochemicals and stress overload i cant remember when i didnt have that feeling mine is definitely anxiety once during an emdr session my t asked me to envision what it looked like and the first image that popped into my mind was a black rotten walnut with an evil face after that one day my t shows up for my session and gives me a black rotten walnut she found i carry it with me everywhere i go and look forward to the day when i can let go of it and smash it with a hammer my hope is that when i do that it means i dont need to feel that way anymore i get this often i believe it is the assumption that something bad has to happen if you have been doing a lot of good things lately taking care of your problems making progress you have a underlying assumption that something bad has to happen my therapist said that this is a way that we attempt to control the unknown way in which bad things happen this often manifests itself as assuming something physical will happen my uncle had a cardiac arrest at 42 out of nowhere the arbitrary randomness of it was very frightening to me because he seemed to be getting his life under control there is no scientific basis for thinking that the same will happen to me when i start to get my life in order but the fear remains hi i know i am not well and think i was trying to ignore it but i can see now im withdrawing and isolating i do this when my anxiety or depression worse than normal what i do is retreat to home  only go and do what i cant avoid and limit contact with others i know im doing this because that is how i handle it less pressure from others or situations or having to explain anything  its protective however on the downside it means im internalising and thats not good but one reason why im here does any one else relate i think im going to have to try and push myself to try engaging  ha ha as if you copied my journal and well lifestyle when i relapse frankly it is already beyond exhausting to be around people when my mood is average it is much more difficult to navigate life with the funeral in my head that is how i usually spend my weekends books poetry podcasts comedy shows and healthy cooking i have to admit i have been isolating myself for almost a decade now it has consequences such as lack of social support luckily i enjoy my solitude but as i said while it is comfortable it impacted my depression in a negative way therefore i have been pushing myself to have dinner with friends once or twice a month and go to the gym every day it is really hard work to push myself to do these things but at the end it helps me handle the dark pit that i pushed myself in thank you for your reply  not glad you can relate but also glad someone relates im never that social anyway but just get worse when im worse anyway i pushed myself to drop in to a friends today i hadnt seen in awhile and had a cuppa and caught up for an hour i managed that ok but then had huge anxiety this evening so glad i was home then it was only an hour but at least it was something  when i am at my worst i also pull away and isolate which isnt tough to do i really only go to work and have no friends so yes i do this as well i do this when my anxiety and depression are really bad youre not alone i absolutely relate its common behavior when people feel they cant cope or get discouraged particularly with the combination of anxiety and depression its given the name avoidance when it becomes problematic yes you need to gently encourage yourself to reengage with people and things it helps to work your way up from smaller and easier things im glad to hear you were able to spend some time with a friend i have this as well i am constantly worried something is going to go wrong where i assume it has to go wrong just because of how my anxiety and depression make me feel this persistent feeling of worry and dread makes me superaware of my surroundings the best i can describe it is as hypervigilance this feeling is very taxing on the mind at least for me this might be the silliest question ever but help me seriously i might have to go to a friends birthday related party this weekend shes turning 18 and invited me and my other friend as well as other people i have never met problem is im an anxious mess i dont know if i should drink or what people do at parties do i talk to people or is it okay if i just hide in a corner what do i do help how does one with social anxiety go to a party without being scared and awkward ps 1 i could just stay home but im afraid my friend will take it badly and the other friend i promised to go with would not be happy ps 2 therell be boys there and ive literally never been in any situation where boys are present that isnt school i dont like them and they make me terrified for no reason make me not embarrass myself pls i would discuss this with the dr that prescribed you the meds if you havent already if its not working for you it may be time to adjust dosage or try a new med have you tried mindfulnessgrounding techniques they are supposed to help with anxiety ive has some success with some of them but am bad at sticking with them and recognizing when i need to start using them i get anxious at parties too but have a couple of things i have done i hope these help you one option is to tell the friend you promised to go with or the birthday friend that you get anxious at parties you would have to decide how comfortable you feel telling either one of them by letting a friend know they can help you get through the party if they are truly a good friend it gives you support and someone to be around to help make you feel more at ease they might even appreciate having you help them get through the party too another option is to decide not to go you do have the right to decide and never have to when i do that i try to make sure the person knows it doesnt have anything to do with them a third option is to go to the party and if it turns out awkward find a way to exit without much notice ive left parties by quietly telling the person that i wasnt feeling great and was leaving early i was not able to speak in school until about fourth or fifth grade i was dramatically mute in preschool i remember that i did not feel a single thing i was very detached i just existed without any feelings i got depressed in high school and didnt speak unless necessary and scripted at home or school i wonder if i was scared or detached or both i am angry that no one helped me with these things even though they could see that i was not normal and if it is actually social anxiety or a reaction to home life and terrifying parents i suppose the school environment was uniquely terrifying in its own right and i am wondering how this translates as an adult if i snap away i will forget to do everything and fail out of school etc so i cant detach but also in my social life which is almost nonexistent i dont like to have unfamiliar conversations and new people saying hi how are you is fullfilling enough everything is such a chore now when i talk it feels like sometimes the words are coming from someone else when i handle my parents i gently coach them or i am a steady controlled presence for them where do these words come from they all seem so insincere im very very unhappy somehow i have fallen into the trap of the dichotomy of either being in control or not being in control in reality im never in control its all a facade i feel like im pretending i did not speak in my first years in school i think i did not feel i should engage in conversation at school because i feared the reaction of peopleprobably from abuse experiences i was an observer i had similar anger that no one helped most of my childhood i did have a 5th grade teacher that helped and i wish i had more support like her i learned that i had to stop observing and being so passive i think it takes pushing through situations and those uncomfortable conversations over and over to get more at ease you might be over aware of your words and how artificial they sound but eventually you feel you own your words that has been my experience im coining this phrase cold socializing it means going out to a social function from a period of not being around people frinstance i can usually go to a happy hour straight from work without a fuss im up im dressed im around people theres momentum to continue but i have high anxiety going out on say a saturday night after not being around people i hate it in fact today i took the day off from work and then attended a social function for my work divisioni found it excruciating even after i left my anxious feelings lingeredso much so i wish i hadnt gone anyone relate i sort of relate i certainly get rusty over longer periods of time short term its having the time to let the anxieties rear their ugly head again  bad habits and negative thought patterns sometimes it passes rapidly if i cope well and people are nice enough sometimes it goes poorly and then ill usually feel bad about it for awhile so for me its just the social anxiety and feelings of inadequacy playing their usual head games therefore it needs to be treated that way it isnt my depression as such although the depression says oh why even bother i try to remind the depression that i dont recall asking for its opinion i totally relate im the same way cold socializing i like that thanks everyone for the responses i really appreciate them and they helped i just wanted to add 3 apps that have helped me with anxiety mindshiftvirtual toolbox and calm i hope you find solutions that work for you best wishes hi i was told by my old therapist that theres a possibility that i could have social anxiety disorder i wasnt all too sure about that because ive never had a panic attack before when i see the word anxiety i automatically think panic attacks i know that im socially inept and awkward but i was just wondering if it is possible to have sad and not have panic attacks hi yeah i dont see why that couldnt be possible and anxiety isnt just panics attacks its constant dread and worry for me with occasional panic attacks most social anxiety is people think theyre going to do something embarrassing or faint or something in front of others and just kinda dwell on that or a number of other things just my two cents but then again you could just be shy im a little awkward sometimes too and worry what people think about me  thanks for answering i know for a fact that im not just shy i worry way to much about what other people think about me and other things that go with social interaction i have social anxiety and i rarely have panic attacks i have social anxiety and almost never have panic attacks instead i just avoid social situations to an extreme degree same herehavent officially been diagnosed but i believe i have always suffered from sad  ive never had a panic attack either ive had social anxiety since i was a toddler almost all my life i never had panic attacks my social anxiety was sufficient to cause me extreme sensitivity and isolation as a child i think that right there means it is a disorder for you also i would say the same thing i forced myself out into the world and i came to seem to function normal at times that doesnt mean it isnt there underneath i think that if anyone has had real social anxiety when they were young they will always have it as a factor to be contended with some years ago i developed something new i began getting pretty serious chest pain when i am extremely anxious about anything social or otherwise i had it two mornings ago worrying about my finances i think people manifest anxiety in different ways anxiety can fuel all kinds of symptoms i dont think that not having panic attacks means you dont have a serious anxiety disorder my anxiety disorder lasted for many years into adulthood before causing the chest pain i think you yourself are the best judge of whether your anxiety in social situations is a big enough bother to say itthat rises to the level of a pervasive disorder do you plan things you do sometimes based around trying to avoid getting social situations to an extent that just is not normal in cafeterias i was always afraid that if i went to join people to eat they might not want me at their table now i force myself to join others and it has gotten much easier still the anxiety just comes through in other ways i think it is fear of rejection dont let it control you try and do things that seem a bit difficult sometimes you will be hurt tell yourself thats not the end of the world when it happens good luck skyscraper there is no ifs or ands about it social anxiety has a strangle hold on you if your therapist is still mulling this over    trying to decide well  maybe your therapist needs to wake up and pay attention i hate it when people get paid to occupy a chair and there is no accountability to demonstrate in a measurable way that they are assisting you to improve still i been there and done that it seems so nice when you have fear of rejection to have someone in front of you who you dont have a big fear of rejection from that does not mean the process is doing you one dang bit of good only thing that helped me was partial hospitalization cause i was forced to interact with others i had the option of coming home for lunch in grammar school i took that option so it also got me out of recess in high school i spent lunch time in the girls room fixing and refixing my hair and makeup now and then i would go into a stall so my presence at the mirror would seem so constant but i have an ornery streak one day after a year of this i was just so dang hungry i said to myself im getting something to eat no matter what it costs my pride got my tray of food and sat at an empty table oh did that lunch taste good i think i read a magazine while eating i did that for weeks till a nice girl in my english class came and gave me a formal invitation to join her table she kept doing that every day one day she said dont make me come and get you all the time you know where we eat so just come on over she was a rare person and i trusted her and i do hope life has been very good to her she became my first high school friend and it wasnt out of pity i found out she really liked me she was a cheerleader so you cant prejudge people now tears come to my eyes not sure why unlike you i was the belle of the ball in my on home around my own family when you mentioned becoming fearful in you own home i suspected that something else was different i suspected that you had gotten some harsh treatment from a family member that really wasnt my problem then you mentioned that your mom rejects you i thought  so there we have it or a good part of it recovering from parental rejection is a whole lot harder i would think than getting a grip on uncomplicated social anxiety not that it is ever uncomplicated i wont pretend to have all the answers but i have an abusive sibling based on trying all different thinks on that front i would make this recommendation you are going to have to put up a wall between you and your mom thats unconventional advice i know i stand by it all the therapy in the world  even if your mom would go which she wont  is going to change nothing if you can still love her  thats fine your wall can have some windows in it you can watch her through the windows let her have a peak at you now and then say good morning and good night warmly to her if that seems to work okay by a wall i mean dont let her engage you on her terms since you are still young that is going to be hard  for you maybe impossible i take it you still live with her i had to do that with my father from about age 16 and i did love my father but he was a domineering controlfreak i was a very wellbehaved kid but just ornery enough that i wasnt going to be controled beyond reasonable i obeyed and respected my father but i kept kind of aloof i kept my distance if he wanted to chat with me and he did because he actually liked me he had to watch what he said if not ild let that conversation become real onesided real soon your ability to refrain from talking which like me your probably real good at can become a secret weapon  your strength learn to simply not comment on something that is said to you that is not said in good will learn that you dont have to defend your decisions to anyone unless you end up in court it might not be wise to share things with mom if she tends to screen what you say looking for something she can find fault with stay with safe subjects  like the weather and dont be overly inviting to let her use you as her captive confidant the library is not the worst place in the world to spend your time it was my second home i came to be a lover of libraries spend your time there well i think youre more brave than you know and less strange than you might think  all humans hate to be rejected im on ms and i have been bouts of feeling emotional and anxious there times where i could just cry however im situation i have to talk to someone and just the thought of her makes me feel anxious and sad also i dont really have anyone to talk because this situation is complex and no one knows how to help me and the make assumptions sometimes people are just mean and shame me a bit of homophobia going on with someone of these people basically tell me go to a therapist to fix my sexuality people are afraid of what they dont understand today i had a check from someone that turned to be fraud and then so my bank canceled my bank account due to that and im in pain from teeth implants which both makes me anxious highly and suicidal but no plan just thoughts and maxed out on my as needed meds need some support and tips on how to get through thisthanks ive only talked about this to people a few times but i feel like i need to talk about it now and i dont see my therapist for another week i had one of my phobias triggered majorly the other day and i still feel really freaked out by it im sure some of this will boarder on triggering so be warned before you go on i have a pretty serous phobia of semi trucks several years ago i was driving on the interstate going to an internship for school the interstate here was three lanes each way and i was maybe 12 to 1 mile from my exit id moved to the far right lane so i wouldnt have to fight traffic when i got to the exit i drove pretty close to too high over the speed limit at this time and ended up passing a semi that was in the middle lane as i passed him he moved into the right lane behind me but too soon the semi tapped the outside corner of my back bumper as he switched lanes i didnt feel it happen but within seconds i started losing control of my car i fought it hard but lost control and ended up driving across the three lanes of traffic and crashed into the median i was so panicked i remember the day in feelings and snapshots of images still especially scary was one snapshot when i was perpendicular to the lanes of traffic i remember looking out my window and seeing the front of another semi coming towards me luckily i didnt get hit by anyone else and there was a cop not far behind where i crashed who was on the scene almost as soon as my car stopped moving my car was pretty damaged but luckily i wasnt hurt just scared and in shock so fast forward to now yesterday actually i was out running some errands and got to the stoplights at an intersection i needed to turn through i was already pulling into the intersection and the light was turning yellow so i knew i needed to go before it was red i started pulling through the intersection and from the other direction a semi decided not to stop at the red light i froze up it was like a mirror of my memories of the first accident i really cant believe that i didnt just slam on the brakes and panic i was lucky that the semi was going pretty slow and was able to stop before he hit me and i got through the intersection and to the store without any damage to the car or myself i didnt realize that it affected me so much but i started panicking earlier today when i had to drive by a couple of semis this is the worst fear for me to have especially since my boyfriend doesnt have his license so i do all our driving i see a semi truck and im so afraid of them hitting me or doing something stupid that will hurt me i feel anxious just typing this up even though theres nothing to hurt me now i dont know if im looking for any answers or advice or anything i just needed to get this out to someone who might understand thanks for reading i was reading a blog online where someone described a panic attack as a dramatic occurrence meaning it would be easy to spot someone in the midst of an attack i know everyone has a different experience when dealing with anxiety but i dont think its necessarily easy to tell a person is having an attack by just looking at them when im trying to deal with all my anxiety im often trying not to attract attention i think having other people notice im sweating dizzy and having a hard time breathing wpuld make it worse does anyone else suffer in silence or is it just me i suffer in silence but my loved ones especially my daughter can tell when im having one its embarrassing and i try to downplay it unfortunately i dont disclose my mental illness symptoms as much as id like to for most of my life i would suffer in silence i was able to control my anxiety i was able to fool my therapist and psychiatrist while i was having a fullblown anxiety attack suddenly in the past two months my body wasnt able to control the silence since i gave up drinking alcohol and caffeine this summer my body has gone haywire every time i have an anxiety attack in public many people stare and ask me if im ok i had no choice but to go home i miss the days i had silent anxiety attacks i have a problem with this too i dont want anyone to know issues been judged and its not nice so i dont do ive always been one who refrains from sharing their feelings and emotions so when my mental illnesses get worse i wind up praying that no one notices me suffering i relate with you on the suffering through panic attacks in silence if i am around others and im having a panic attack where it is not easy enough for me to leave the room i just sit there hoping nobody notices it it surely is stressful on the body to suffer in silence but i know thats all that i am used to doing i practise mindfulness i concentrate on things like where i am what i am holding what i am touching etc  and my relationship to them for instance i may be on a bus i concentrate on everything from the cold touch of the bars and rails beneath my fingers to the feel and texture of the upholstry to the rivets holding it together and so on maybe i am holding a pair of gloves  what do they look like what do they feel like i imagine how they were stitched together and on and on bad emotions are terrible i recommend mindfulness for any emotion why mindfulness is strongly method to clearly illuminate your mind act if you interested in i will more explain about it because i practice and feel about it cold air cold water or an ice pack on you forehead or neck can slow it down before it gets too bad take calming breaths when i feel faint i lie on the floor with my feet up i try to remind myself that although i am acting very frightened i am safe and that the feeling will pass i try to remember that im going through a difficult stage in life but that i will adjust and overcome every new feeling of a panic attack scared me which made the panic attack worse breathing temperature change reassuring thoughts getting in a safe position to recover are the things that help me also try to embrace something that comforts you a memory a picture a pet person pillow etc im sorry you are dealing with this in my experience they get shorter and less intense after youve worked through the thoughtsfeelings that are causing them shortly after youve experienced the worst of them notice how you can feel quite normal again although unhappy youre having panic attacks i dont have a cure for panic attacks but i found knowing the mechanics of them can help also knowing it will pass soon helps you endure you might want to read up or talk to your doc or therapist about what is happening in your body when you have an attack i hope you find relief soon i have not read through all the replies but will say this anyway i was having major flooding waves of anxiety that would get the heart racing and then i would go into a panic attack the doc prescribed me something that people use before doing public speaking generally it takes away the racing heart i found although this didnt change the anxiety feeling it meant i didnt go into a panick attack it basically stopped the cycle of panic i was in and only took it for a short time id go back to it if the panick attacks started up again its called proponal worth mentioning as a possible help but of course talk to your doctor about it hi i have bipolar disorder and also occasionally experience almost crippling anxiety as well my doctor first diagnosed it as generalized anxiety disorder and put me on an ssri i think it was zoloft but as we all know ssris can be very bad news for people with bipolar disorder so i had to stop taking it when i get anxious i get severe muscle tension which makes me feel even worse im on clonazepam 1 mg worked for a little while then stopped 2 mg worked for a little while then stopped im now trying 3 mg and it helps a little but not much im sure im developing a tolerance to this drug and i want to stop taking it my question is do any of you know of any antianxiety drugs that are not benzos and are not habit forming an internet search brought up proprolanol and vistaril as a side note i cant take gabapentin because of a severe allergic reaction has anyone tried propolanol or visteral what kind of results did you have thanks for your insight lamictal 450 mg wellbutrin 150 mg clonazepam 3 mg trazodone 100 mg sorry you cant take the gabbies i took propanololmy daughter likes it but it caused insomnia and i went manic the gabapentin made me go hypomanic but that has calmed down ive started lithium which my doc says will help with the depression and anxiety and hypomania because it is a mood stabilizer i am starting to feel better i guess most people dont really react to wellbutrin but me it made me anxious and physically shaky and tense my normal anxiety does not make me shake had to stop that one vistaril made me tired not at all calm i also wish there were non addictive anxiety meds doesnt seem like anyone made an attempt to make one in a long while buspar is the newest and it is over 30 years old hi ive been suffering really bad anxiety for the past several months one of the symptoms im having is pushing my tongue hard against the roof of my mouth all day im pretty sure its anxiety or stress related i asked my psychiatrist about it she increased my klonopin but that hasnt helped at all i asked if it might be a lingering effect of the tardive dyskinesia i had she said no she seems puzzled by it and wants me to see a neurologist i cant get an appointment for over 2 months this is unbearable i wake up with it and have it all day and all night and nothing helps i know this is weird but has anyone else experienced tongue tension like this i hope you get some answers im literally doing this right now but i recently got a retainer i guess mine is part habit part anxiety i am also currently anxious and am waiting for my ativan to kick in it sucks ive had a nagging cough for weeks now ive seen the doctor and it has only since gotten even worse i feel 100 but i just cant stop coughing and how does this have anything to do with my mental health a great deal actually i am completely humiliated by it it is triggered primarily by talking so i have avoided doing anything where this might take place i am extremely selfconscious i have a constant running commentary in my head about how i draw attention to myself for having faults with everything naturally i am incredibly conscious then that i might make people uncomfortable laugh at me or even be angry this dang cough has caused this so much so that it has ruined the last several weeks of my life  all because i am afraid of what people might think of me i am embarrassed to speak on the phone this means i cant speak with my boyfriend and others i cant go out without feeling that all eyes are upon me i am moving in a week and am turning down offer after offer to meet friends before i do so i am even turning down lunch with my son i should be able to say the heck what others think but this is not in my nature if only i had the where with all to do so all that i can think of is that i will be the subject of scorn and ridicule i often hate things that draw attention to me or could potentially be irritating too what did the doctor say could it be phlegm or allergies hope it isnt brought on by stress you could try cough drops to tackle whatevers causing the coughing when youre out and about and talking and stuff i went through this a few months ago i know exactly how you feel i had acid burn my esophagus and coughed uncontrollably for weeks i felt embarrassed going out and about because it felt like people were staring putting multiple cough drops in my mouth at once and keeping water on hand helped a little i hope youre coughing ceases soon i had coughing fits once i went to the college doctor and they told me to take sudafed i didnt think that made sense but it helped postnasal drip they said it was several brands have been ineffective the prescription narcotic cough suppressant has done nothing but cause halucinations and space me waaaaaaaay out at least i sleep well i have been sucking on drops for weeks i have an inhaler from the doctor and am breathing free and clear yet still the tickle in the throat persists i am not answering my phone i really need groceries but am avoiding leaving the house i am that concerned about being the unwelcome centre of attention thanks for the kind words and suggestions so sorry you were told this my husband often tells me to calm down it really pisses me off like oh i didnt think of just calming down what a simple solution thanks for that i never tell anyone in my real life about my anxiety except my mum who just tells me calm down and you have nothing to be scared of obviously i already know that doesnt stop the anxiety dear justafriend306  im so sorry you are experiencing this and i completely understand even though ive not experienced it myself my son had coughvariant asthma for 7 years when he was little and had horrible coughing attacks and i know what it is like to not want to go anywhere  afraid of the stares glares and comments of people around you i used to think that everyone thought i was the worst parent in the world for taking my horribly sick child out in public and subjecting everyone else to his germs but really it was inflammation from a cold he had 3 or 4 weeks ago and he was no threat to anyone i cant offer much in terms of solutions  keep using your inhaler rest and hopefully it will improve please know you are not alone in enduring others judgement its hard and its painful thank you i cancelled my psychiatrist appointment for this coming week there is no way i can manage an hour long conversation in the meantime i have pulled out some of my cbt work things like listing off in what way my anxiety could possibly be helpful and decatastrophizing my thinking its not trivial if you feel this is really hampering your life i would think if your doctor checked you out maybe you are allergic to something or i would have a second opinion to see about the root cause of your cough thank you my appointment is the 30th of this month i cant wait to go lol i need something to help thanks again for reaponding okay so i have been going to school for 2 years now studying accounting i am close to graduating if all goes as planned i should graduate in may 2018 i have good grades and i am on the dean list i have struggled with depression off and on all my life from 2010 to 2015 i worked at a doctors office job that was a complete nightmare from time to time i still shudder at some of the bullying i went through there i want so much to be successful in an accounting job right now i work a parttime job in a dry cleaners it is an easy job and its like working with family i like this job but it does not pay a living wage it is not a career i want to do well i also have to be the breadwinner in my household i am so afraid to fail again i am 55 years old and i am too old to keep failing i must succeed this time but i am so scared fear of failure is a tough thing to have because it means your at the fork in the road on one side there is the goal its the side of the fork you want to take but then when there is the fear of failure it drives people to go to the other side where they give up or never even get started the funny thing is going to the side of giving up is immediately bringing to life what the person feared all along  failure the only chance to keep that fear from being a reality is to take the tough road and follow through which you already are i know how it is to not be able to shake the fear though ive been going through it myself i wasnt able to shake it so i redirected it my fiance and i are working on getting a business of the ground right now at first i didnt like the idea of it at all purely because of the potential of failure but i decided to try to make myself feel fear of not trying my very best to make this happen fear of quitting again sort of redirect my perspective of the fear now all my fear of failure is gone once we get off the ground if we fail we will be losing a lot of money but im not afraid of that anymore im actually looking forward to being the me that didnt give up and tried my best without being afraid of the end result if you can try to be excited for the end result not afraid being afraid of something in the future is assuming that your fear  in this case of failure could be part of the future but you dont know that so you can choose how to look forward to the future try to work on looking forward to the future with excitement and anticipation not fear and worry if you can congratulations on how far youve come fellow accountant here i can see where you might be anxious about the future but all indicators are that youll be successful graduating in may good grades the deans listall great news ive been in nightmare jobs before bullying and also struggle with depression on and off its tough but youll have your education in a field that offers good opportunities to fall back on best wishes and kudos that would be a bit awkward i suggest you just try to act like nothing happened unless they say something was it related to something at work though i am old to be a student but better late than never oddly i found my chance to go to school and study accounting which i had been talking about doing for ten years at a time when i was unemployed i feel like having an associate degree under my belt gives me more options in life before i always felt stuck not going anywhere i wont give up i will keep pushing on and pray to overcome anxieties thanks everybody for your support just want to say your inspiring me to go back to school i too am older but kinda stuck in a dead end career i want to be better when i have to deal with people sometimes they still do they certainly did before my diagnoses i get caught up on anxiety even online i cant stand playing a multiplayer game even a coop game my stress spikes as if im on stage i collapse into selfdoubt and terror even on say forums im afraid less so those are all conditions people do not understand my reluctance to take part in even trivial things the extent of my anxiety may be complemented by other psych issues but i think they are general enough that people who experience that should understand i often get that response from friends and family often theyre right and sometimes theyre incorrect its hard for people who dont suffer from mental illness to relate to those going through things its really frustrating and ive had to consistently deal with situations like this even to this day i am prone to anxiety and panic attacks as well lately ive developed this thing where i just have to check things let me explain im a ride operator at an amusement park and every day the rides go through several inspections as the operator i do the last inspection and open the ride there is a sheet with a bunch of boxes that we check off if its working say if the fan works we check the box that says so then we sign it and check off that the ride is ready to open lately i have this thing where every couple hours or so i need to check the inspection sheet and makes sure i checked everything off that should have been and that i signed it and filled it out properly even after checking it once i feel the need to check it again later on also when i go hiking i feel the need to stop and make sure i have something in my backpack that i need checking for my car keys are my most frequent stop ill be walking and my brain says i dont think you have your keys with you you gotta see if theyre still in your bag and ill keep on walking because logically i know the keys are in there theyre not going to jump out on their own but after a few minutes it drives me crazy because what if i forgot them in the car or dropped them last time i opened my bag so then i check and sure enough the keys or whatever i think im missing are there and then ill walk a mile and go through this again if i dont check my anxiety rapidly increases as time goes on this is new for me and i really dont like it do you experience something like this do you know of anything that helps should i check the things sooner to avoid the anxiety increase or should i hold out for as long as i can what exactly is happening sorry im not much help but want to say yes this does sound familiar there is an aspect of my job which requires quite extensive checking and i have to fight to go back and double check sometimes i dont win and so i do but i am time limited for the task so cant too often i also check other stuff my belongings etc locking doors its difficult ive been trying hard to not continuously check everything today its driving me nuts because i want to make sure my car is locked but i am at work and its a 15 minute bus ride back to my car im also refraining from checking the inspection sheet as well basically im an anxious mess today so this year i have been suffering from anxiety i realize that now i took a weight loss pill this year that has ssri like effects each time i would take the drug i would feel happy and nothing would really get to me while on the drug i had fuzzy thinking while off it i was clear thinking and overwhelmed with anxiety i have realized just how much of my weekends have been spent worrying about my cat i mean i cant go a weekend without thinking there is something wrong with him which always turns out to be nothing do you know what that is like to obsess all weekend that there is something wrong with him and half the week going to work makes me too busy to worry about things then i keep imagining scary things and acting accordingly in late august i became obsessed with being a prepper some of it was due to the north korean thing but once i took the drug again it all went away now of the drug it is coming back i hope this is just a side effect of getting on and off the drug but i dont know how i am going to do it im getting tired of this problem where im anxious from a dream right before waking i ended up sending dumb emails because i was anxious upon waking and not thinking clearly yet anyway its been going on so long now i cant remember when it started anyone else with this i think i sometimes do this when in high stress and im not aware of having a brain injury i cant figure out why i cant find something or do something and it will go on long enough for me to get irritable about it and even ask my mom about it and then i discover i should have found it or figured it out right away pretty sure my mom does it too during 2016 when i was dealing with some trauma in therapy i would wake up every morning for a while knowing my extreme anxiety was caused by anxious dreams but usually not remembering the details of the dreami tend to remember more details towards the end of an ordealanxious period i would wake up with a severe panic attack and sometimes it would take hours for it to settle down i dont know if this describes any of your anxious feelings in the morning or not sometimes my dreams are disturbing and i wake up quite stressed and anxiousand then to get past that i carefully and methodically sort the thoughts and feelings to cull the irrational ones and get back to dealing relatively well with reality i get night terrors sometimes where i run down the hall screaming it happens when i am dealing with stress in may i saw a very disturbing scene in the movie reserver dogs and i had a night terror less then 2 hours later i just wake up really anxious and scared it happened at 630 friday morning because i was anxious about my dentist appointment at 830 sometimes i just wake up scared out of my mind with my heart pounding without having any bad dreams i think that usually happens when i take a sleeping pill yes i just want people to know i dont enjoy it and if i have it stop asking if i took my meds or need them tweaked or the husband losing his temper he says get over it usually when i calm down i tell him why but he still gets upset with the panic attacks i think only the therapist gets it though during this mood i am not calm im extra sensitive so any thought or physical feeling comes into my head is like a jolt of energy and its too much energy i cant handle it regardless if its a bigsmall thing or if its positivenegative doubt its fight or flight examples food from dinner still on my teeth normally this is fine but in this mood makes it worse more intense having softpremature bowel movement smells more that smell is makes my intense mood way worse wanking normally wank fine but in this mood when i orgasm yeah no way its like that jolt of energy again its too much and makes the mood worsemore intense but youd think having an orgasm would do the opposite judging people if a thought of someone pops into my head and maybe i judge them somehow even if someone i like jolt energy 86 bpm heart rate sometimes 90120 but that seems more rare need more data maybe normal condiitons food on teeth is fine wanking has always been normal judgement not saying juding people is the best thing but under normal circumstances i may be judgemental and thats the end of it 78 bpm heart rate after eating and 90120 after workout workout can be a bowel movement  mood trigger too but it was never a trigger before all of this started softpremature bowel movements are a trigger its the bowel movement feeling not the movement itself which is trigger can happen without bowel feeling but its a bit rarer perhaps its interfering with gut chemicals but thats a trigger so possible exception to the examples above if im out somewhere and people fight and i freeze once the fight stops i walk around for a bit with jelly legs so thats freeze or fight or flight all adrenaline related i do not have jelly legs with this mood i can still walk around can usually drive cant sleep with this mood even if bone tired drift off start dreams wake up in 5mins once the mood dies out or passeswhich can sometime take 6hours then i can sleep easy so it doesnt stop sleep chemicals but it does stop from falling asleep same with appetite appetite can come back once this mood passes going and seeing a friendfamily member usually stops this mood in the moment unsure why release of endorphines when i see these people that i trust and bond with am i just low on endorphines hi p  i am not a doctor  however i would classify you as mildly to moderately depressed and possibly slightly anxious are you see a therapist  do you have the means to see a therapist  if so they can be a great help your bms are normal  your heart rate is fine  you should however brush after every meal just to save your teeth if nothing else cant sleep  could be either or you seem to be concerned about your bms  dont be they are fine have you talked with a doctor  here is my advice  carry on and see if your condition get worst  you are not in a trauma state now  i can tell you that also it is normal of bowel consistency to be a bit off  and your heart can withstand beating 200 bpm for one week straight  and you would feel no pain  you would notice your heart racing  however it would not cause any permeant damage to your heart  it would feel strange yes  but painful no it would scare the pop out of you and most people  but in the end your would be just fine i think something happened in your live recently that is causing mild distress and that is leading to your symptoms my suggestion  see your doctor or stop by a minute clinic  get the word from them if you are still a bit off seek out a therapist if you can or just talk with a friend or close family member of course we are here to help as well  so glad you stopped by lighten your load  you are fine  but just get checked out  take care  keyplayer when you say you are very anxious about something do other people act like youre being ridiculous i was told by someone today to just pick up the phone and make a call instead of panicking kind of hurt having my anxiety minimized like that my mom tells me im being ridiculous when i get anxious but usually i am and i often worry for nothing things usually work out for me the way they are supposed to i almost died when i was 45 i was choking on a piece of hard butterscotch candy instead of running to my mom i ran to the living room i remember lying on the couch and i was just about to close my eyes when something told me to go get help so i ran to my mom who did the heimelic sp and got it out that was 20 years ago i didnt realize until a year or two ago that i was about to die i know i should let it go but it still scares me how should i get over this sorry if i scared anyone people make fun of my possibly anxietyrelated health issues they tell me im just a hypochondriac but i really do feel physically very sick which causes me to be afraid to do things like have a drink or even just go out because im scared i will make the symptoms worse or just be very bad company because i feel too bad to be fully present one time my sister got mad at me about something so she started mocking me walking around being like oh i feel soooo sick that was 5 years ago and it still hurts so bad thinking about it i didnt choose any of this im crying writing this its so awful i wish i knew how to make it stop i know people dont understand it especially because it is intermittent i really mean it when im so anxious i cant shop and need help people dont understand the feeling and cannot relate you cant expect everyone to understand exactly what having anxiety is like for you they likely didnt see it as minimizing your anxiety they likely do not even know what a comment like that could do to someone with anxiety but thats the thing you do what you will with that comment once its done said and passed you found the comment to be insensitive of the difficulty you were having but you dont have to see it that way or think that far into it but anxiety can definitely make one more prone to pick at such a moment ive personally come to accept when i end up looking foolish or ridiculous to others because i know they do not live in my realm of conciousness so their reasoning can not and will not factor in correctly what they do not know or understand about the core of who i am just like my perspective of them will be flawed as well because i am unable to factor in what i dont know about them or what i do not deeply understand in regard to the things i do know about them i can only assume the true depth of what someone else is going through because of that persons experiences they likely assumed the phone call was no big deal and they expressed that if they ever lived in your shoes for a day they probably wouldnt have said that i wouldnt want to live in a word where everyone tip toed around in every conversation in fear of saying something that supports their own thoughts feelings and experiences but conflicts and upsets someone else because of their own life past feelings etc however if that person wasnt trying to be helpful and encouraging about it when telling you to make the call than they dont really have a right to tell you what to do no matter someones perspective being rude and bossy about it isnt the right way to go in general i tend to suffer alone because i dont want anyone trying to guide me out of my panic attack whenever they do i perceive just a hint of condescension from them which i translate to youre being ridiculous i still remember a breaking point from childhood i was 12 suffering from extreme anxiety sobbing because i couldnt understand this impending feeling of doom my mother otherwise a nice gentle person snapped and yelled at me stop being a baby that broke something in me and i stopped asking for help and comfort from others then and there bjornensomething similar happened to me that is awful people just dont understand how painful it is and made worse by no one understanding i really needed comfort in that moment like never before it was an incredibly unbearable to feel so alone i honestly think it is very rude for a person to make such an insensitive statement when they know you have anxiety they know exactly what they are saying there are no excuses for just being flat out rude ive had this before too and its like how would they feel if they were the ones with the anxiety and someone made a nasty comment i feel i am always explaining the justification for my anxiety sometimes all i want is some validation i realise with some angst that i do this here too my husband often expresses exasperation with me too i dont blame him it cant be easy living with such a worrier my mother understands she has anxiety too i either inherited or learned it i have a few other friends who have experienced it and understand i do think its to do with personal experience so i went to los angeles this summer to visit my sister we had an amazing time she introduced me to weed and we got high togther many times one day we went and bought a 300 mg edible and i ate the whole edible me and my sister knew that these were the good times and that we would remember these good moments i was already a nostalgic person and i would cry sometimes and hug my sister so the night i ate th he edible i was already high but i wanted to get higher we went to chick fil a too and we ate i laid down in bed and i out of nowhere started to cry then after that i threw up and i became extremly confused not being able to understand anything i started saying im sorry god and my sister was telling me that im in la and i just took an edible i then just laid down and fell asleep next morning i felt weird like nothing was real no anxiety just a weird feeling we went to disneyland that day and i just felt like nothing was real it went away tho i came back to north carolina after my one month vacay at la i cried because i love my sister and it was a great vacation my sister sent me a weed vape pen because i just thought it would be nice to smoke some weed i smoked it a few times until one day i panicked for no reason but it wasnt as intense as the one in la so i brushed that off and decided to not smoke weed anymore i felt derealized again too but it went away i then said to myself okay im just gonna take one puff of my weed pen i got high but deep down i was anxious that i might get another panic attack so all that went away and i just brushed it off me and my sister listened to the jay z 444 album during my la vacation i decided to listen to it again i listened to a song and i started to panic for no reason and i knew i was panicking for no reason this happened probably 3 weeks or a month ago ever since then ive had anxiety for no reason i would have weird feelings in certain lighting mostly fluorescent lighting i started to worry that i might be going crazy aswell sometimes i look at myself and sometimes im just like wow thats me and recently like 2 days ago i started to worry and think i started to think about how i go to school everyday and how its like a loop i started to worry and i hate it because ive never thought like this before and i hate thinking like this i would at times feel better during these past 3 weeks but then it would come back its so annoying the day i listened to the jay z album i also started to think a lot about faces and how they have 2 eyes and stupid  like that that went away though i fear sometimes when i fee better if he anxiety will come back i hate this guys i just want to feel better i wish i never smoked that ing weed i wish i never smoked that stupid useless weed please guys i isnt want to feel better ive noticed that all this anxiety is stupid as  and that my life is great i have the bestest of friends who have been helping me out i cry sometimes aswell i cry because i love my family and friends and i dont want to lose them by going insane i want hope guys please please guys i dont know what to do i want to go to a psychologist aswell but i just want hope rn because i feel like ill never be myself again all this anxiety and all these thoughts are annoying it worries me when i think that this anxiety will never go away i regret smoking weed i never needed that  please guys i want hope ive never felt like this before will anybody help me all i want is hope i wish i never smoked weed and i dont want this anxiety and irrational way of thinking to stay i want to be better please what do i do try to relax breathe be easy on yourself the weed will leave your system and you will be ok i promise if it is the weed causing this it wont stay in your system for ever try to use distractions funny videos things that interest you cute guys or girls documentaries about your hobbies activities with friends that you love take your mind off of it its going to pass if its the weed is it the first time you smoked before are there stressors going on in your life right now things happening that are worrying you or bad things happening to you are you stressed or freaked out about having to leave your sister its going to be ok i promise just try to relax breathe deep and slow keep talking here i will talk to you i think you are going to be ok i have heard of that drug triggering psychosis and i have had innocuous drugs do it to me go see the doctor that is good advice i dont want to go crazy though guys thats my biggest fear and no i havent smoked in a month i guess when i listened to the jay z album i remembered la and remembered the panic attack i had there and i panicked i knew very well i was panicking for no reason so i immediately laid down and calmed myself ever since that which was 3 weeks ago my anxiety goes and comes i get a little anxious in certain lighting i dont know if i have a little bit of ptsd since it was the first panic attack ive had and i was high during it i dont want to go crazy guys thats my biggest fear because if i lose my mind i lose my friends and family and i love them so much i think it would help you to see a doctor to reassure you that you will be ok your anxiety seems to be centered around loosing your mind if you did in fact loose your mind as in psychosis there is successful treatment for that it does not mean you would loose your family and friends hi x and welcome to psych central i agree with the rest of the folks see your doc and tell what happened i dont think youll go crazy but weed doesnt sound like its for you hi xxarauz  i remember back in the day  we used to get some 1hitwonder and go sailing  but sometimes it would be a bad deal  and psychosis would hit  but if i just took it easy it would wear off i have no idea what it is like today  i have had people tell me that todays stuff  is like the very best gold back in the the day it all clears  bad trips  it all clears in a few days just drink plenty of water and fruit juice and u will be a ok i mean it wasntt tystick right  i dont even think you can get that anymore ok what is tystick  weed soaked in opium  that will mess u up ing time  kind of the same as chasing the dragon  not a good idea be safe  i herd about the gummies  i am not sure i would try then or not  even amazon sells then  ok  take care be well keyplayer im sorry you had and are having a tough time its good youre seeing a psychiatrist have you considered a therapist to process some of the things you are and are not feeling i agree that those 2 things might put you back on the path to feeling better sending big hugs i had a similar experience when i used to smoke weed it did some wild things to me i cant smoke it at all sometimes i have a good experience but mostly im paranoid anxious and it lasts for a long time afterward im super sensitive to all things whether its prescription drugs weed harder drugs what have you all i can say is id maybe consider staying away from the weed it might not be worth it if theres a chance it could aggravate what you are experiencing its also true what you said that it couldve triggered something to do with your ptsd anything is possible if it helps though i dont think you are going crazy im still here many years later and i still live anxiety and i have learned how to recognize it and that it doesnt mean im going crazy and if you need help ask for it dont be afraid to do whatever you need to do to keep yourself safe hi s  thanks  yes even with weed sometimes you never know what ur smoken  token  i have not done any illegal drugs for a long  time  and dont plan to start either  take care kp ive gone to the psychologist and she said im not going crazy im gonna do emdr therapy soon too i still worry about my mental health all i want is to feel better i regret smoking weed i hope i can move on thats all i want i know somethings wrong with me and i hope i can move on maybe i need to go back to visit my sister again but without using ing drugs i just want to feel like i did before smoking weed i know i keep saying that but its truly all i want what happened was that i just got too high and had a panic attack i had a memory flashback of the day after my panic attack when we went to disneyland when i listened to jay z im sorry this happened to you and hope it resolves itself its good youre getting help for it best wishes that did scare mei have had fears about choking to death and even developed a swallowing disorder but it is under control now with paxil but still i dont eat hard chewy things do you have that problem the only i can think is for you to go to therapy and talk it out sorry no i dont have a swallowing disorder ive had dreams about choking but it was only once or twice i dont eat hard butterscotch candy anymore i like the chewy ones though especially the ones with green apple in the middle so i started playing guitar for this church group there are other americans here yes but 25 of the people here arepastors other musicians here are from outside of the us they are from kenya now dont get me wrong they are all very nice but that part scares me i dont know if they travel outside the us ofteni am terrified of getting ebola and i heard people who travel outside of the us can get it i hope this doesnt sound messed up but my anxiety is high everytime i have to play at this church and hang around them for free of catching a diseaseebola since they are originally from outside the us is this normal to have anxiety from this i have always had social anxiety since childhood very severe had selective mutism in my 20s i had panic attacks and anxiety so bad i got to point i felt like i was going to die around the clock i have been on and off sertraline since then and now in my 40s i have been taking sertraline for 10 years at about 100mg the last 2 years i have been breaking end off so i probably get about 8090mg three months ago i decided i had had enough and wanted to try and go off of them i felt the withdrawal so i stayed at 50mg so for at least two months i have been taking 50mg and have been perfectly fine then last week i started feeling crazy i felt like i had to get out of my skin and was crying and didnt know what to do it started because i was having trouble sleeping because of a sore leg if i was inside the house i felt the need to be outside i couldnt stand the feel of tight pants around my ankles everything bothered me if my nose was blocked i had to get out of bad and keep walking around to clear it i also could not even look at a computer screen or my phone because it drove me crazy and it was too much to take i even had to leave house at 2 am to drive around with my windows open going who knows where i felt like i wanted to die i now know why people kill themselves and why people are addicted to drugs a few days later i asked to have a blood test wasnt sure if it was menopause or what and i found out my iron level was low hemoglobin 102 i have been low before but never felt this crazy low iron can cause anxiety and depression and i am already prone to it so now i know why i felt crazy i felt as if i was having a breakdown randomly crying at work etc i have been trying to take my iron pills now but sometimes forget and i know it is still low is feeling like i do a phobia or anxiety even right now i feel like crying and want to be let out of the house i live with other people right now and feel like i cant be near them i feel they are causing me to feel like this i feel like i always need to be doing something somewhere other than so called home i have been using so much gas on my car because i feel the need to keep getting away i was told by dr to go back up to the 100mg sertraline so i did for a few days i got better now im back to 50mg i am writing this now and i dont feel good i feel like i will not be able to sleep with my leg pain and i feel like i am going stir crazy has anyone experienced this feeling of having to get out of where you are almost like a claustrophobic feeling help i was on sertraline years ago and withdrew and told myself i would never take again withdrawal is sooo bad i dont want to take it because i feel it makes me make bad decisions and makes me stay in situations i shouldnt be in it makes you take things you should not take i have issues in my life that i just put up with and should not put up with i had a somewhat abusive husband that i stayed with until i withdrew off sertraline years ago my life has been stuck in the same position for ten years i need to move on and the drugs make you just sit there and take it i have also read all about the horror stories of withdrawal and have lived through withdrawal before tonight i took 100mg because of how i am feeling but when my iron level goes back up i will try to withdraw again i stopped for sex drive reasons also the numbness does go away somewhat after years of taking it it also makes you tired and it may be why i eat so much also i am convinced these drugs are poison for your brain yes some people do need it i was a huge huge huge caffeine drinker drinking lots of tea and soda and suddenly one day i couldnt drink it anymore i thought it was so weird i started taking paxil and took one little and i mean one sip of drpepper my heart felt weird but i thought that was weird i took my paxil last night why would caffeine all of sudden give me anxiety suddenly i didnt start paxil until last wednesday and i started having caffeine sensitivity maybe a month ago sorry you are feeling so awful i just wanted to say as i read your post that it reminded me of trying to get off of effexoryou are quite right when you say withdrawal is nasty with these meds i did it correctlywith doctors approval slow withdrawal over time and yet it apparently wasnt slow enough because i was absolutely miserable for example id normally have the radio or tv on in the morning while getting ready for work but suddenly even music was too much being around people set me right on edge couldnt concentrate jittery etc i thought i was going crazy almost everything was just too much stimuli and so i called the psychiatrist and got it adjusted even more slowly it took quite awhile to get off it  and like you i vowed never again but that was years ago and guess what i am on now yup you guessed it  effexor i absolutely dread the withdrawal but it is coming because i am not feeling its doing much for me this time and i am doing okay these days i am not a doctor and as you said you have low iron so maybe it is solely that but you might want to ask your doctor if medication withdrawal could be contributing to any of these symptoms wowi understand i hope you have a better transition this time going from 100 to 50 mg if 50 mg doesnt work for you could you try another medication hugs today i am worrying and getting anxious more so than in a long time no triggers i am immediately aware of just lots happening no one to really talk to went to the docs today but screwed up speaking to him so he probably thinks i am lying now or just being silly should have written down what i wanted to say then i wouldnt forget things and get confused lack of sleep probably not helping scared i cant cope scared i wont cope and i will lose everything why is it coming back i thought i was over it thought i had beat it all the anxiety the depression the self harm but slowly it creeps back in taking up a familiar place in my mind questioning every thought action conversation sorry i needed to put it down try to reverse it get more sleep if you can and remember what helped you in the past i hope it all moves out there is no vacancy in that familiar place in your mind for them yep having a tbi can do that my brother has tbi and he imagines entire scenarios he is in disability and lives with my other brother he asked my mother the other day do you remember last week when i took you with me and bought that red car then i took you riding around in it we explained no mike that didnt happen you cant drive either its just your brain injury he just shrugged and said oh he was ok with it thank god it doesnt seem to bother him when he finds out that he imagined something i suppose a migraine aura would not explain it  you would know if you were having one of those it happens know that no good streak lasts forever but neither does a bad one you dont beat it forever at least not negativity but perhaps perhaps you can learn to simply be at peace with it how do you do that take a step back see the bigger picture and know that it isnt always that bad when youre so anxious and depressed everything seems so bleak these are just thoughts that feed on your negativity when youre feeling positive positive thoughts will occur im saying this to remind myself too i know it isnt always easy sometimes the  just doesnt seem fair i know you try so hard but still and that counts for everybody everybody just tries their very best according to what they know and belief still there is so much suffering in the world it seems so demotivating but theres hope i look at mentors and gurus who seem happy or even blissful they show me that there is still light they show me certain waypoints along the path the path itself they can not show thats for me to figure out but they show a possibility i also look at my own experience certainly ive had moments of happiness or relative happiness but i dont look at that so much its good to remind yourself that this too will change that life moves in cycles but to me that is not vital ive given up on trying to be happy although my behaviour certainly doesnt always reflect that statement no my goal in this life is to become peaceful what is peace that happiness is not peace is ease distance being peaceful you are not so concerned with your highs and lows but you watch it as if you have in fact nothing to do with these highs and lows altogether as if youre not part of it can you remember moments like that you were unhappy but you just didnt really care about it you looked at it but it didnt feel as if it were you those moments i desire so much more than ordinary happiness because i know happiness is so fleeting but peace perhaps one day it would not be fleeting anymore i want to experience that but i want you and everybody to experience that too i dont know if that helps you its a perspective but you dont have to accept it if you dont want you said you had nobody to talk to if you want you can talk with me im trying to be a more openhearted person id like to help im not online here too often nor do i check the inbox here often so if you want just contact me on my phone number 31627544818 not sure if posting phone numbers is against forum rules or not but ill leave it here for now i dont mind dont be shy to contact me id like to be of service for that matter it is okay for anyone reading this to contact me if they want to talk ill try my best to listen more than to put out theories unless you ask of course i can understand this kind of anxiety one time at a business conference a man sneezed directly into my right eye i worried for months the probability of getting ebola is very very low and like another poster said it comes from being in contact with infected body fluids i think you are ok i apologize in advance if this post is too long  but please bear with me  thank you for taking the time to read back in june of this year i seemed to experience some sort of breakdown i was so paralyzed in stress and anxiety that i completely couldnt function at work or home i ended up quitting my job and had to rest at home during this time i also had this feeling that i could lash out at anyone  like my manager but mostly my parents who i live with i felt boiling anger and resentment which ill explain more below to give some context  i am 24 years old and have lived at home since graduating college 2 years ago ive overall had a happy upbringing but did feel a bit directionless and depressed during college some things happened that affected me i felt pretty low and depressed about moving back home upon graduating but didnt know what else to do i ended up taking a job in my hometown which was a good opportunity even though i dont feel like i fit in my town and always wanted to be in the city i dont really have many friends around here in terms of my parents theyre immigrants from europe and have always put some pressure on my sister and me to succeed in life so ive never told them about my struggles with depression  fast forward to june this year i had this breakdown and continue to be at home as i mentioned above i felt an intense feeling of resentment and anger directed mostly towards my parents i felt like i was sick of everyone in my life and tired of pretending i was ok and happy i always felt this pressure to be the good child in my parents eyes i specifically felt resentment towards my mom for the emotional invalidation ive gotten from her over the years to go along with these feelings i felt crippling anxiety and had intense panic attacks and this urge to escape and like i was going to absolutely lose it i kept telling myself just burst out and express your painanger stop holding back from your parents but the anxiety was so bad i couldnt do it no matter how much i tried it felt like i was going to go out of control which scared me  over the following months since then i feel pretty numbed out depressed i guess like i feel very isolated from the world and nothing interests me at all im seeing a psychiatrist so hopefully that will help my concerns looking back on all this is why do i feel numb now and is it because of those intense feelings i sensed how do i get back to feeling like myself and normal and a part of the world sometimes i feel like im on the verge of breaking down emotionally or having a meltdown like theres something deep within me that needs to come out or fall apart  has anyone ever experienced this or what do you make of it dear jenna 61997  im so sorry you are going through this i completely understand when you say you cant express yourself or be your true self with your parents i was never able to eitheri always felt like i needed to pretend to be who they wanted me to beand still do im now 42 i never really speak my mind with my family i dont have a lot of experience in this but what i can tell you from my own experience is that sometime we feel numb because it is easierbetter than feeling so much pain and suffering it is a defense mechanism and its normal youre protecting yourself right now from additional pain so that you can get through this try not to stress over it your body and mind just need a break  anxiety can be exhausting both mentally and physically i slept almost all day for 12 weeks after starting anxiety meds  my anxiety had been so high for so long that i was completely exhausted from it im glad you are seeing a psychiatrist and i hope that you have or will talk to them about how you are feeling ive been doing therapy for 6 months and it has helped a lot as well as some anxiety meds  which have made a huge difference please dont be afraid to open up to your doc and ask for help  it is hard and i had to tell my doc things i had never told anyone before and it was scary but its worth it  they really do want to help you sometimes just being able to tell someone how you feel can give you some relief even if its not your parents who you wish you could tell sometimes our parents dont have the skills to teach us all of the things we need to know once were grownups perhaps theyre emotionally shutdown themselves or dont know how to talk about difficult things maybe no one did that for them but right now you need to take care of yourself and if youre not comfortable talking to them please talk to your doctor thank you so much for taking the time to read my long message and also for providing genuine feedback it really means a lot and puts things in perspective part of me is frustrated that i never expressed my emotions but perhaps in time i will thanks again and i hope you feel better too 3 i dont know if this is mental health or not but i need to see if anyone else experiences this say youre looking at the sidewalk corner of an intersection where you know theres always been a 4way stop you know there should be a stop sign there i mean youve seen everyday when youre coming home but theres no stop sign nor is there any sign there has ever been one still it should be there so you stare at this spot determined to see the pole and the red sign attached but no dice its not there you blink change your line of sight but its still missing then your friend next to you asks whats going on and you look at them to ask where is the stop sign you look back pointing at the location and theres the sign there just like always i wanted to chalk this up to some sort of brain fart but it was so intense this isnt the only time this has happened to me and it happens with almost any object in fact its fairly common its even happened with an entire building once like theres the plot of land but the building has been replaced with a small grass field when i do this its always on one of my bad days which means a laundry list of symptoms from my disorders are at the top of their game so basically when my stress is through the roof can anyone else relate or have any idea what this is i know ill bring it up with him today i just was looking to see if anyone else understood it too i forgot the name for it but apparently its a condition caused by traumatic brain injury which makes sense so i guess this isnt technically a mh condition i had a massive pa at work and was too bad to stay afterwards now im dreading going back monday i just keep playing scenarios in my head over and over about what is going to be said it was in front of my manager boss and office staff i have been put on valium to help me get through but im so sick to my stomach i have recently been diagnosed with a slew of things the one i struggle with the most is anxiety coupled with ptsd i had some really bad things happen recently and my therapist suggested that if it gets worse to go to the er not because im suicidal im not but because im not fuctioning at all im not on meds yet bc im waiting for my appointment so im curious when you guys think its best to go get help and maybe get started on meds quicker when is your appointment you need the meds sooner rather then later i feel for you i have anxiety and depression and would much rather deal with the depression if it gets too bad and you do go to the hospital i doubt they would put you ip since youre not suicidal theyll probably give you a sedative like valium and maybe a prescription for some more im sorry you are struggling sending big hugs i once was so anxious i found a walk in psyche type clinic same day and told counselor i need something to calm me short term they gave me ativan it worked but i am scared of drugs but only took it on extremely bad days rarely 2 days in a row i am afraid of addiction personally but it helps to know it is there in case things are really bad i forgot how i found it but i would suggest calling any psyche place and ask them if there is any such thing in your town ask for a same day clinic just be honest with them i consistently have higher anxiety on monday and even sunday night it is most likely because i have to work on monday and all the stresses and anticipation hits me i feel like i go through this cycle almost every week my anxiety is high on monday and i spend the rest of the days bringing it down to a level i can more easily cope with is there a way to break this pattern other than quitting my job of course ive been putting off getting a therapist for a long time because i lost my job and cant afford it i decided a few days ago just to go and put it on credit cards for the time being because my anxiety has gotten really bad and i just have no idea what else to do anymore every waking minute feels like pure torture and i have the thought that i want to just die many times per day so anyway i started trying to call up therapists in my insurance network and it seems like no one ever answers their phone i mean it makes sense that they would often be away from their phones if theyre in sessions with clients but how in the heck does anyone ever manage to schedule an appointment with a therapist if they never answer their phones  of course the few that do answer are completely booked for the rest of the year this is stressing me out and making my anxiety even worse i have no friends and no supportive family members to turn to for support either i feel like i have no options and nowhere to go i dont have any advice right off so hopefully others will something tells me you are not alone in this just wanted to show my support and send big hugs i was taking some mucinex so that may of increased my heart rate which is quite possible i paxil mentions serotonin syndrome when you drink caffeine which is quite rare but if i drink a bottle of pop or have one cup of coffee will it hurt me id ask my psychiatrist but knowing my psychiatrist id be shot down since my psychiatrist tells me sugar is bad which i guess i kinda agree on some levels sorry you are having a hard time finding help i have a few ideas that might work have you ever checked out the psychology today website they have a therapist finder section that lists the therapists their credentials treatment orientation etc in each citystate often they have a photo with the listing and they also indicate whether a sliding scale fee is available its very well done in my opinion the other possible option is online therapy via email computer phone etc i was pleasantly surprised at how helpful my experience was check out presto experts website or better counseling and i am sure there are other reputable sites also just thought of this and you may have already tried it but many cities have mental health clinics that offer low cost therapy groups etc the big drawback with this one is they often have a waiting list but if you tell them its rather urgent perhaps they can get you in sooner rather than later good luck i get this too i cant seem to cure the lowlevel dread i feel but if i have a particularly hard sunday i will identify and write down everything about the next dayweek that is worrying me i will try to come up with an action plan for everything im worried about sometimes this is enough to reduce the dread back to manageable levels sometimes its not though im sorry youre having such a tough time i can relate have you called every provider in your network and left a message then followed up i know its frustrating my therapist retired and it was difficult finding another therapist i had to be persistent it was difficult enough to find somebody in network that i considered doctor on demand i hope you find somebody in network soon the above poster has some excellent ideas if you cant sending big hugs so sorry you are having a hard time finding someone it is really hard it took 3 months for me to get in for my first appointment and the day of that appt the doctor was out sick and i had to reschedule for a month later 4 months it took to get in its really tough waiting for so long when you feel like you need help now hope you can find someone i havent been diagnosed for sure as to whether its anxiety or not but assuming it is how do you treat it lemon water with or without a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar ginger root sliced or in capsule cinnamon green tea i drinktake all these on a daily basis i usually have a lot of bloating from ibs and the pill but these methods have kept me fitting in my jeans lol hope i helped ive tried to explain this to many people but all fail to come to a conclusion on why it is i feel the way i do when i have my anxiety attacks so i question whether or not anyone shares this experience or if it is extremely irregular when i have my anxiety attacks which are fairly common id say i have multiple a month they build up for days and days then i finally outburst when i express them outwardly i become completely detached from everything and seems as if i lose all control over my body emotions brain etc but i also simultaneously feel the most control ive ever experienced i feel like i have nothing to worry about in the world it starts with anger i commonly flip my bed over completely slam my fists into my walldoorfloor until they bloody then i break down and cry for a very short period then i have what as i describe as an addiction i look forward to this part of my attacks i have intense hysteria and laugh uncontrollably for a while and i clean up everything i just did tidy everything up then have a hot shower and im completely fine ive never spoken to anyone with anxiety as well so i dont know if this is normal feedback would be appreciated im fairly concerned no i havent im waiting until im legally an adult my parents and i share the fear of going to see a professional about mental health because my little brother was diagnosed with bipolar personality disorder and they had him on lithium and turned him into a zombie im not a dr but that sounds like bipolar disorder rather than anxiety i strongly suggest you see a dr and start your healing process xx ive become increasingly isolated over the years and i barely talk to people anymore i live with my mother and my cousin but we dont have a good relationship so i dont talk to them much either yesterday an acquaintance that i hadnt spoken with in a few months texted me so i started getting anxious and overthinking things to a ridiculous extreme like i cant think of a thing to say i dont have anything interesting to say i dont want to say something weird or dumb or annoying she knows vaguely of some of my issues so she probably pities me i doubt shes texting me because she likes me as a person im not likeable im not even a very nice person and then it always takes me way too long to respond a text and this is just with texting or talking online in person i can barely look at someones face i feel lonely most of the time and i wish i had someone to talk to but when the opportunity presents i just wanna go hide somewhere ive been meaning to go to a therapist ive searched in my area and ive found one that i want to go see but i havent called yet i dont even know what to say tbh like what is someone even supposed to say in this situation in the meantime if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this type of issue id appreciate it yes call the therapist so you can start getting the help and support you need for your social anxiety also dont beat yourself up you are being too harsh with yourself kindness will get you much further and youll feel better i empathize i have social anxiety and isolate as well good luck sending big hugs one sip seems like such a small amount that is weird if you stopped caffeine for a long period of time and then started back you could feel the effects more strongly because your body is not used to it anymore also i know certain medicines can intensify it and some overthecounter drugs contain it such as headache cold and allergy medicines i have sensitivity to caffeine but can drink a small amount if i have too much i get jittery and restless ive started experiencing intense anxiety with a woman in work she is nice but can be intimidating and has been quite harsh with me before which i think has made me feel anxious around her at the end of the day in work we have to read out a handover of the days events and with everyone else its fine but with her when i start reading i go red and my voice trembles and i just cant do it ive started saying im sorry im so tired i cant read this which is a terrible excuse and will not keep working i will be doing a handover with her in a few days and im already dreading it almost going as far as to think i will need to get off work early to avoid it the whole thing takes less than 5 minutes and when i talk to her im absolutely fine its just reading out this handover i dont know what to do it feels impossible to overcome right now maybe you try to talk to her about this issue in private i had a boss who intimidated me and could get quite harsh when i screwed up i actually brought it up to him in a performance review so we were alone i ended up crying and felt really embarrassed but i got it out in the open he was understanding about it and after that he didnt criticize me in front of others he still got on me when i screwed up but he did it in private i was grateful for that and appreciated the tips on how to improve my performance this is the reason well and my bp that i cannot work because of my ptsd i have an intense fear of women and if theyre of authority even worse ive gotten panic attacks at every job because of this sometimes id spend 30 min in the bathroom having a panic attack or id just be told to go home one asshole boss said dont come back until you get on xanax those exact words and he meant it i totally get how you feel but does it maybe come from a deeper issue i had a step monster that ruined my life growing up and now i cant trust or feel comfortable around women i agree with shazerac if you can talk to her privately do so sending big hugs im sorry this happened to you i agree with travelinglady act as if nothing happened you may be uncomfortable at first but it will pass sending big hugs hugs oh that must be scary i wouldnt bring up unless they ask if they do just tell them youve gone to the doctor and are looking into it im so afraid great im so glad they were so understanding its not easy to deal with i want through the same thing however my supervisor wasnt as understanding i caught a bunch of stuff over it so much for a understandind bunch of coworkers i no longer work there i know just what you mean last week i picked up a prescription which cost me equivalent of 2wks groceries i have always gotten my medication free because of my benefits so this was a big shock everyone says i should have refused it but i am not the type for confrontation so i reluctantly paid for it now i am kicking myself for taking it i am sure my doctor could have represcribed some alternative hello im not sure if anyones ever experienced this but for some time now ive been experiencing hyperawareness of life particularly in the emotional sense of things relations with other people and the fluidity of life its hard to explain but for example if im in a fight with someone in my head i become aware of each moment and feeling in the process like i anticipate what is going to happen next or what im going to be feeling next emotionally this doesnt allow me to experience my feelingsthe moment smoothly because its like this hijacking mechanism that tells me oh youre going to be feeling this next its like overanalyzing my and others progression of feelings does anyone know what im talking about this may be coming from feeling extremely jaded ive been depressed for a long time now and i really feel hopeless and at the end of my rope like nothing is going to help its really hard for me to get my emotions and pain out  i almost feel crazy and like im making this all up because of how empty i feel i dont remember what normal life feels like hello welcome to pc ive never experienced this but i hear what youre saying personally i tend towards hypervigilance in many social situations which is always thinking ahead and being extremely wary of what might go wrong next and trying to think of various outcomes and responses before they happen so i overanalyze things and people this sounds like it might be similar yes its very tiring and unhelpful i doubt youre jaded or just making it up it sounds like you might not only be anxious but anxious about being anxious and your mind is racing ahead in a futile effort to cut it off  by worrying about it all maybe you relate to that this is supposedly common for people with certain forms of anxiety you say youve been depressed for some time now im sorry to hear youre struggling so much have you sought out any help yet maybe someone else here can share some more relevant experiences welcome to pc and take care i am currently have anxiety about getting anxiety i fear that by becoming anxious i will ruin a special moment i used to drink a lot of caffeine and it never bothered me until i switched to water for awhile once i went back to caffeinemajor anxiety i strictly limit caffeine now i would just keep an eye on it and be cognizant of what causes what hi cepheidvariable this sounds very accurate actually something a previous counsellor mentioned to me having anxiety about anxiety it sometimes feels like an uncontrollable pattern but im glad someone else can relate thank you for your help and advice i actually sometimes get anxiety when i do not have enough caffeine i probably drink too many coffees so it is pretty wierd hope u feel better i recently paid what i think was too much for a repair at the time i had to get the repair done and i didnt want to wait to find someone else i dont know if what i paid was normal for the job but i continue to feel anxiety and regret around the loss of money even a week after i paid i probably should have waited and found someone that did charge so much putting it behind me is difficult i cant do anything about it now so i am not sure why i still have anxiety around it im new to this support site i remember being part of one when i was pregnant with my daughter and it really seemed to help mostly because i was the one offering my help and doing what i could to help other new moms today i find myself in a group and its because i need help i have struggled with obsessive thoughts and anxiety since i was 10 years old now im 36 and my world seems to be spiraling out of control i quit my job and moved to a new city with my daughter and boyfriend my boyfriend started a new business that i am helping him to grow starting a new business is scary my daughter was diagnosed with autism about 8 years ago and i work with other children who have been diagnosed with autism my life really seems great on paper but in my mind im destined to fail and i cant seem to do anything right i get chest pains nightly and i cry for no reason i cant sleep and i fidget constantly lately i fight with my boyfriend all of the time mostly because he moves things out of their designated place in the house ive begun to obsess over where things are placed and if theyre not then it sets me off on my own i decided to go to the doctor yesterday it didnt take them long to suggest a medication to go on and after 15 hours and some questionnaires later i was released back into the wild this is what brings me here today i have a prescription sitting in my nightstand and i am terrified to take it it promises me a world i havent known since i was a small child but i am so scared it will change me i dont know what to do im here because i hope somebody can help me work through this or share their experience taking a prescription for the first time causes a new wave of fear in me im lost and i feel more broken than i ever have felt hello first of all welcome to pc i was scared of medication changing me too im not going to tell you to just jump in and everything will be roses but i will tell you my experience you probably know this already but everyone responds differently to different medications so dont expect any one outcome based on what others say still there are some things that are more common than others is your prescription an antidepressant i started with one a few years ago and it had some unpleasant but manageable side effects still it didnt do a whole lot for me and i stopped after a few months i started up a second round with a different type two years later and it seems to be the right one for me im on my fourth month of this new med has it changed me a little but not in a bad way i dont think im not an emotional zombie which was a fear of mine has it given me my life back as some claim these medications do yes and no i can tell you that i am not magically cured and i am not out of the woods with depression and anxiety butthese things have lessened noticeably and when i do have good days they are usually better than ive known in a long time so for the time being i am glad i took the plunge im glad i came back and tried again after the first round didnt do anything for me take this experience with a grain of salt as you wrestle with your decision though i just wanted to offer one perspective there are others on here who might give more caution than me and others still who will be much more insistent on you taking them now this instant sorry for the wall of text i wish you luck in managing your anxiety hello welcome to pc im sorry youre struggling with whether or not you should take the medication it could really help you just wanted to lend my support and wish you a smooth transition if you decide to go with taking it sending big hugs to give you a brief history i had a stroke about six months ago and although im recovering have all of my mental faculties and speech hasnt been affected i still have weakness in my left leg which causes me to limp which im going to physical therapy for and it seems to be getting a little better slowly im counting my blessings that my stroke wasnt worse about 2 months ago i would start getting these anxiety atacks that came out of nowhere what i mean i wasnt thinking about anything specific or worried about anything specific it affects me physically as sometimes i cantt sleep when im having one of these episodes ive been doing some guided meditations and exercising which seems to help a little what ive been reading is that trying to push away the anxiety can make it worse and that i should just accept it its a really hard thing to do as i know how  i will feel after one of these anxiety attacks its like trying to not be anxious when you know you are getting sick because you know how bad you will fee anyone have any experience with this i get anxiety when im having physical problems having a stroke is a pretty major event in your life its a lot to cope with and the fear that it might happen again this could be what is causing your anxiety maybe you could try indentifying the source of your anxiety in meditation just a thought i struggle with a lot of freefloating anxiety not related to anything in particular i always have im almost 70 years old now and after so many years i think my body just simply doesnt know how to act any other way and as i get older it seems like my anxiety is getting gradually worse i also experience periodic bouts of paranoia i have done sitting meditation in the past but ive never found it to be particularly beneficial although i still do a bit of it i do a mindfulnessbased exercise routine that is a combination of yoga some physical therapy exercises i learned to strengthen my low back  some plain old calisthenics i also do some walking meditation particularly late at night when i cant sleep ill walk aroundaround our dark  quiet home focusing light attention on each foot as it touches the floor thoughts come  go i simply watch them  allow them to arise  fade at their own pace none of this is a cure by any means but it all helps two books that have been particularly beneficial to me have been jon kabatzinns book full catastrophe living and pema chdrns book start where you are a guide to compassionate living best wishes im sorry youre experiencing this im glad you came through the stroke okay can you ask your doctor if this free floating anxiety is a result of the stroke and if he has anything he can suggest sending big hugs hi yzen  man  i hate it when that happens  i hear you i own a 14  a 12 year old honda civic ex  dead mint  with less than 60k  plus a 35 year old mobile home  i mean geez  i am always getting taken to the cleaners  i feel for yeh  really but the best thing to do  is try to but it behind you  sure it hard  real hard there have been times i would go food shopping and think did i over pay   i would stop on the side of the road and check my wallet to make sure  i could not even wait to get home so i know where you are coming from  it sux  but everything cost so much  i mean geez heres what i would do  grab a snack and chat  get your mind off of it  you really cant do anything about it anyway i hope u feel better and u r not alone  me  i am real clean  lol later kp thanks keyplayer that is good advice to get my mind off it and move on and stay clean lol i tend to let regrets and losses trigger my anxiety i have to remind myself that nothing really belongs to anyone forever and we can only move forward why let what i lost in the past bother me now i need to let go of it im sorry this happened to you and that you are feeling anxiety about it you cant go back and change it now but youve gained valuable knowledge for the future try to focus on moving forward and not spending time or energy on what you cant change sending big hugs i have felt i had made huge progress in overcoming my anxiety mainly social anxiety i went through therapy take anti depressantsanti anxiety medication and today it was put to the test and i failed miserably i was invited to a support group for abuse survivors and i felt lost and sick almost the entire 2 hours i didnt speak a word and i felt that i was about to burst into tears for the whole session i felt so prepared and ready for it that it shocked me at how horrible i felt throughout i just do not know how i can improve and feel okay socializing my goal was to go to college this year and after tonight i feel so horribly defeated and hopeless i feel i just wont be able to do this anymore i dont know what to do anymore i dont know what to say only that i am sorry and that i understand how you feel unfortunately remember how brave you were hoping this was just a minor set back in the process and you keep doing better today i went to the movies with my parents to watch jumanji i have already posted here about how my parents are overprotective and make me wear a crazy amount of winter clothes so i was wearing my giant parka with a winter coat under it and my snow pants and big winter boots when we got to the movies i took my coats off but kept my snow pants and boots on while waiting to go into the theater some kid goes to his mom why is she wearing snow pants shes not skiing when he said that literally like 15 people all turned and looked at me i could feel myself getting so red from the embarrassment then after the movie while we were still in the theater lobby my mom helped me get my coats back on in full view of everyone then just like i was a little kid she pulled the hoods up and wrapped me up in my scarf i could feel all the people staring at me probably wondering why i was wearing so much winter clothes this is why i just wanna stay home and not go out in public for a few months ive really struggled partially i think its been related to a visit to the dentist half a year ago which revealed quite suddenly that i have many problems and not nearly enough funds to solve them so ive been saving since then and trying to recover mentally and today i had enough courage for a consultation now im afraid that it was too soon because of the effect the interaction with the people has had on me although maybe there is no good time from the inability to formulate responses to speak clearly to sweating all the time not being able to follow what the other person is saying then fighting with myself about it on the way home plus the fear of pain and them clearly knowing that im feeling it whats worse i cant in good conscience treat myself to a sweet as a rewardcomfort i just hate myself not in life not in the disease what i have goes beyond labels i am writing here this time because i feel i need to share and i feel i need to hide i am embarassed of myself of my fear of my behaviours and my decisions if i ever had a true friend in my life i would turn their lifes in to a mess because that is what i am i can putt anyone off i push people away from me as i am i could write anywhere else but i feel embarassed about what people who had see my posts and already know a bit of my story will think i feel embarassed of who i am i can read criticism and disaproval in peoples words and faces all the time i cant trust anyone its beyond me and i feel alone people think i dont like them and that i am weird but if i explained this to them they would find me even more weird and i wouldnt be able to look at them again in shame there was this person that wanted to hang out with me just the two but i have to complicate every thing in my mind i wanted and i didnt because is always awful i made up a lot of scenarios in my mind for such a small simple thing because of my vague and sparse answears online messages he deduced i didnt want to go out that probably i was trying to avoid him whatever nothing is going to happen now and it makes me feel safe but at the same time i made such a fool of myself he is a nice person not threatening but even so i was stressed so he must think i dont like him as a person or that i am very weird or both and i am mad at me you have my sympathies i hate going to the dentist or doctor especially as i struggle to explain myself clearly and worry about being misunderstood whenever i go i try to proud of myself reminding myself that by taking care of myself or at least trying to that im doing a really good thing i know youre scared but you should stick with going back for another consultationtreatment you may have enough money to have some of your problems fixed there are online support forums for people with dental phobia they offer good advice to each other on what to expect and offer tips on how to cope maybe it would be useful to you please take care and good luck let us know how you get on also be proud of yourself for finding the courage to go back oh i forgot about this thread well since last time i got a root canal done and a filling at that time but also a filling just yesterday that sounds kind of crappy well hopefully my new sugarfree diet improves the situation i mean the situation is supposed to deteriorate with age but hopefully at a slower rate social anxiety doesnt particularly haunt me at that clinic well the last visit was kind of awkward but i dont let myself dwell on it nowadays by almost always listening to things on the headphones outside in particular hi mulan i can see you posted this months ago but just wanted to say i can relate to every word as if i was the one saying them thank you theres a certain comfort in knowing im not alone but as you know you still have to face each day andthe people oh dear i blew it with my last real life friend as well  its been a real learning curve a very very long learning curve thats still curving up and up and around  i cant see the end of it im not the full quid just feeling really empty today disillusioned but i know the hope will return once my emotions settle a bit more just want you to know youre not alone as well over the years ive become really compulsive about my teeth i go to the dentist every six months to have them cleaned  checked as a result theyre in pretty good shape now although i had a lot of problems many years ago as a young adult since my parents didnt take care of my teeth growing up but i still always dread going to the dentist i start ruminating over it about a week before every appointment im glad to hear youre getting your dental problems taken care

they emptied it  oasis said they were influenced by them and liked it and they copied it in their early work  which is why their chords were ace too  only freakos can hear genius chord manipulation and the use of it the rest of people just enjoy music and cant hear why didnt see this tom but interesting op and topic and seen that it is 5 pages on and dont have time read the situation  but mine would be this if choice pick the least noisiest if choice was flat 1 or 2 and flat 1 was much nicer but had party neighbours then flat 2 would win everytime even if colddamp and generally worse  ps hope it endedends well i hope to catch up with the thread when more time yes i know the complexities are far greater than a vs b tom  i was just summing up as people do these days   my neighbours now are noisy social tenants but when i lived in a council flat i had at least 2 bad neighbours  for noise so even though this is better than before its by no means my ideal   noisy fucking twat he got in about 20 mins ago and all ive heard is his drunken shouting as always what a fuckin moron  the only answer is everyone with their own detached space i would like to be 1 mile away from nearest neighbour to cover all angles oh aye castle with a moat  yes please    my bedroom is not part of the joined side of the house its a semi    it always miffs me why semidetached buildings put the rooms next to each other and the stair cases at the far side why not put all that in the middle probably cheaper to build   own island is deffo the best of the lot id love that as long as a boat to do some shopping  i cant see me living off the land  not straight away anyway      i probably couldnt live on floor 17 im not good with heights saying that if ever live in a flat again i would want a balcony to sit out on i hated living in flat with non as i found it quite claustrophobic yes my flat was only 4th floor so i only used the lift to move heavy things   i never used it at night when finishing work as thought if it got stuck id be terrified of stuck in there all night tom there are a lot of hindsight posts in last couple of days   believe me and probably everyone in here would back me up at some point we have experienced hindsight   im even thinking of changing my middle name to it    edit in last few posts youve been looking more at things some things we cant change and beat self up about and huge problems my advice given to me and i try and do it is try and split things up a bit and manage these things rather than the entire problem   try and stay positive tom    i do try that is nowt worse than loud music and on a monday too  this is why social housing doesnt work imo its not social at all ear plugs dont cut it for me my sensitivities can feel noise through vibration generally through my feet if on the ground when neighbour is banging around even with headphones on i can feel it hes drunken shouting now   i can cope with that its his guitar that does me and singing i cant drown it out   ive have a few shouting matches with him through the wall but its not how i want to live i tend to return the favour if they bang music out for x hours when it stops and sounds like theyve gone to bed get the speaker aimed at the floor above their bedroom and return the favour for same amount of time yes i tend to only react when my mind loses it  i tried to asked the housing authority to help and as i posted in here what happened when i anonymously reported it  i went downstairs next day and someone had smashed my car up   the ones downstairs i shouldnt have messed with they were trouble and i knew it  another time when i lost it with next door and went around and banged on the door and shouting that they didnt even open it to be fair when i watched the recording that i made during that i wouldnt have opened the door either  and i subsequently decided not to use that footage for evidence  not current neighbours the ones in the car smashed place  to avoid conflict now i try to just point out obviously that i can hear them in hope of shutting them up so if they play loud music i do the same when theirs goes off to show them that i can hear them it works sometimes my old defence for their actions if they didnt realise how thin the walls are was that i dont make a sound i always where my headphones and i dont have any doors to bang  however they know now that the walls are thin due to my actions  the problem with this tactic is that the loud music annoys me too i prefer my headphones for loud music  though this would not be the case if i lived in the middle of nowhere  i would put my music on as loud as i wanted to the forums if i ever get called for jury service i will pop down to a tshirt printers first and have some words printed on one to make absolutely sure i dont get picked  i cant post specifics aliwali as i would have to ban myself    hope it goes ok btw pleasure have a nosy round   its a bit quite in uk time here at night but there are lots of threads and support  m to the forum  i just think that whether or not its cheesy ridiculous media fest or promotional nonsense i like that it brings lots of business to small businesses small flowershop businesses restaurants taxis pubs etc and that is all extra work for people shame its fallen on a saturday though because other than flower shops they all benefit from this already so it just makes things busier when it would be better on a weekday hi     ive just googled it looks like short courses to me the stress one is already full though to the forums alice hi cheekyowl  to the forums to the forums hi welcome to the forums  have a nosy around the site   quoted wrong person doh are they yours or his meds he is taking to the forums tango i guess dealing with the abortion has had an effect   my way of dealing with anxiety is something that i wouldnt recommend i end up going in circles with order and control it works for me but is no long term answer and perhaps perpetuates my stuff   have a look at our ptsd area maybe something will click in there else hang in there with us its a bit quiet here at night uk time anxiety is something that many of us in here deal with i think looking at how people deal with it can often give different ideas as of course we all deal with things differently no like inner says above its for anyone in the world  for certain helps and that knowing what is available in a country helps sleep well and with peace all the best  no i dont think i would like a group interview either top bold great   bottom bold i shouldnt worry about that this is a tactic big companies use to find people initially to do shifts that no one else wants   it could still turn out well welcome back to the forums gamer  im not sure i can give any advice though everyone is different there was a good documentary about spiders the other day saying that though i probably wouldnt have  lasted the full hour and half if it wasnt for prof alice roberts hosting it   it was really interesting  perhaps good for arachnaphobes sp too yes this is what to do george listen to this advice of the posters   stopping some things suddenly can be dangerous whether medical drugs or not theyre certainly not pleasant i found though that the building up to the procedure was more unpleasant than the procedure itself  thats an interesting point though about the liquid form how old is he mom   to the forums btw hiya welcome to the site i suppose it depends on what the anxiety is for for me i dont like meeting new people much because unless theyre quickly identifiable as being interesting then i dont really care much for casual chat  i read how to win friends and influence people by carnegie thats a good read for avoiding babble its only a few pence on amazon id buy that if i was to recommend something  i used this practice for going to meetings when i didnt want to go but essentially the skills are transferable to every day life with social anxiety  either way  to the forums sparkle  hi gamer  to the forums   hopefully youll find some advice in here as well as somewhere to chat  have a nosy about there are serious sections and chillout sections the same yes this works was really comfy in bed and fell asleep really quickly good idea   the things we do eh   i dont care me if people say i looked stupid my only care is sufficient sleep and ill try anything within reason  ive put the hot water bottle in the freezer again for tonight as it predicts a very hot night   ive had all windows open all evening and its cooled the house down nicely it was like an oven when i came in from work upstairs especially  walking up the stairs reminded me of that wooosh when a aeroplane opens its doors when going somewhere hot   ive had to shut them all though because a new neighbour has started a fire and its mega smokey theyll be popular with the neighbours as everyone has their windows open    i saw on bbc news it say in the day close the curtains and leave windows close where the sun is coming in and open windows on the shade side this keeps the house cooler hi goticetea   music looping is quite common i think have a read of this wiki page  ive always had this as long as i can remember horrible thing it is i find that by putting my headphones and playing the thing it helps get rid of it kawasaki i agree with top line tilta   no comment on second because i dont know  i would disagree with 3 unless absolute wits end  single mixers 1 second of that would annoy me first i would switch channels to the forum dani     no it existed before but in my opinion these type things will create more people with who will have it in a word yes i tend to find its the day after that this occurs if ive over done sugar ive not got a sweet tooth at all so perhaps nature is telling me that i dont need the amount that i might consume   our bodies crave and need sugar however in todays western world its easily and readily available to take in excess well caffeine of course is physically addictive sugar however is an absolute necessity very close urges though    i wouldnt say im addicted to caffeine but quite frankly if the gun laws were different in uk and someone attempted to hijack my coffee or tea in the morning then the gun would come out pop   i thought people across the atlantic used soda as the term or is that just usa in fact i dont even think our southerners use this term  my new at the time dentist told to me that that is why my teeth were knackered when i told him i dont and never have had a sweet tooth   i didnt agree with him but kept quiet  as im sure its hereditary but i cut down on pop all the same  1 sugar in tea though im listening to the beautiful south  and smoking edit cigs of course to help   it works for some to the forums wolf yep and i would say the older i get the more this occurs its most of the time when im not in peoples company but also very much so when im in unfamiliar company  the above poster mentioned selfawareness and this is what it is imo hi it can be quiet on here at night in uk time where did this come from ama to the forums i dont really understand upset so not sure i can help any more i try to the forums  dont worry about long posts a manwoman after my own heart i find avatar changes most confusing i tend to relate avatars with posters     hope work goes ok tc im just off but thought id say  to the forums im not sure there is an complete alternative well legal anyway   i think trying to just switch is tough cutting out a few caffeine hits and replacing them is probably best start its funny not literally how we all differ  being home alone is when im least anxious if i had the money id live like this for me with time adjustments that is enough to create all the symptoms in me too mb   im trying everything after waking up at ridiculous oclock today to try and sleep im playing both my the cranberries album and this simultaneously  to try and tire no temptations please  im not even clicking on that i agree that things are not for everyone   i find links to things and look further and eventually find things that help in certain circumstances so i have a lot of saves well youve lost me john but welcome anyway to be fair danplex that is perhaps thee most interesting first post ive seen  and the best first reply   i have to say rob i also watched that and it perhaps made me feel like 63 of all my 25 years of writing instantly became plagiarism   anyhow welcome to the site danplex dont apologise for the whinge cora  i hope these swings level soon   x the sunday dinner comment looks a bit flippant sorry it wasnt meant to be   i think im just hungry and thought of my mums dinners lol\n",

      "doc: hello queries    as you have tried everything pretty much i feel so very bad for you it is very demoralizing to have some success and then end up back where you started six months laterwhenever i got stuck i turned to books and once a long time ago found this booksee linkwell it is cbt based but very well presented and easy to use and well it stopped the worst problems that i had with anxiety i can make it go away for years at a time using the exercises in this book and if it starts up again just redo over the exercises in the book and nip it in the bud againoh so give it a go it is worth a try for the price if there is any chance at all it will work and stop the anxiety and as i say it did for megot rid of anxiety intrusive thoughts catastrophizing and all better than any drug or therapist  the anxiety and phobia workbook new harbinger selfhelp workbook anxiety  phobia workbook amazoncouk edmund j bourne books i agree isolation is a major cause cos when you do go out it feels strange and you feel out of it and ill equipped to be sociali think the way to break the cycle is to force yourself to go out more the more you do it and the more you try to talk to and get on with people the easier it gets to feel comfortable around peoplei had an isolated childhood and adolecence i think that had a lot to do with it  also when i had my psychosis i lost a lot of my social skills which took years to learn and the psychiatric drugs made me withdrawn and shyi got through it and with the help of self help books i got my social skills and confidence back  i still get nervous around strangers and afraid but can talk more if the person i meet is someone i feel comfortable withbeing bullied makes you afraid too and causes lack of trust and many wounds and emotional baggage that gets in the way of friendships and relationships amazoncouk how to talk to anyone leil lowndes books hello winterfallit sounds like not being able to access the emotional part of your life so far due to the aspengers is causing you to sound overintellectualised when you speak to othersdont fret and worry about it  though i do understand how it might upset you when others dont see who you really are when talking to themi have ptsd too so it is doubly hard i know and well done for keeping up your physical appearance but i get that too when people think well outwardly you are getting on with it and everybody feels like that  i was once suicidal and told someone i thought  would understand she was a family friend more than a friend of mine she turned round and saidi feel like that we all do everyone does we just cant show it we have to pretend everything is alright and get on with it and then she switched on her false self and pretended i was a weird one and carried on with her partyingi guess if we get that sort of reaction we are talking to someone who is in trouble that was themselves and sometimes even therapists are sinking deep inside and see you looking good and doing ok and think  well i am here to help you but actually i need you to be strong and get on with it and go awaycos deep down they need help toodo you think this is so  welcome to the forum vic  hello i am sorry that you are going through so much pain and feel alone trapped and frightened first of all it is great you were able to get all that out and down on paperyour writing isnt an incoherent ramble at all but well written and expressed i think you have done well to cope with all that it sounds terribly hard to handle those anxieties everyday and i can see why you feel trapped with these problems and alone and frightened so does the ocd part of your illness mainly involve keeping things spotlessly clean and doing your particular ritualsi think the people at work have accepted in the whole you do these rituals and dont think any the less of youit is understandable you might worry different and fear about losing your jobi doubt though they want to lose you if you have been a diligent loyal employee for years the problem with food is worrying starving yourself for weeks is not good for your health of your emotionseating loads of junk food and throwing it up is really unpleasant a thing to experience you arent failing at life though far from itbut you have a lot of anxiety and a lot of fears which are hard to live and cope with i have had severe paranoia in the past which went away for years and returns for a while then goes againi have it at the moment actuallyi feel people are talking about me and staring at me laughing and judging me and saying i am unacceptable that they will reject me and think i dont deserve to be treated wellthat i am a drain and a waste of their time and resources  vic you do have severe anxiety it is so hard for you i knowhopefully there are ways a psychiatrist can helpyou need to know you are feeling bad because of the illness of ocd and anxiety and the eating disordeer not because you are a failure or weirdwith the right help and love and understanding you can get better and will feel well againdont worry about losing your job it will be okwell done for getting this all off your chestthis is a good place this forum you will find lots of support and help here i hope things start getting better and with help puts you well on the way to recoverynicolax hi sebastor no you should not feel bad for standing up for yourselfi was the same as you i was a wimp too nice and wouldnt speak out if someone was putting me down or bullying methe trouble with that is it makes you feel so bad inside and really you lose respect for yourself i used to find it so difficult to confront someone about something they said or did against mebut one day something just snapped into place i was angry about a pair of shoes that didnt fit and hurt my feet and so fed up of taking crap of people usually i would shy away from speaking out or drawing attention to myself i asked the assistant in the shop for my money back but she said no so i asked to see the manager and ended up shouting and making a scene in the shop for a full twenty minutes in front of an audience i didnt get my money back but i left there ten feet tallit felt so good to finally speak up for myself and my rights from then on it was the most natural thing to do to assertively stand up for my right to fair treatment and so now if anyone from family to friend or stranger steps out of line and criticizes or puts me down unfairly i will automatically stand up for little mei feel it is my right nowit is hard at first as part of being too nice is to defend others and not care about yourself but if that goes on for any length of time then it starts to be frightening to be around people and you start to be a bit of a coward so you do need to stick up for your personal rights invest in a good assertiveness book to give you an idea how to go on the one i liked was called a woman in your own right by anne dickson or there is one called when i say no i feel guilty by manuel j smiththere are lots more titles on amazon good luck and dont feel bad sticking up for yourself once you start it will begin to feel goodnicolax hey guys  i have impending doom syndrome too what with fukishima radiation and chemtrails and pollution and so much destruction and crueltythere is a new internet radio station the peoples voice and they are showing programs about the threat to our freedoms from government laws stopping people growing their own food and how tptb are planning to starve us all and kill us one way or another to deliberately reduce the population they say there is weather modification going on and that gmo food is meant to give us illnessthat they can give us cancer and even though they have the cure and have had it over twenty years they make more money from giving us chemotherapy so let us sink or swim with their treatmentsthey talk of an  iminent financial crash and complete chaos out of which they will create a military controlled surveillance society of a fascist communist nature they will destroy the ability of the earth to sustain human life every day i see evidence that some of this is true and i feel i cannot bear the truth of this that i am alone in being awake to all this and that i will be starved by having my benefits stoppedi am well supported by them and by my cmht so can see that i personally am not under attack far from it but i hear stories every day of people that are sufferingi want to help to change the wrongs to rights to heal the destruction of the earth with my love and good heart  i see the massive hurts and injustices and think is it any different now to twenty years ago in the 1980s we had the nuclear accident at chenovyl in russia and now we have fukishuma what is different now is all the music industry is promoting satanism and luciferianism in its popular culture like katy perry performing at the grammys this year she was doing witchcraft on stagei think well it is true it is the sane ones that are mad and us with mental illness we are actually the sane ones i try to talk to my family about all this but they go deaf dumb and blind on me they see it but dont acknowledge the potential for danger i wonder what you think guys and if you can help me get a grip from it all as it is sometimes a heavy load to be awake and aware of all this i guess it is really hard to connect with others who understand all this as most people walk around in their own bubbles or false security and reality  i would appreciate some hugs guys sorry i havent been around much but will make myself more available to support and share with you alli hope i havent caused any of you to e depressed with all this which is really me dumping my fears on this page in the hope i can minimize them  thanks for listening guys  nicolaxxx topcatthanks one of my favorite rem songs that and losing my religion though i did and got it back againfeel crappy today so am clapping my hands cpuusage thank you for your reply it really helps and you are so right we cannot get others to listen and we can only work on ourselves and it does no good to worryi feel much less afraid after reading your postto you both nicolaxxx\n",

      "doc: is there neurological basis for sa i feel like i could improve up to a point but it also feels like just part of who i am lifelong and never to completely vanish havent done the check ins in a while so making the rounds checked in in depression but anxiety is bothering me more at the moment so here i am bad intrusive thoughts today dont know what to make of them i really hate that ive been getting them lately they make me feel like a monster i feel wired my hands are shakey my head is hurting why does anxiety have to manifest physically too i just want to relax but i never can i wish my fiance understood that hi everyone before i get started i want to tell you a bit about my past i was diagnosed with social anxiety 10 years ago and would say the time when i was 1415 years old was the time where my anxiety was the absolute worst i couldnt go to school anymore because i was afraid to talk in class felt like people where staring and laughing going to the supermarket was nearly impossible life was a nightmare things slowly started to get better when i turned 18 and i even started a small job at a factory who hires people with mental disorders almost 2 years ago but in the past 68 months things have been going downhill again my best friend ditched me without warning coworkers who used to talk to me stopped doing so some of them now happily greet my husband but ignore me completely while im right there he cant explain why either which is driving me crazy there are also two coworkers who stare at me all the time i hate it i always feel like people are staring at me and giving me judgemental looks i know im far from pretty and look a bit weird but i also feel like i might be behaving weird i just want to be invisible something is wrong with me and i feel like everyone knows it everyone sees it and they all hate and judge me for it and thats why ive often been a victim to bullies teachers even strangers there is a mother with 3 kids 46 years i think who takes the same bus as i do to get to work and even her two sons have pointed and laughed at me before they dont speak german or english so i once again dont even know what was so wrong and funny about me its always like this did i act weird said something stupid made a mistake going out is getting more and more difficult i already cancelled going to the movies with my friend twice and started hating my job my workplace will be somewhere else soon so we will share the building with other workgroups now and i will have to use a different train to get to work which is already stressing me out there was a man on the train today who was staring nonstop for like 3 stops i looked back at him because for a moment i got so angry but when he didnt stop i quickly looked away again because i was afraid he would start yelling or something my husband has anxiety related anger issues which can be problematic when we go out hell start complaining about other people on the bus get angry if someone just looks at him in a weird way or even bump into others if he feels like they are blocking the way i cant talk to him about this hes suffering from his own demons and he would feel betrayed its the last thing i want i feel ugly weak dumb like a coward or a failure and everyone seems to know it i want to be invisible i want to stay at home and not see anyone beside my family and husband anymore even posting this here on a public forum is stressing me out but i dont know what to do sorry this text got so long i feel the same when im out as if everybody is laughing at me you are not a coward or a failure in fact you are brave and strong for facing this i am so anxious today because i think i need to talk to my boyfriend about moving out ive had this apartment for almost 2 years and he moved in shortly after i did everything was good for a while but now were having financial problems and can barely afford to stay here especially with rent going up again next month im at a point where i feel like i have to decide between things that i shouldnt have to decide between like buying a quick snack or going hungry all day or getting my medication or restocking the kitchen i think we need to move back home separately because thats the only way we can save any money hes not going to like it i dont even like it but i cant keep going like this anymore ive had social anxiety for as long as i can remember when i was a child i couldnt speak at all in school i was very chatty with my parents but i was completely mute at school my teachers didnt even realize i could talk at first my therapist now says i would have been diagnosed with selective mutism if i saw a psychiatrist at that time starting around age 5 i would have panic attacks at school that were so severe i would pass out throughout my childhood i saw so many doctors and cardiologyneurology specialists trying to determine the source of my episodes now known to be panic attacks so my social anxiety was compounded by hypochondria and the constant fear that my heart was going to explode i also felt like a weird sick kid with all my doctors appointments and would get so embarrassed when i was dizzy or passed out in front of the other kids i would be afraid of having an episode which would make an episode more likely to happen im sure people with panic attacks are familiar with this feedback loop i continued to not have treatment for my social anxiety and was so afraid of speaking i had very few friends and always received poor class participation marks school was always a major social anxiety trigger as i hated being around so many other people my mom thought she was helping my shyness by forcing me into so many extracurricular activities soccer tennis theater piano church groups community service clubs when i was older working at jobs that had high social interaction requirements and i remember my childhood just a big ball of anxiety i picked up some maladaptive coping behaviors to deal with the anxiety i was a huge daydreamer  while the other kids talked to eachother i would sit alone and escape into fantasy worlds in my brain i also started self injurying around 7 years old when i was in my late teens i developed an eating disorder as ive gotten older i am now well into adulthood im more in charge of my lifestyle and dont have to force myself into social situations i dont have many friends and i long for more social contact but its difficult i tend to cycle through phases so some times i am better than other times the idea of going to a social gathering makes me feel sick when i get very overwhelmed sometimes i literally get sick and have to throw up i think being an adult i feel more functional because im less anxious more of the time  but really ive just managed my schedule in a way that im incredibly avoidant of any kind of social trigger im a graduate student now and mostly work independently on my research which is nice my major triggers now are when i have to give presentations at meetings or for my committee anxiety has taken over my life i am 38 and have zero friends no spouse no children nothing not exactly where i saw my self being this anxiety stems from many many many years of abuse from father to boyfriend verbal emotional and physical i dont like anything about myself and i feel that others dont as well i even tend to only see family when i have to i dont like talking on phone i would rather text it seems like i can get out what i want to say better by writing than by talking my mind moves way faster than my mouth but i can type fast and seem to keep up the strange part of my life is this i work as a pit boss in a casino and i have to be around and talk to people for 8 hours or more and i have no problem whats so ever i enjoy my job very much and i think its because these people dont know me they dont know what ive been through they dont know how i feel about myself when i look in a mirror its like i am a completely different person at work i am confident and outgoing i smile and laugh unless it is slow when it gets slow my thoughts creep back in and i get really quiet i am at a point where i think i need to talk to someone but i dont know where to start i currently have a psychiatrist who only fills me with meds they even diagnosed me with bipolar i or bipolar depression but i dont feel that is whats going on am i depressed yes 100 my life sucks i have also had a very rough life that i dont know how to let go of and move on i have had no guidance just me winging it that is not obviously working from the time i was little i was bullied at school i have a very abusive father and followed suit in boyfriends i feel i dont know how to be happy or what it is supposed to feel like i have so much built up anger and maybe i need some anger management on top of therapy so if you are a person that knows me personally i probably will not attend anything i am invited to unless it is a life changing event i really dont want to be that person any more i want my life back please help im going to orientation with m in midjuly for 2 days the parents  students sleep in the dorms every interaction weve had with this school has been top notch im less anxious and more excited about this now shell get a quality education with no student loan debt i feel like weve been blessed today is sunny so i get to float in the pool i also feel like cleaning the house a little good day so far hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling feeling down today i have zero motivation and there are so many things to do i dont know whether this lack of motivation is my depression and anxiety or the meds i take whatever the causeim sick of it im giving up days months and years of my life to this i feel like just giving up there are no answers what can i do hope everybody is doing ok and hugs to all those that are struggling hi all i had been isolating myself for so many years due to my chronic social anxiety that i was becoming so depressed and very close to suicide i decdied to do something about it and started going back to my mental health clubhouse where i have known alot there for years but would only drop in once a year or so i am now going on 4 days straight there its nice you get a free cup of coffee in the morning and lunch is only 50 and they have a free salad bar if you have no money and a snack bar to buy snacks and the day is structured around a work order day where u can work in the kitchen or in business doing data entry or reception answering phones there are alot of jobs and things to do and if u cannot or do not feel comfortable working they do not make you it runs from 7am till 330pm and they have people who will take you to the pharmacy to pick up meds and just a number of things they help you with they even have a small clothing store in the club where u can purchase clothes for a quarter each monday tomorrow will be day 4 and it feels so good to break out of my self made prison at home and get out i got to the point that i knew i was dying and was going to die and was getting super super depressed staying in the same clothes on the couch doing nothing everyday and just alone with my own thoughts and i decided i had to make a drastic change no matter how hard it would be i am no where near well but i am now trying to break out of that shell and trying hard not to be afraid of people and talking and realizing that i am just as valuable as they are this has been so good for my mental health and has got me eating on a regualr basis too because i am getting a decent lunch each day going there today i feel good about the changes i am making and i look forward to any feedback or advice or suggestions anyone else has about breaking out of the isolation and socializing  i am diagnosed with social anxiety disorder i thought i had depersonalisation disorder and general anxiety disorder but every psychiatrist i went to see told me that i had social anxiety and depersonalisation was a symptom of it ive been taking prozac for the past few months and it has been great i used other drugs before but none have had positive effects ever but with prozac i feel like another person now i am so much more talkative and a lot more relaxed sure i still have attacks sometimes but those dont bother me now and theyre not that strong now but daily stress wow thats over like a shelter in my brain shut tight i dont care anymore and i am a brand new person i even have a job that is all about talking to people ive never met like all day and im not bothered heres the thing although prozac has made me a better version of myself ive drugtaking problems honestly first few months ive been good i took every single day the amount that my pych told me to but today while drunk i took more i swear i have no idea why i may have wanted to see what happens this is not the first time im doing this ive never been suicidal my entire life i just want to take more also i know that this ssri is so good to me so theres no way that im stopping but i know that i should stop taking more than my psyc recommends also im developing a drinking problem hadnt had this in like two or three months i know i need help but my closest visit to my psychologist is like three weeks later and my psychiatrist prescribed 6 boxes of prozac and told me off till january so i cant really seek pro help right now so yeah help i know i need it im very similar i tend to care about people and want to help them but i dont understand them at all at i feel ok in a small group of people where everyone has passed my dangertrust test but at the end of the day i need a lot of time on my own only then i can fully relax and be myself when im with people all i can think of is how not to embarrass myself and what are they thinking of me i think ive turned a corner with my depression and anxiety ive been up and out doing things with no anxiety i cried buckets of tears this week and it was cathartic im ready to let my daughter go i am at peace i feel good today hope everyone is ok and hugs to those that are struggling strong anxiety again tonight i was off work sick a few days last week so its been five days at home the sitting at home alone has raised my anxiety not enough distractions and it makes it harder to go back to work tomorrow also those issues havent gotten 100 better yet but i feel a pressure that i have to go to work tomorrow to call in sick again i wouldve had to get a doctors note on friday and i didnt because i was sure id be better by monday and also because i dont want to go to a doctor with vague symptoms also havent been sleeping well all week which adds to my night time anxiety i went ice skating for an hour this morning and i felt tired all day afterwards logically i should have no trouble sleeping tonight but i have this strange body which sometimes even cant sleep because of yoga class in the evening hi lavender i am a 57 year old woman and i suffer from the same symptoms as your daughter i used to be before the depression anxiety sleep disorder and also a bad case of hypothyroidism which has its own nasty corollaries an outgoing social person especially gifted at selling high end jewelry i was outdoorsy loved to travel alone often and excelled at making friends now i am isolated almost all of the time i am married but never had any childreni met my husband fairly late in life he is generally kind but very much a workaholic and not good at expressing or dealing with emotions he is remarkably unaffectionate and that really doesnt help i can understand where your daughter is coming from so well a gentle touch is what is needed lots of reminders of how much she is loved and supported by you makes an awful lot of difference i too become physically ill abdominal pain headaches and surprisingly powerful lower back pain have all been experienced when i have social interactions to attend on those occasions wild horses could not get me out of the house i have access to a wonderful gentle therapist but going to spend sessions with her has become so painful i can no longer bring myself to go yes i understand it is a resource i should not squanderand yes this causes me anxiety as well over the guilt i feel being trapped in this vicious cycle is to me often worse than the depression itself no i do not have one single explanation for its arrival in my life i think of it as i think of my depression brain chemistry running a little amuck there is no external single cause yes it all makes me very lonely at times but i am comfortable and safe in my home and for now thats how it has to be for me fortunately in my case i have an artistic side and do often naturally enjoy lots of time to myself in peace and quiet so its perhaps not as crippling a situation for me as it might seem on the surface i have taken baby steps to help myself and my medication does a bit for me in that way the most help i have gotten is talking with others about this and realizing i am not alone an 8week cbt course was also useful to me but came with its own share of difficulties some of the techniques i learned in it were very helpful however and do still help me now a few years on there is supposed to be an anxiety workbook famous because of its blue cover and wellreceived by therapists which has helped a great many people that may be a place to start i wish i could be more help but i wanted to reach out to let you know that it happens to very lovely peopleit is no fault of yours or hersand that little by little her pain and confusion can be greatly lessened and even possibly cured lots of people deal with this there is hope especially as she is so much younger than me and not yet soured or cynical about some things wishing you both all the best ive always wanted to be a social butterfly and love meeting new people for the first time but after the first few times i start to feel obligated to have that person in my life though i cant bring myself to socialize regularly sometimes i really hate myself because im sure people think i feel some way towards them but its all in my head i can talk to my boyfriend at times about how im feeling i like that he always reponda with i understand and it makes me feel good then i start thinking does he really or is he just saying that to sooth whatever anxious feelings im having so we dont have to continue talking about it i feel like a consistent burden to him i was quite anxious earlier today this is unusual as i have happily been anxiety free for months while yes i have been nervous or on occasion worried it is the numbing disabling anxiety that occurred this morning basically i volunteered for a large event it turned out i was redundant while the job really only required one person there were four of us present which meant standing around stupid yes but such situations make me anxious part of it is that i dont want to be seen to be standing around doing nothing it is so unprofessional part of it too is that the silly chit chat that occurs in such situations makes me uncomfortable i feel like such a tool i was getting overwhelmed so i asked to go home but this wasnt entirely a relief as i feel guilty for bailing on the others still sick now with a cough im hopeful because usually when i start coughing the cold is just about over roofers finished the back part of the house theyre doing the front tomorrow hopefully before the storms hit in the late afternoon spent most of the day reading i finished one book but i still have a few i havent read yet daughters boyfriend is making spaghetti for dinner its good because i can use some comfort food without me sniffling over the stove anxiety is okay considering physically i feel like crap im 48 years old ive lived my entire life feeling stresseduncomfortableawkwardsad i now suffer from ulcerative colitis  hypertension  sleep disorders the cumulative effect of these issues have left me feeling hopeless im pretty much living just waiting to die ive had a little therapy but didnt see it helping now i feel ashamed that im so mentally weak dont see any way possible to get better robert so very anxious today people are in and out of my apartment building outside door is right out my front door theyre in and out of the basement which is on the other side of my front door both of these doors are loud enough loud enough to not be drowned out by the tv i feel so broken down and helpless its just making the anxiety worse i just want to be left alone but im scared someone will come over having bad anxiety and panic attacks today as it gets closer to my daughter leaving for college the more anxious i get am trying coping techniques and they are not working neither is my medication i feel paralyzed with fear right now hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling i feel awful when i get them too sorry they have come back for you hope they stop soon take care its a new group an old friend created it for an event hence i get to talk to new people i decided topicrelated to advertise a remix i made and asked to like and subscribe the video if they liked the remix i also said i will also gladly accept criticism with a smiley i got no responses and started overthinking probably out of anxiety did they not like it did my message look like one of those spam messages some people send to many groups at once from this point i will say i did intend to personally share it with the new group though i wanted to fulfill my interest of growing my subscription number to fulfill a current desire to be recognized for what i do do they think im selfish now was my message garbage am i garbage or selfish for sharing my remix this way i feel kinda garbage after seeing no one responding feeling better today no anxiety and my daughter is 2 hours away at six flags with her friends she stayed on the mountain with her father last night and im doing ok i think the anxiety will probably come and go until ive fully adjusted but i feel hopeful today that it wont kill me hope everyone is doing ok and hugs for those that are struggling hi guys i just signed in on impulse as the last week has really hit home the enormity of my situation and im wondering what to do about it well im severely socially anxious and agoraphobic i need my mother with me when im out but i also need her with me just to talk to somebody today i went to the doctors for my blood test results and a home hairdresser came for a consultation about my brass problem i feel really angry with myself about the way i talk and my body language ive known this is a problem for years but im sick and tired of it now and im desperate to get a new lease of life going i talk and act very adolescent im 27 i bumble i mumble i fidget im not articulate i look angsty and feel it too and im very uncomfortable i feel like a teen whos self conscious in her new body and angsty hormonal mind and i can feel myself displaying that body language i hunch i shuffle my feet very ungracefully practically stomp when i walk and i talk in an unclear way when im very anxious and upset i look quite severe and moody and it doesnt help that my face looks younger than i am so i feel like i just scream teenager im so scared and uncomfortable and i lack social skills i want to move and speak the way other adults do its hard to explain what i mean but i watch them i watch other women when im out they wear more grown up clothes i do love my ripped jeans and floral vans though they walk more feminine and maturely they speak clearly with no confusion no awkwardness they seem to have more grace even if theyre not graceful i think the hairdresser really reminded me of how differently i move and speak she wasnt a glamazon like many hairdressers she was a perfectly nice ordinary woman in practical day clothes but she spoke clearly she spoke confidently its hard to explain but she had that adult way that i want i want to speak clearly too i want grown up mature body language right now as i have been for over 10 years im a high school kid hunched and hiding behind her hair eyes darting around laughing nervously how can i change it im meant to be getting a support worker but its been 2 months or more and i still havent heard from anyone despite my therapists looking into it i thought maybe she could help me but i dont know how i feel like what i need is selfcontrol mindfulness a good strong dose of diazapam role play could someone work with me to help me learn body language speech social skills i see the way other people interact as adult and proper and i want to have those speech and body languages skills too like an actual functional adult but i dont know how to learn it or who can help the therapist im seeing right now is psychoanalytic on the nhs were just looking at my past ive mentioned my body languageteenage speech to others who have worked with me in the past but they just ask me what i mean by teenagery and then laugh ill stop here as i do have a habit of writing a lot hi everyone im struggling at the moment with what i think could be some form of social anxiety and wondered if anyone had any advice i had a quick look at the forum and couldnt see anything recent that fit with my scenario please bare with me as it might take a bit of explaining since i started my masters ive been having recurring bouts of anxiety surrounding my identity not in terms of what hobbies and films etc that i like more in terms of personality when i began my masters i was thrust into a really odd environment where my old lecturers or teachers became more like colleagues i really struggled to fit in and felt like i was really boring and no one was interested in me as i result i tried everything to modify my personality to make myself more interesting so i could be loved by everyone i found certain things triggered me and it was things like watching movies where the character was well liked so for instance i love the film tangled but whenever i watched it i wanted to be like rapunzel because everyone loved her when i watch lost i want my personality to be like hurley because everyone loves him i know this probably sounds really bizarre but it honestly triggers the confusion over my identity this has been going on for about 2 years now but it makes me feel so awkward as well when im in this confusing period i dont feel very sure of myself and i feel awkward like everyone knows im being fake and not authentic i dont even know how to act when im just sitting down im worried i look awkward dont know what to do and that everyone is judging me when i talk to people im absolutely desperate to be myself but im more desperate to be liked this now not only happens with my colleagues but also with friends who i dont feel comfortable with i also find myself getting hot sweaty and nervous when im in these situations i know i have too much dependence on what other people think of me and i cant seem to shift it i think it comes from low self esteem and not thinking that im good enough trying all these different identities tires me out and at the end of the day i just want to be myself but ive worn so many personalities mine has actually got lost in there somewhere i just want to learn who i am so i can be that person or there abouts all the time when i say that to people though they say everyone acts different around different people but i feel so anxious and it seems to affect me more than other people i actually know that im probably doing a selffulfilling prophecy and that because i dont know how to act i stay quiet or am awkward and then people dont like me as much i know that if i were myself people would probably like me more anyway i also know that people wont always like me and that some dont now and that i have to just live with it i just dont know how to rediscover myself im grouchy and stuff because i dont want to live my whole life being a fake i want to be my real self and be sure of who that is and confident so i dont feel awkward i dont want to worry what others think about me but i cant stop any tips advice thank you so much i loved the answers thank you i do agree too i have been doing a lot of hobbies recently but i dont have too much time to do them as im so busy working on my masters the hobbies do help i took up painting recently and also had some worries about identity surrounding my art work wanting to get myself across but then also being inspired by other artists and wanting to be as good as them i think definitely the stress has really got to me im not too far from the finish line now so im hoping once its over ill feel better i just need to make sure im not people pleasing when i decide what i want to do next and do what i want to do for myself i liked what you said about having friends even when being yourself i think with the friends im talking about and the ones i feel least comfortable with we were all thrown together at school and so we have a wide range of interests and i dont feel as interesting to those people as i do to the ones i feel comfy with thank you for the reply i really appreciate it its good to vent these things sometimes i feel you lived my life the same way i feel its a lot easier to talk to my coworkers then people in my group who also have mental illness i still dont talk to my coworkers a lot though if that makes sense yay i got my daughter off to college with no anxiety or panic attacks we took two cars and i did cry going and coming but i was positive and upbeat with her while we were fixing up her room then i hugged her for a long time and left i feel okay yay hope everyone is okay and hugs to those that are struggling not doing so well today which is a bummer the last few days have been fantastic but somehow this evening everything started to spiral out of control i feel and think my co workers are conspiring and talking about me behind my back i know this may not be true but not sure the problem with this is the thoughts lead me to become incredibly anger and i dont want to get violent based off false beliefs that really hold no weight also just a few minutes ago while smoking on my front porch i killed a black window ortho home defense works really well btw now since i have my son this weekend i cant help but to think what may have happened had he been here or what could happen this weekend just checked all shoes near the entrance door for fear spiders may be in them now i know this is going to be come something i do religiously help anxiety has taken complete control of me already this morning im dying everything is crashing down on me and i just cant make it i feel like im bordering on a major fight with my boyfriend which may be relationship ending i should post separately about this so i dont hijack this thread please help i plan a day at home to catch up on paperwork from being so far behind all summer and people call off i feel like i cant take a day off or everything goes to pot i know i need to have faith that other staff can handle it but right now i feel anxious and nauseous over today hi i am new to the forum i have increasingly felt like i want to stop talking as a bit of background i was the sensitive child  apparently in a family of very assertive and talkative people i can say now that they are quite domineering though i am an adult they still enjoy and feel entitled to offer their opinion about everything including my life choices even though i have children of my own now as a child i had a stammer which was quite severe at certain times and in certain situations i had speech therapy but it didnt resolve the problem i think i was reacting maybe to my childhood family situation which was difficult thankfully i always had good friends i also achieved ok academically and i worked in jobs which i enjoyed and which involved helping and working closely with vulnerable people i think my empathy kind of made up for my shyness and helped break barriers and i built good relationships with people it was like i hadnt had a voice in my family but at work i was valued i had a particularly nasty romantic relationship and when i went abroad to escape it i fell hook line and sinker for a charmer who became my husband he was abusive in every way but like many abusers abused me so cleverly that i didnt realise i was being abused until many years into the marriage i see now that he ride to keep me lacking in confidence sabotaging my development he was a loud person and had a booming voice loved to be centre of attention he wouldnt discuss things if we had any difference in views he would punish me if i tried to he used to tell me that he wishes i was nonverbal in my marriage my stammer returned to the severity that it had been when i was a child long story short i divorced him after becoming so unwell with his treatment of me i was so relieved to be able to tell people what i had been though i talked and talked it was like releasing everything i was free to talk no more secrecy i was diagnosed with ptsd and have been fighting that but something that has developed is my hatred of talking its not about stammering  my stammer is virtually gone now that he has its about a whole hatred of talking of talking myself or hearing other voices i wish i could go and live on a silent community where i never had to talk ever again or listen to other voices the feeling is getting stronger i dont know if social anxiety lies at the root of this i dont see myself as shy nowadays but maybe the ptsd is a cause also my ex tuned out to be such a liar telling dreadful lies about me in court and i have realised how he may be chatty and outgoing but every word he says is manipulative he uses people so now i feel repelled by loud people people who are witty and talkative  i had being around them and listening they just remind me of my ex trigger me and seem fake to me i am really worried that i will end up a total recluse i have two children and put on such a fake act in front of them sheltering them from the truth of my current issues well im definitely not depressed my daughter moved the rest of her stuff yesterday to her dorm her room is so empty ive been having horrible panic and anxiety attacks and wonder how im going to pull this off im keeping busy but i just feel sick i think this is particularly hard because were so close and because shes the only one who has seen the good bad and ugly of my illness and has always gotten it shes always been of the mindset that her mom is ill and sometimes we do things a bit differently and that is ok we have been each others support which some may disagree with but it worked for us whenever either of us was having a tough time just holding hands and saying everything will be fine would calm us right down she was going to stay and go to college here but i knew she needed to fly so i helped her with the bigger college 2 hours away that was the most loving thing i could do for her thanks for letting me rattle on i feel better now or that could be the valium sending big hugs well i will start off by saying i am a 38 year old female who lives by myself along with 2 dogs and 1 cat i have been living alone for 5 years now and have found my anxiety getting worse each year i used to be a very outgoing friendly happy person and now i am so insecure filled with worry and guilt and am so nervous to be around people because of what they may think of me and my life i literally have 1 girlfriend and i have known her for 24 years unfortunately over the years i have distanced myself from her because i feel i cant relate to her anymore she is married and has children i am divorced with no children i think in a way i distanced myself because i am jealous of her life ive always wanted a family and a home i currently have a boyfriend of 2 years now however the situation isnt really ideal for anyone he is currently married but they live in same house different rooms they are coparenting for the children while i love him to death i dont know if i am with him because i love him because i am lonely because i really want to be with someone because i like to punish myself or because i am just that messed up and think its what i deserve i have really had some abusive relationships in my life its seems to be what i attract he is not abusive at all he treats me very well but i want him to move out and finalize a divorce and we argue about it often this relationship goes along with this anxiety because truthfully i am a secret no one gets to know me in his family i currently work in a very customer service job i am a pit boss at a casino this job forces me to talk to people sometimes have uncomfortable conversations with them i supervise people and i am very outgoing however everyone thinks i am always angry because of the look on my face i dont smile when i am not talking to people aka resting bi face the truth is i am just nervous i dont want people to judge me im over weight and do not like how i look or feel about myself and i feel everyone else thinks just like i do the funny thing is once my shift gets going i forget all about the anxiety i dont know if its the business that takes the thoughts away from it or what but when the night slows down it all comes rushing back i find myself sitting alone in our employee dining room even though there are 50 people in there at most times i feel like i dont know how to converse with people and sometimes i feel like  are these people really that stupid thinking like that is really bad i dont feel i am smarter than people but i feel like i have way more common sense than some and unfortunately i feel like i talk to people like they are stupid and that is not my intention at all i try to talk so they come up with the right answer on their own while being guided and realizing just how little effort it takes to think a few more minutes and come up with the answer on their own but it comes out all wrong the anxiety then takes over my whole being and i just want to run far away sometimes i feel like im not myself when im at work like i get to be someone else the guests there dont know my personal life they dont know what ive been through so they just get to see happy me this anxiety isnt just work and friend related it is at its worst when attending family functions i really do not associate with family i cant breathe when i am around them i have been in my apartment for 5 years and i have never had them over i have 2 sisters and a father that live 1520 min from me and they have never seen my place i dont know what it is that freaks me out or triggers it i just wish it would go away and i could have my life back its pretty lonely being 38 and having no friends any suggestions im feeling monday work anxiety i feel extra anxious almost every monday but it doesnt make it any easier so anxious about money today it helps being woke by a call from someone who you owe money to sarcasm i really want to do credit counseling to figure this all out but the only place around is associated with the company i work for so im feeling too freaked out to try to make an appointment i dont know what to do i am on clozapine at night and it depresses me but also makes me sleep through the night that is why i take it at bedtime i need it for my schitzophrenia which makes nervous alot but for some reason today i feel pretty good yesterday i found out that the nerve block they put in my back was a trial run i had no pain for about 30 minutes then it hurt like hell until i took the muscle relaxer today was my birthday and im feeling better we went out of town for the day i got a new purse a crystal necklace and a set of headphones we also ate a ton of food looks like ill be cooking the rest of this month and next month but it was good i withdrew from my literature class im too stressed out to handle two hard classes ill take it again another term i want this to be accomplished but not losing my sanity doing it slow and easy anxiety will go down once the withdrawal is processed hope i can handle that im having some pretty intense anxiety today dealing with a few triggers have a ton to do but i feel completely unable to do them at the moment that in itself is making me even more anxious too i was sort of anxious this afternoon i realized i took my geodon late geodon is not for anxiety but when i realized i didnt take it i started worrying about that i feel okay now that ive taken it quotealpacalicious5409010when i think about my therapist i feel anxious i miss her i didnt see her this week maybe thats why also since this is a therapy service offered by my university when ill finish uni and that is soon on february ill have to stop seeing her i think so this hurt me a bit because i think ill miss her even more i wish i could stay more plus i feel the same problems are with me everyday i need therapyquote im actually afraid to start therapy because i would view the therapist like a best friend and would miss that person im really happy for you being able to control your anxiety is such an awesome feeling especially for me its been really difficult last week for me where i would just consistently feel anxious and let that dictate my actions and my lifestyle i nearly ruined my relationship with two people i really care and love this week has been much better and i have been able to work through my negative thoughts and emotions and in the long run control my anxiety it feels very accomplishing its hard to keep up sometimes because i feel like i am going to ruin it but i just keep going and improving its a practice and lifestyle and im glad that people are working through it slowly but surely hope your eye feels better fharraige my anxiety is still really up at the moment a lot of it related to people and relationshipsinteractions i think at times im feeling paralysed by anxiety and just want to crawl out of my skin im in recovery from a variety of addictionsprocess addictions and the only relationship i really feel good in is my one with my sponsor but i really start feeling bad when i just talk to him constantly and offload all my feelings on one person im going to cook for friends tonight nothing fancy i hate using the excuse that i will do something when i get better why not now so what if i feel tense and anxious i like making food and i shouldnt wait around for some mythical perfect day to do it edit it turned out alright weirdly i still had the tension from a random anxiety today but it didnt affect my mood tonight like it normally would my body just feels like it ran a marathon is all im feeling really anxious about work tomorrow im really not invested in this job anymore i just dont want to bother going im afraid of driving too and ashamed of it  i feel like i am not a real grownup even at 53 years old i do have a license and can drive if i absolutely have to but that is rare as long as it isnt dark raining and i dont have to take a highway or go anywhere unfamiliar i avoid if at all possible  it terrifies me oh dont worry i know  the stress is palpable and that makes things worse its a negative cycle today i feel the same and struggling with myselfi am really trying to keep bringing my mind back to the moment instead of letting it wander out to problems hello ive gone through the same social issues i currently have no friends outside my family because i feel really afraid to make some and i am in college not getting the full college experience well community college anyway i just wish i wasnt so afraid i know i can be a good friend and all but just taking that step to actually speaking to someone is where i struggle it might be that im a little critical of myself and afraid that those i approach might not find me interesting enough to want to actually develop a friendship with me because i can be a little different at times a mindset i believe my mental issues have contributed to but yes that is my social anxiety story oh i also am really uncomfortable going out to public places the whole i think im the center of the world thing and everyone is judging me is what makes me feel really uneasy another one with social anxiety here among others diagnosis socialy anxious since early childhood since ever worsened at my early teenage years and after that no friends anymore being very inhibited is terrible for professional life i restrain myself from choosing this or that path i feel so recluded from the world theres an all world experiences and knowledge that i dont have nor can i do i switched to decaf a few years ago had a migraine for a couple of days and i was fine i still like the taste of coffee but i feel less anxious now i used to drink a pot of coffee so i wonder why when anxious i have no desire to drink coffee when things calm down i tend to go back for the wake up and also the appetite suppression max is one to two cups a day maybe i should remove it and see how i feel long term havent had any coffee todayso far so goodno physical anxiety no chest anxiety i feel just fine maybe this was it ill know for sure in a few more days thanks for your replies guys appreciate it i had never officially been diagnosed with it but i probably did have some form of it i would refuse to talk to teachers uncles aunts etc but would be ok talking with kids my own age this went on until 7th grade it seemed to have come back when i became an adult im 24 and i can only talk to a few people in my group i dont always ignore them but sometime when they say hi i dont really say much of anything to them its like my vocal chords freeze i feel bad but its almost like i am physically unable to speak to them i still struggle with talking to close family members but i am very active on social media so i communicate with family members there i feel bad about it sometimes like we got a new neighbor and i couldnt really say much to her i just froze whats weird though is 1317 i talked fine and was actually very talkative and joked around with people of all ages then when i was 18 the traits of selective mute came back kind of all of a sudden im wondering if it was just an example of the fact that your brain doesnt fully develop until your 18 i really dont know theres a line in hg wells war of the worlds that crosses my mind a lot i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this mysterious deathas swift as the passage of lightwould leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down thats kind of how i feel sometimes im doing so much to get myself to a better place scrambling for safety as it were but i feel i am being toyed with by my anxiety like its just biding its time and will strike at me again just as i reach a good place some triggering material mentioned in this warning i have realized now that i have a really bad fear of pain it mainly shows itself in my fear of falling as i dont want to get hurt if i do fall but i cant say why i am scared of pain i know humans dont like to experience pain but i feel mine is really bad the fear its the main thing that holds me back from possible trigger self harming more severely and suicide function rejtgomb tag  gombparentnodeparentnodegetelementsbytagnamediv1getelementsbytagnamediv0 if tagstylevisibility  visible

anybody who may be laughing or looking at me its a weird feeling i get nervous that im going to embarrass myself or look stupid in front of strangers its also worse if im at a gathering with friends i will stay quiet because i dont want to say something stupid i will go as far as avoiding hanging out with my friends too because im soo scared i hate parties or anything like that basically anything where im around people im on alert and terrified i try my best to hide it and im not sure if my friends will understand how scary it is for me to be around people i only feel comfortable hanging out at my house too  if im in my room im okay but if i have to go to their house i start to panic im also scared of driving especially on highways but that stems from my ptsd i lost 4 of my cousins in a wreck when i was 11 and ever since then ive been super scared to drive my mom eventually got me to come around to the idea of driving when i was like 19 and i got my license around 21 idk  i feel like an idiot because these are things i shouldnt be afraid of but i am my anxiety keeps me from doing a lot of things and i wish it would just go away already am i alone do you get anxious over seemingly trivial matters do you feel embarassed and guilt ridden awkward i do all the time and i worry even more that people will laugh or think i am weird i feel humiliated as a result all too often tonight i am supposed to be test driving several vehicles on my short list i have been worrying about this since i made the appointment yesterday and this worry is going to fester all day today i am worried that i will make a fool of myself in front of the salesman who no doubt will come along ive had no car of my own for near two years so dont drive often i am in a new city i am unfamiliar with this shouldnt be difficult though so i feel idiotic as well why do i make mountains out of mole hills people take test drives all the time this is such a stupid thing to be frightened of there is so much more going on in my life to feel anxious about rather than this trivial matter nike ive had several of these tests and on each occasion i was given an open gown to wear they were able to reach beneath the gown to attach the sensors while i still felt vulnerable i wasnt completed exposed so i am really bothered by how they did this in your case in the future ask if you can have a gown to wear in the meantime i feel your awkwardness and humiliation it is frightening enough just having to have such a test to begin with let alone humiliating you and making you all the more anxious i feel like i hate having to dumb myself down when talking to certain people that bring up conversations with me that are completely uninteresting and petty i struggle with being nice to other girls in particular because i feel like im surrounded by simple minded people that do not have any interest at all in engaging themselves in current topics or their personal thoughts and beliefs on science research society etc my boyfriend probably hates bringing me around his friends wives i feel like im either too sharp or too loud when i talk to people i dont feel comfortable at all i am pretty good with strangers because i know i wont have to come up with more stuff to talk about because ill only see them for a short time when it comes to having to get to know someone thats when i feel my most uncomfortable im struggling with this right now very very much thanks everyone i find it difficult when i feel trapped by a conversation i dont know when the other person is going to stop talking or how i can get out of it without being rude or abrupt ok so my nose is huge and the main cause of my anxiety and i always think people are laughing at it when im out of the house am i being realistic i was in another forum and they said i might have bdd but i feel like im being realisticshould i save up for surgery and i was the last poster in that thread i feel so honoured i really do im feeling okay at the moment nothing extreme in november last month ive been dealing with daily bouts of anxiety that go up and down it sucks but i still manage to maintain despite my anxiety i feel like ive had a panic attack on my tail all day but i managed to outmaneuver and avoid it and had a decent day instead im very tired of fighting the battle with anxiety why cant i just be calm i have nothing bad happening in my life just the opposite but im scared and confused i just want to relax a little and enjoy my life why do i struggle with this im reading all types of things to try but i struggle to take consistent action i guess im looking for a magical fix instead of the hard work it takes to improve i tend to do the minimum and therein lies my major problem i think i have an aversion to hard work and so im stuck in this crappy mood where i feel like a scared little kid i talked to the person that was wanting to contact me i feel a slight relief it is strange how certain situations can ramp up the anxiety the situation might even be as simple as having to talk to someone that feels like a threat the person i talked to was nice to me i think i was overly worried about being embarrassed by the topic he was contacting me about i did feel some of that and some worry about his judgement i have to learn to stop letting fear of judgement and embarrassment stop controlling me how do you learn to let go of that fear the weirdest feeling for me is being on a med that stops the physical symptoms of anxiety and i feel great but when i have too much time to sit and think i start panicking in my mind and thinking omg maybe im dying because my heart isnt racing then i start breathing all weird basically panicking about not having a panic attack i feel overwhelmed by all the phone calls i have to do on tuesday all kinds of things are happening the wrong way i hope i can clear it all up im dreading it thats how i feel with i love you yea ok sure you do you dont hurt people you love my guess is maybe with time you might just react less but feel the same or with therapy maybe you will feel less negativity associated with them hmmmmm sugar is devils poop it is really bad for you i gradually tapered the sugar off started w no sugar in coffee then decreased and afterwards eliminated alcohol no soda no juice cut desert to one meal a week etc and i have to admit that it has had noticeable benefits reduced anxiety still heavy but not as intense increased concentration less foggy brain less depressed less fatigue the annoying part is that i feel much worse if i eat my favorite dessert but i also love it so i do eat my desert and suffer afterwards it is pretty silly hi i feel for you to be honest because the whole angerrage thing isnt really your fault its just the way it is for you but i have struggles along similar lines as well what i try to do is really stay aware of my emotions and feelings and watch what thoughts im latching onto and just try to let go of anything that might lead me toward an undesirable outburst scenario i havent perfected it but its definitely helping self awareness hang in there itsjustmehere its all a journey of inner growth hi all so i had a job interview today at a dog place the woman asked me reasons i wanted to work there besides dogs so i said to try and socialize more and she asked if i struggled with that i said well i can talk to people but it makes me a bit anxious sometimes then it got weird she proceeded to ask me things like are you taking any medications for that are you seeking professional help how long have you been seeing someone for it how long do you plan to is this why you need a certain time off each week does your therapist know you came here for this etc i answered out of pressure and being unsure of what to saydo but now i feel so violated she wrote it all down was this inappropriate or am i overreacting i just got the email today of my orientation date for an internship i applied for i have had a real problem with this all my life i will decide i want to do something a job volunteer school etc and back out at the last minute or worse quit midday and escape home i remember when i was like 7 years old i wanted to do gymnastics so bad i begged my mom to sign me up for it and she somehow managed to scrape together some money when i got there i went into the gym and freaked at the sight of all the kids bouncing around having fun i went and hid in the bathroom my mom had not even left yet and then i proceeded to beg her to take me home she was so mad and confused at my behavior i have managed to push myself to do some things but when i wanted to join ballet i was already 14 years old and felt much more comfortable in the adult class and that was how i was able to ease into that i did that for 10 years despite being self conscious about my body i even worked there for free lessons i did quit a few times though but returned after a few months break ive done this with a job i felt particularly comfortable with too i had gone through the horrible discomfort of starting that job but often felt like i could do something more so in a depressed and anxious mood i wouldnt go into work they would take me back 6 months later probably because it was retail and i was a good employee except for my little episodes they took me back 3 times over 7 years i finally quit for good 6 years ago and tried 2 other jobs one where i worked at home i ended up going back to school and only finished because it was online then i felt really ambitious and decided it would be a good idea to apply for a 3 month internship where i will go from no job at all to working 40 hours a week doing very physical labor getting up at 530am and having a long commute i have been so isolated out of shape and have really poor sleeping habits this feels like my last chance at having some sort of life im already midthirties with no kids never married i need something in my life but am too scared to go through with this the extreme shift in routine will be a shock to me and i dont know if ill be able to handle it i feel like i will blow this opportunity and am kicking myself that i didnt apply for something more pt first will i ever learn not to ignore my limits i dont want to burn bridges at this place because my plan for years was to eventually work there actually i have oscillated about really wanting this as a career too maybe because of the anxiety but maybe because of something else i dont know i have already started thinking of excuses to back out though i have 2 weeks to mull this over until it will probably turn into nothingness once again and i will be back where i started oh and the financial mess this behavior has left is growing as well even though i was lucky in a way to inherit a little money when my dad died i now have a giant student loan so really cant mess around anymore it has also done a number on my self esteem and dignity well im about to quit after 2 days in i am so weird and so tired of myself there are some people who might be considered weird right away but i appear normal to most people when they first meet me in fact i can even appear quite confident my problem is that once i am expected to loosen up after introductions or whatever i get real quiet people must think i am stuck up or dont like them or something no i am just really self conscious i dont know what to say the first day is fine because i can ask questions but when it comes to the little banter and joking around i just dont find it funny but get so exhausted fake laughing or smiling of course i do it though to be polite then people start talking about their husband or kids or vacations i just cant relate i am a weirdo who never got married or had kids and have always been too poor to travel i also didnt go straight from high school to college i went on and off for years trying different things it doesnt look good i wish i could just say that and then add that i only settle for inconsiderate guys who dont care about me at least i wouldnt have to fake being normal i cant even stand it anymore isnt there anyone like me im starting to think i have some sort of disorder where i am two different people one day i like certain things and the next day i am indifferent to the same thing my mood is usually different too and it is totally uncontrollable there doesnt seem to be anything that can bring me out of the mood ive been seeing a therapist in training and when i mentioned this to her she sort of ignored it i feel like im probably one of those people who need a different kind of help but am slipping through the cracks then that just confirms my thoughts about being too worthless for any therapist or doctor to care about i swear i just dont know why people go into certain professions no one seems to really care it just seems like they had to pick something as a career and are fulfilling their own selfish ambitions instead of genuinely wanting to help having horrible thoughts today i dont know anymore so i need to quit my job ive been back and forth on this for months i feel a lot of guilt over quitting at the same time i dread my job every day i dont enjoy it anymore its too timeconsuming and i cant devote enough time to myself or to school i have an hour long commute and i hate it i never get enough sleep im exhausted and just done the thing is im basically a babysitter i get to the house in the early am get the kids ready for school then take them to school i have a brief break while theyre there during which time i go back to their empty house too long a commute to go back to my own then i pick them up from school and keep them until the end of their single moms workday used to be they would come home and take a nap and i could do homework now though one of themnis in therapy every day after school so we drive 45 minutes to therapy sit there for 2 hours and drive 45 minutes back coupled with my commute a lot of driving the mom also got them a puppy for xmas which she wants me to take care of while the kids are in school im allergic to the pup so thats frustrating the mom has also been getting home later and later until my workday has consistently stretched more than an hour longer each day i need a bit of a break and im looking for workfromhome jobs the thing is i have so much anxiety over quitting i mean shes a single mom one of her kids just started therapy ive been teaching the other to read they just got a puppy shes been having a hard time at work ive been with them over a year my initial agreement with her was to work for her for a year the second that year was up she started begging me not to quit she raised my pay by a dollar an hour i feel like shes done as much as she can to keep me but i just dont want to be here anymore but im scared to tell her ugh i just got my degree and im in graduate school now i want work experience that isnt babysitting im super terrified of confrontation though any advice would help this is an anxiety that has plagued me since early childhood and i think that it dates back to the first grade when i was in the first grade there was a girl in my class that i was very visually attracted to i put it that way because i basically knew nothing about her other than that she was very pretty to my child eyes so like any little kid with a crush i started writing love letters to her but after reading them she would look right at me and tear them up the emotional pain from that was overwhelming to me even as a young child to make matters worse she later began to bully me by popping me with her comb that was emotionally painful too i dont know which stung worse the comb on my tender flesh or the sting of persecution to my heart even so i continued to want her to be my girlfriend but knew deep inside that that would never happen eventually my family packed up and moved to south carolina and for a long time i had no interest in other girls as i still dreamed of that one eventually in time i began to forget about her and just let it go but my interests in other girls didnt start up again until maybe the fith or sixth grade and this was for yet another who didnt return my affections and seemed to resent me the next year it was the same thing with a different girl and again the year after that i believe that after that was when i truly gave up oh sure as a teenager i still fancied other girls throughout jr high school but dared not approach them save for one who was really cool but we would just talk on the bus as she wasnt in any of my classes but i could never work up the nerve to try to take it any further than that by saying something complimentary like hey ashley youre really pretty you know that or ashley youre so cool so by that point in life or really by the sixth grade i could no longer tell pretty girls what i thought of them and i am still intimidated by attractive women to this day even when i do work up the nerve to talk to one which is very rarely i screw it up by not thinking it through enough first and when it doesnt work out i become super depressed and anxious about having no future that really matters and go buy some beer to calm my nerves even though i dont drink that much after that i feel a little better but still hurt inside so that is one of my biggest if not the biggest anxiety that i have i didnt mean for this post to be so long i guess i just had to get this off of my chest as it has tormented me for many years thank you for sharing this i feel this way too i definitely avoid confrontation and will sometimes act more cheerful just to avoid the possibility of confrontation although youre right that we all get angry from time to time it sounds like you also want a gentler world am i reading right if so i think what youre saying totally makes sense and that theres nothing wrong with your response sending good wishes for a gentle day today i am the same way i strongly dislike myself for being like a spunge even if someone is doing an anxious or an angry facial tic or expression i feel it in my stomach annoying same goes for angry emails news articles online comments my brain exaggerates them i get really scared and immediately get anxiety my only coping mechanism has been to ignore and escape which probably is not the wisest way to deal with the situation well i also go to therapy for the reasons that make my brain react that way but it has not really helped anyone else have to deal with this i used to be very confused by it even though i know its pretty common because my job is very low stress and i like my coworkers but i think its just dreading having so little time for myself and feeling like i didnt do everything i had planned on doing on the weekend both chores and fun stuff ive been wanting to go ice skating for the past 6 weekends but id have to go at 9 am because later theres too many kids on the ice and its chaos i feel like theres way too much on my to do list and i dont have much energy to do stuff after work plus i have yoga once or twice a week and class once after work the other two nights i have to do grocery shopping and cook for two days basically im already looking forward to friday and the upcoming week being over when it hasnt even started yet  the biggest problem with that is that i dont sleep very well on sunday night and then i start the week being exhausted and because i have to get up extra early on monday morning i feel like any time i take to relax stresses me more because i should be in bed already i have an early morning anyone have any tips did you feel anxiety going to school when you were a kid when i see kids waiting for a school bus i feel a little anxious i think i relate it to my childhood and fear i had around going to school at times and trouble i experienced riding the bus i was just wondering if anyone could help me with a dilemma i am having i want to start journalling ive noticed recently that my state of mind can alter dramatically throughout the day from the depths of despair to being ok i also have times when i have thoughts  or at least i think they are thoughts  but which at the time i think are real  then later when im trying to recall those thoughts or whatever they are and i cant anyway i keep thinking  particularly when im feeling bad  that i should go  see my gp but by the time i get an appointment even if its the same day i will probably feel better  either cancel or not be able to explain myself because of all of the above i thought that journalling would help me capture how im feeling in that moment  then i could take it with me to my gp the issue im having i dont know how to keep my journal if i keep it on paper format i live in fear of it being discovered  read by my family  if its going to work i need to be honest in what i write i dont want them to see it if i keep it on the notes section of my phone which feels like the safest place  im afraid of the data being lost  i dont know whether the gp will find it as easy to read all of this is bothering me  i feel mithered  undecided  then i become anxious just typing this is giving me palpitations im having the same issue with lists im trying write a to do list but i want it in a format that i can keep with the date next to the items as i do them so i can see how much or how little im accomplishing so it needs to be in a book or a pad where the pages dont come outand then i cant decide whether the things to do should be on the same page or in the same book as things to buy  what about my aims for 2018 should they have a separate page or book if i do them separately i end up with multiple books or parts of a book to keep checking  looking at  keep safe  again it just all becomes overwhelming im eally struggling with any kind of motivation to do anything at the moment i find no joy in anything i cant seem to think of anything i actually want to do so i just keep doing things other people are doing in the hopeactually i dont knowin the hope that ill stop feeling so lost sorry this post has kind of morphed im not even sure its in the right forum now desperation any help at all would be most appreciated thank you thank you both for taking the time to reply i hadnt thought about just doing some brief notes i will try that maybe it will be enough to jog my memory thank you and as daft as this may sound i didnt know there were such things as online journals thank you that could work i feel a bit calmer today sometimes i read my original posts  its like a different person has written them which i guess comes from the rapid changes in how i feel during anyone day thank you hello my anxiety has been getting worse to the point where i feel like an emotional wreck right now its so stressful worrying that something will go wrong all of the time and it sucks being anxious 247 because i just want some relief my next psychiatrist appointment is on november 16th and it just seems so far away i want to be better i think its a common fear amped up i have had many times when this came up about either my daughter or my husband what will i do if this happened catastrophic thinking abounds surprisingly enough i just follow the whole scenario throughwhat i would do afterwards how would i feel etc after enough times of doing this i dont feel as anxious i know what i would do and its okay i feel im prepared enough though one never really is and i can handle it with help you may want to explore this with a therapist its tough to struggle with that one thing that helped me is to focus less on how i feel and more on what i am trying to accomplish and what they might be feeling for example in walking up to a cashier i focus on paying for what i am buying and try to be thoughtful to them because they are probably tired from being on their feet all day when you focus on those two things and do your best to ignore the rest it should help you get through it easier it also helps to put yourself in the situation over and overeven if it isnt comfortable and allow yourself to make mistakes without criticizing yourself it gives you the chance to build on what isnt working each time you try hi guys does anyone have any helpful tips on coping with flight anxiety i am flying tomorrow and i am starting to get really nervous i fly regularly as i have to keep up with family its a short 3 hour flight and ive been flying for around 5 years 34 times a year i was fine in the beginning i loved my first flight but in the last year ive started to feel terrible in the plane and before the flight i was so horrified the last time we flew i cried in my boyfriends arms when we felt a bit of turbulence i tried breathing exercises and distracting myself with readingcolouring but every time i feel a bit of shaking i stop doing whatever im doing and i just start to look around and notice whats happening when the turbulence stops i continue to read and everything is fine i really want to overcome this as i feel like a complete nervous wreck ball and i hate that i dont know if ive got the strength to overcome this and if i do have it how to find it in myself and put it to good use any tips are greatly appreciated thank you hi jessharp im feeling for you hope this isnt horribly lame but sometimes i think of my finances as a video game i remember that money is not really real and it helps me hope it helps you content note mentions of depression mentions of anxiety around deathillness of others not detailed lately ive been having some good days good as in i feel like im feeling supported or ive worked through some things with my t etc but one thing ive noticed about my good days is that it often comes with the fear of crashing and returning to one of my bad days for example ill have a good day because im feeling supported by my friends even though im struggling ill think about how grateful i am for my good daybut then ill suddenly get anxious about something awful happening to my friends like illness death accidents etc then i either spend the rest of my day being anxioussad good day ruined or i continue on but now carrying the fear of crashing into a bad day again part of me feels like i shouldnt be dividing myself into good and bad days anyway but sometimes i do wish i could have one good day without fear does anyone else experience something similar how do you usually work through this fear of crashing hope this all makes sense hi a while back my dr switched me from xanax to klonopin and at first it worked really well at 5mg however i seem to have grown a tolerance in like a year and am already on 3mg per day im supposed to take 1mg at a time but usually have to take 2 to stop my panic and major anxiety sometimes i feel more wound up after taking it anyone have a similar experience should i go back to xanax after 10 years on xanax i had only increased from 5mg to 1mg i didnt build a tolerance this fast now im afraid itll be hard to go off it the older you get the less people affect i was like you a long time ago since then i feel bring it on  im a man with very powerful body so nothing bothers me but you can balance that with mace and a 38 and not be afraid of anything or anybody good luck had expectations to start the new year with motivation and control and a good routine but these past days were horrible is anyone feeling the same  sometimes i feel like giving up i hate myself yes im feeling the same way i didnt feel excited about new year eve either i guess its because of the cold weather whenever it snow i get physically sick when i smell snow in the air i didnt really care for snow when i was a toddler and by the time i was six year old i didnt really like the smell it had made sick to smell it and within a year i became absolutely terrified of snow because i moved into another city i live there before but i didnt know why i had gotten sick before but it was never as bad as it was when i was seven years old i live in a city that had containment water due to a chemical spill that had happen before i moved to a city a chemical plant had invent a bug repellent in a form of a spray that was supposed to kill bugs when sprayed on but it didnt work so a number of people had call in to complained and they did a callback on the bug spray refunding the money to all those who had bought the bug spray the chemical was transport in a truck that had some kind of accident on a road and the chemical spill out on the road and had gotten into the water the resident woke up the next morning and found ants and other insect dead and it was found later on when people started complaining that they were getting very sick so those who had become very sick all complained that had drinking water or had touch the water in someway but no one who had become sick had become suspicious of the water because it look clean and tasted normal it had never occurred to anyone that it may have been the water that had made them sick it wasnt until someone had taken a sample and found out that there was bug repellent in the water and they trace the chemical to a company who had a truck transporting the chemical somewhere else and the driver apparently wasnt aware that chemical had end in the water the company was shut down but the water is still really bad i had drink water without being informed that there had been a chemical spill i lost two years of my life being sicked i missed half the school year and i couldnt play with my friends because of how gravel ill i had become and no doctor know what was wrong with me i could still develop cancer or eventually have amnesia because i had drink contaminated water i got trapped in snow and couldnt get out of the driveway my fear of snow had intensified and now i feel claustrophobia and get physically sick i feel like i am dying and i feel trapped like i cant get out i dont want be a home but i dont want to leave my house i just want to go somewhere during the winter where it is warm all year around i was a ta in a university it was my first time being a ta i confronted an aggressive and arrogant student who disagreed with the marks i gave without giving a legitimate reason he yelled at me loudly and even hit the desk i was shocked and at a loss after the student venting anger on me i reported to the professor and department chair they had a talk with him to tell his behavior was unacceptable i also sent him several emails to accuse of him i ask lots of people online and they did give me good advice on how should i have dealt with such a student however my grievance is still unresolved i can still remember the evil look and hostile behavior of that student even though i may not see him again i feel that not only do i have hatred towards him but also unsatisfied with my weakness facing this student i should have bravely fought back and asked him to leave how should i deal with this bad experience i can only share my experience loads of times now i have been to the hospital had doctors out etc etc because i feel that im having a heart attack they have constantly said to me your hearts fine youre hearts fine if it was a heart attack wed know its just your anxiety it reasures me for a while but then i get the same fear and i know i need to stop this because its wasting valuable time of the hospital staff last year they spent a whole day doing tests on my heart for absolutely nothing hi ive lost my magic wand it was a wand i got out of a dvd elena of avilor and i cant find it anywhere it means a lot to me because well its one of my comfort items when i feel depressed or anxious i use my wand to help me calm down but it isnt on the desk and it isnt on the floor i cant find my wand anywhere and i need to find it hi yall im quite ashamed to write this but im going to do it anyway i have always been an anxious person and for the last two years i have been through a rough time however its going pretty well lately despite this since a week or 2 i suddenly got a vague fear that does affect my daily life i am constantly worried that everything around me is fake that i am in a coma or that i am dreaming that everything that happened in my life and now happens in my life has never happened and never is happening that the people i love do not even exist it sounds really crazy now i am writing this down  i do not understand where this fear suddenly comes from though i also wonder whether i actually believe in it or whether it is more of a fear itself i think it is mainly fear but i keep wondering why we are here on earth what i am doing here in the world why i look like the way i look i want to have answers to everything because i feel so unsafe in one way or another when you think about it life is very vague right we do not even know why we are here how we got here and what it would be like if life had never been possible then there was just nothing at all  how strange is that i probably think too much and too deep and sometimes i am almost afraid of becoming psychotic although i have never had psychoses every time i experience something fun i think there is no point in enjoying it because it is not real this is your experience but the people around you are not real maybe you are controlled like in a computer game or you are in a coma and this is all an illusion  i find it difficult to explain  i also do not know if there is a type of underlying depression somewhere i am afraid of death on the other hand i long for death because i want to know what happens then and i feel like i am going crazy about the concerning and anxious thoughts like i said i have had a difficult period and am now recovering from it things are finally getting better and i feel happier but now i think it does not matter how i feel because everything is fake for example i like being with people i love helping people i love but there is no point in helping people i love if these people dont even exist maybe this is a kind of derealization  depersonalization or im just going crazy i just think its a very scary idea that we do not know why we are here there is just no explanation and that makes me all think of things myself  i am now also afraid that i will never be able to enjoy life again because i am afraid that life does not exist at all in any case i will stop rattling now i wondered if anyone has any idea what this is and why i suddenly think this way and if someone recognizes it  on google i came across some recognizable experiences nevertheless i like to post my own story here thank you so much for your response i feel a bit better now i share my thoughts instead of keeping it to myself it also helps me to be with other people and have distraction but sometimes all of a sudden i feel really axious and i have these thoughts like what if all of this isnt real i will never find out whether other people are truly alive  that they are in the same room as i am right now perhaps this is a dream it sounds so silly now i am writing this but sometimes it suddenly attacks me that anxiety feeling did you also experience that so not only wanting to know why we are here but also the anxiety feeling of what if i am not really alive feels really like you are trapped or something i just cant understand life but you are right  we all dont know why we are here and probably we will never really know btw i wish you all a happy new year i know this isnt a thing but i was wondering peoples opinion on this i have social anxiey that is a definite i dont know if id call myself claustrophobic because i dont really put myself in small spaces when i am around a lot of people i start to become very uncomfortable im anxious at the idea of having to relate or talk to other people but thats not a factor here just the thought of people around me makes me anxious everything gets really loud for me i start to squirm if someone bumps into me i feel physical pain inside me i become hyper vigilant i just dont like to be around people like at all my father says hes the same way were misanthropes he says does anyone else feel this way around people im not sure if its my social anxiety or some form of claustrophobia i feel the same way i often feel an ackwardness when around too many people i seem to loose all train of thought and find it very difficult to make conversations i am too preoccupied on different things such as what they think of me why a they looking at me the way they are and how am i going to get out of this situation as for claustrophobia i do believe that there is a link between claustrophobia and social anxiety i think many people believe that claustrophobia is purely a fear of small spaces such as lifts caves and small rooms but they forget about the situation like talking to people and feeling as though you are suffocating in a situation that doesnt have to be physically confined but internally confining i was looking online and found this info about how there is in fact a link between the two causes of claustrophobia claustrophobia is actually generally considered a symptom of anxiety rather than its own anxiety disorder this is likely because most people that develop claustrophobia already have at least some type of mild anxiety take my anxiety test to find out more about your anxiety this makes some sense too because several disorders seem to be affected by or play a role in claustrophobia generalized anxiety disorder it seems that generalized anxiety disorder seems to play a role in the development of claustrophobia most likely there is some correlation between what led to a person developing the condition and what leads to the development of anxiety panic disorder when someone is in an enclosed space they become more likely to suffer from a severe panic attack chances are that the individual was at greater risk of panic attacks or panic disorder which means that they already showed at the very least a genetic predisposition tot the condition social phobia those with social phobia often experience a feeling of needing to escape as part of the condition although generally its not limited to enclosed spaces its possible that some of this fear ends up tangentially passing over to the way they feel in any small space hopefully this is helpful in someway i felt extremely distressed just reading this its very difficult for me to think about the idea of being locked away somewhere with people and i have to stay attentive 247 so i do not even leave the house i feel that there is something beyond anxiety and i like to call it social claustrophobia when i find myself in situations where i have to face this kind of thing i soon find myself losing my head and the fine line between sanity and insanity i feel like im not too far from the last option i often find myself so nervous around people that it is so common for me to lose my line of reasoning in the middle of speech or else to forget words memories sometimes i just say to the person hey i have something to tell you and i forget its really quite embarrassing i feel ridiculous over time i have forgotten so much and today my memory is so bad all i wanted was not having to go through all this i am having some serious concerns that i need to see if anyone else has experienced i have had a stressful 5 months i moved i was diagnosed with an autoimmune skin disease called hidradenitis suppurativa and fell into a pit of anxietydepression it feels as though i am stuck in a loop because i am sure many of the symptoms i feel are from my anxiety but once i latch onto a thought its like i cant let it go i have been in a relationship for 4 years and we had been living together for almost 3 years when i had to move back home due to health concerns ever since then i feel like i cant connect with people i cant feel love or connection and i feel like a monster i dont know if this is a symptom of anxiety or depression or what is happening to me but i literally cannot remember what happiness or love feels like at this point and i am so frustrated because i know that i do love these people because nothing has actually changed other than my perceptions i suppose i should also mention that i quit smoking marijuana around the time these symptoms of anxietydepression started everything in my romantic relationship and family relationships were great prior to this and i just cant understand why i suddenly cant feel anything is it because i am so focused on it is it because i really am a monster am i losing my mind am i just so stuck in my head that it will never be possible for me to get better i used to be so confident in what i wanted a career kids marriage and since this all started i have these thoughts that none of that can ever happen for me since i cant feel connection anymore i feel so bad because my boyfriend and family have been so supportive the last few months and i have just been faking a lot of my emotions just to not alarm anyone the only thing that has gotten me by is the thought that actually crazy people dont realize they are crazy so im probably not actually going crazy i should also mention that i have been unable to see a psychologist due to insurance but i also will not take any antidepressant or anti anxiety medication due to a bad allergic reaction i experienced to an antibiotic i was on for my skin i am all for natural remedies and have been wanting to try cbd oil as i have heard it has done wonders for other people and this all started after i quit smoking marijuana which i know greatly affects the limbic system where our emotions are housed has anyone else tried cbd oil or experienced what i am going though i just want my life back and i want to be able to genuinely tell my boyfriend how much i love him and my family i love them without this annoying anxiety in the back of my mind that was never there before i dont really know where to exactly put this but most of my problems see to be related to my anxiety so figured id post it here now because of my anxiety i depersonalize however yesterday at school it didnt feel like my typical depersonalizing usually i feel like im in someone elses body and someone is talking for me and my body parts arent mine yesterday i started with a rapid heart beat and my learning leader put her apple watch on my wrist cuz she has an app on there that detects your heart beat mine was 143 it eventually went down to 90 but my hands began to shake more violently through out the day when i started getting anxiety it didnt feel like how i usually feel like im surrounded by things that want to attack me it instead felt like i was being chased when i finally began to break i went into the break room to text my mom to come and get me when i was walking in the hallway i suddenly felt like i wasnt in reality it hit me like a train but i realized it didnt feel like my particular depersonalizing experience i didnt feel like i was in someone elses body everything seemed to look weird i dont know how to particularly describe it like it was distorted i began feeling as if i was in a dream and i slowly became more convinced i was dreaming i kept thinking this wasnt reality nothing was real i had a lot of trouble speaking id forget what i had just said in the middle of a sentence and completely forget what i was trying to say or was about to say when i had to go with my mom for christmas shopping before my sister got off work i felt like any mi ute my legs were going to give out and collapse i felt like i couldnt walk properly i had to hold onto my mom to make sure i was walking right i kept obsessing over my shaking hands kept checking my pulse to see if it was going up i tried not to think about it but i couldnt stop this morning it started off like yesterday but today i had something new happen no matter how many deep breaths i took i felt like my body wasnt receiving oxygen i felt as if i was legitimately suffocating i have no clue what happened so i have no clue what could have caused this you need an anxiety intervention follow and heed any advice and treatment your doc offers you at this point coz this is very serious anything to get out and about coz staying in for prolonged periods of time is downward slide to a depressive hell i literally drag myself out of the bed for 1 hour walks in the sun everyday am action that goes against every fiber of my body which is screaming stay inside even if youre miserable just stay inside the world outside is scary and on and on my inner voice goes but i do it anyways and i always feel better after my walks i feel sane centered and that voice never really goes away it goes along with me for walks and is constantly screaming turn back go homemy point is we gotta do what we know is healthy and essential to keep us sane youre anxiety is obviously higher than mine so get every help from your doctor you can use benzos for temporarily getting you out of the house coz the rewards outweighs the cons in this case since my father abandoned us to cause mum severe anxiety a whole bunch of responsibility fell on me to stay strong and supportive to her and my little sister it triggered some anxiety even in me and find it difficult coping until my partner comes home from seeing a client occasionally i get stressed but nullify that by a good work out in our home gym but our mum continues suffering im taking my personal anxiety on a onedayatatime basis funny but as soon i get onstage to perform i become a wholly different person and the anxiety though can morph into stage fright just melts away the evenings at home can be difficult though i feel much better after eating dinner i had a bullying former manager who did a number on my self esteem confidence and mental health ever since getting canned i still feel i cant trust my new employer even though he has told me no one is going to do such things i think its because the former employer used to be nice and then she became progressively rude and nasty i could not talk to her as everything i said was dismissed pretty much i had a meltdown in my new bosses office because i thought he was going to fire me i did something wrong but since its probation they can sack you for any reason he said i need to talk to you and i felt sick and wanted to cry cried in his office and shook like a leaf he called me down and said he just wanted to do a thirty day eval and discuss what happened yesterday i feel like an idiot for doing this but it is scary for me my former employer would say i need to talk to you and i would hide for the day because it would be another ruinous everything is your fault and i wonder if you are learning disabled since you dont get it i nearly threw up because she said i need to talk to you i thought she was going fire me there ever since just heating those words sets me off i thought about asking my new boss i do like him he said i was hired for a reason and that everyone is glad to have me aboard if he could just explain he needs to talk to me but say i need to go over your eval or i just need to go over this in the office with you instead of i need to talk to you i kind of feel like thats asking too much but i dont want to have a panic attack in his office over nothing or at all thanks hi yes i do know this feeling i am unsure if this is related to anxiety low self esteem depression or a combination of all three but when im with friends or even talking to friends i feel that i am forcing them to do so because they are good people and just want to be nice im always asking them that they dont need to talk to me if they dont want to or i say that im not worth liking or worth anything they tell me i am all i can really say is to try to tell yourself that your friends do like you if they didnt why would they still be your friends think of all the things youve done together i know this is easier said than done as i struggle with this too i read your other thread and the stuff with your husband would drive me nuts i feel for you as for the panic attack i know how much they suck glad you were able to get through it oh smallnorth  i am so so familiar with this ive had two very similar episodes of suspected cancers that turned out to be nothing tests professional speculation preparation waiting andnothing then months and months of being on edge i really hope other people chime in here because there are a lot of directions this incident can take you now some people do get over it eventually and things do return to normal but these types of things shake our very foundations and a lot of us have our brains rewired after something like this life doesnt feel so safe anymore and part of the everyday anxiety is this vague feeling that anything at any moment can pop up and throw our lives back into chaos i hope i am not making this worse im trying to get the point across that sometimes these things do awaken a dormant disorder in us and it takes more than just time to heal i dont know what the next logical step will be for you but i feel like there should be more dialogue now between you and a counselor or therapist or whomever you can manage to talk with in this field i spent many years believing that sooner or later i would go back to normal so i didnt do anything about what was becoming a growing problem with anxiety i am doing better now with some various forms of therapy but i could have saved a number of years if i recognized this earlier good luck i really hope this doesnt sound catastrophic there is hope i promise resumed from anxiety daily checkin point 3  page 2  forums at psych central im feeling anxiety and i really need relief i guess i could have a cogentin when i think about my therapist i feel anxious i miss her i didnt see her this week maybe thats why also since this is a therapy service offered by my university when ill finish uni and that is soon on february ill have to stop seeing her i think so this hurt me a bit because i think ill miss her even more i wish i could stay more plus i feel the same problems are with me everyday i need therapy did two loads of laundry and got my hair done im always anxious when i go to the hairdresser because my husband doesnt go in with me i trust the stylist enough so i dont panic but i feel uncomfortable i just want to say im grateful for all the brief check ins lately ive been very down and anxious and this thread is one of my safe places i feel comforted just knowing thee are others struggling like me i hope the best for you all where to start i am worried i am anxious i am depressed i am frazzled i am dissapointed resentful and agnry is the lithium withdrawal contributing i am irritable easily aggrivated and annoyed yes i have numerous very significant stressors in my life only one of which is my physical health to work me up these things if disclosed would be obviously extremely concerning to onlookers except apparently to my boyfriend i am quite sure others would acknowledge these situations and even validate my worry is understandable and expected despite the added situation of tapering off my lithium as adding to it all i think i am managing well i doubt even the average person would be able to cope i am hanging on i feel by a thread had to go to the supermarket to pick up some food for the next couple of days i was fine until i got there i spent thirty minuets in the van and then another twenty minuets standing beside the drink machines before i could go in side went to the bathroom to calm down about half way through the trip and then finished up i tend to eat when im stressed and i ate too many potato wedges i feel like such a fatty surprisingly i feeling pretty good today last night was kind of a mess but today im pretty calm did well the past few nights because i was with my friend but im back home and unable to sleep again texted my local helpline and talked to a very sweet girl and i feel better though still have a headache bless the volunteers there especially the late night ones i appreciate it so much that there are people willing to spend their 2 am counseling people for free im really struggling today im seeing my therapist for the first time after the holidays in an hour and im feeling so anxious the past 3 days were especially tough ive been constantly using selfdestructive behaviors because i can not cope with feeling like this but the truth is i only made things worse im trying to keep calm and take care of myself but i feel like im going to break down at any minute i just took 05 mg of lorazepam and im having a glass of warm milk i need to pull myself together quickly my anxiety has really been taking over the last few monthssaw new p yesterday  have restarted my buspar  will continue my propranolol im glad that i feel strong enough to start fighting it again instead of letting it continue to control my life i hate talking on the phone as well my anxiety goes up everytime a family member calls me unexpectedly i wind up having to call them back because then i feel like i can handle it better same as thesadgirl i cannot do stuff like ordering pizza so i always order it online could it be that the avitan actually has helped and is just kicking in i felt miserable around an hour ago cast good sense into the wind took one and now i feel almost as good as a kpin could make me although i possibly have more anxiety now or maybe the anxiety just wasnt helped by this pill i dont know what to say now whatever it is its maybe 5 to 10 of what a kpin could do for me im not doing so well lately im trying to keep myself busy during the day and ive accomplished a few tasks i feel proud of this week but im finding it extremely hard not to isolate myself i get so anxious when im around people and i dont even want to talk with my friends it takes me several days to text them back and i spend hours thinking about the fact that i need to text them even if i dont which only makes me more anxious my friend insisted on picking me up after therapy this evening i have a difficult session coming and i wanted to be alone and clear up my mind but shes going to be busy these days and she tried to make some time for me so i couldnt say no plus i cancelled going out for dinner with her the other day because it felt like a huge challenge i felt better after cancelling it but now i feel like im being ungreatful its gonna be long day and im really anxious about the appointment with my therapist i wanted to be home early today but it seems like its not gonna happen i have to be really careful with my anxiety leves at night time so i only hope i can manage to end the day in a good way now im just trying to keep myself busy so i dont think about it too much i felt blue and super anxious earlier but after a nap i feel a little better had a pretty alright day i was able to eat in fact i think i overate nowim feeling the consequences with heartburn on top of my normal anxiety stomach aches before bed but trying to stay calm since the stomach aches trigger the anxiety a lot gonna try not to bother anybody about it tonight not my friends not my mom not the hopeline and just meditate or something ive been extremely anxious since yesterday i feel like im choking shaking and about to vomit any second i wish i could unexist until this passes its 9 am right now where i am im waiting for a reasonable hour to call my doctor ive been on sertraline for 2 weeks and this is the first time ive felt so bad since i started using it i feel terrified i got reasons to worry like everyone does but i feel i wont be able to handle them anymore i feel overwhelmed by responsibilities and uncertainties this may sound stupid but my anxiety elevated because of the kittens in out buildings yard ive been feeding them getting them spayed looking after them for a few days at home and then putting them back to the yard this was going smoothly until the cats made a habit of entering the building and pooping whenever they cant find a way out the janitor took them and left them somewhere unsafe in a moment of rage before but i was able to bring them back and inform the neighbors so that they wont let the cats inside but still some people invite them in and the same thing happens last night the janitor came and complained and demanded that id do something about it i think i handled it pretty well i offered to put cat litter somewhere in case they are trapped inside the apartment the janitor accepted my offer but still i feel like they are gonna be taken any moment and i wont be able to help them didnt do much today besides walking outside i feel a bit uncomfortable that im feeling hot and i know that is because of stress and tomorrow is my birthday threw up last night so i missed my friends birthday dont know from what but i feel fine now had a bad panic episode about it thinking it had to be an allergic reaction but i dont think it was really want to go to my friends house tomorrow but im afraid of being contagious to her still after 2 days my sister caught what i had and threw up too so i dont know i went out although its cold i swear i didnt know where i was walking i was just looking at my feet i didnt look at any one in the face now i feel worse than before i went out picked up most of my meds today two wont be available until next week but i should be okay wrote a poem about it had a temporary crown put in this afternoon will get the permanent one in a week and a half felt like the dentist was going to drill all day thank goodness i was numbed up right now im resting kids are making dinner tonight thats cool i am having problems staying in my home office i dont know why im feeling anxious in there that sounds good i was nervous bringing it up last night but i confronted my brother about one of his strange rules that he put in place a few years back that i feel is a violation of my rights i also dropped the i with him and called ourselves we because it the truth and im tired of hiding it i dont care anymore if he doesnt want to hear it or shakes his head about it as though it makes no sense im the sufferer and have a right to refer to myselves as we are after all these decades its finally coming out im becoming assertive and you know what i like it it doesnt just feel good it feels right i agree with you i feel really shaky inside and im restless which is often one of the signs that im really anxious but it isnt something stupid im just really worried i feel like i have a molten ball of wax in my a gut and im very twitchy today i cant even point to any one reason why i feel this way today its not like i have to go anywhere or be around people about the only thing i am worried about is going to my support group tomorrow night 1 i dont much enjoy it since the dynamic has changed 2 it is in a not very nice part of town and i hate coming fromtowaiting for the bus the stop is midway between a hooker stroll and a shelter in the dark 3 it is effing cold out 4 i am not one of the popular crowd at the meeting listening to the incrowd discuss what they have done the previous week together and making plans for the following is not only hurtful but downright rude i feel so bad about myself at these meetings they arent any longer the most supportive so why do i go i go there because someone has to be supportive to the rest of the unpopular crowd i feel as though i am needed some of them turn to me for some sense of leadership not anxious this morning because i just woke up every morning i am hopeful that ill be productive and then it almost never happens and i get anxious and sometimes have panic attacks i feel good about today though mri went fine my head was actually sticking out the other end of the tube so i wasnt as nervous as i thought i would be today was mostly spent in bed i woke up really late i did some work on my web site and have two plugins done the third may have to wait until i have more money i had to drop off my daughters wallet at her work and ended up buying some clothes that i did need no anxiety today because of the running around i feel better waiting to see how tomorrow ends up im feeling a ton of anxiety today and yesterday hell ive been feeling it for weeks i come up with these worse case scenarios and feel like my life is going to fall apart at any moment i am really depressed and anxious right now why cant i get out of the house and to my appointments and social events i feel like a loser slight anxiety today had a big argument with a family member yesterday i dont know quite how i feela lot of emotions going on i need a small break to process this but need to do it without them feeling unloved i have so much to do today but cannot

someone but dont know where to go im really scared a few days ago i try and went to the store after a while and that was good im feeling a bit anxious my pharmacy called and my meds are ready but i need to call back because i need to change the quantity because the price is a bit high no anxiety this morning even though i have a full day i feel optimistic about today ive been reading posts here but havent posted but i am feeling anxious  constant butterflies  for over 2 weeks i dont really know why or maybe i do its all kinda muddled i emailed my t to say im feeling anxious she suggested to make a list of things causing it a good idea and now all my reasons seem stupid the anxiety is distracting me from getting my work done having a panic attack this morning anxiety level really high i feel unable to handle anything and like im falling into a pit with no way out cant seem to help myself up i also feel really bad that this keeps happeninglike im letting people down im feeling relief because everything with college got straightened out im a little anxious about tomorrow im going several places and have to take the bus a few times the last place i am going i have never taken a bus to or from before so thats a bit nerve wracking but it should be a good day doing really good today i feel hopeful energetic and optimistic i think today will be a great day after weeks of anxiety that was no more than a small blip on the radar i find myself today with it quite elevated i am concerned about a woman who keeps hitting cars during her attempts to park i feel the need to be vigilantly watching out the window so as to run down with a note to leave on the other cars should she do so yet again three times in a day and a half i also need to call my optometrists office to obtain my information so as i can order my eyeglasses elsewhere i am afraid of a confrontation went to church made dinner did a load of laundry updated some software made the bed worked on photos the

on edge i need to get going home so i can stop at the pharmacy and refill my prns i got the horrible news that im supposed to be here the rest of my life i guess my anxiety is way up but i feel very numb nobody in my family other than my grandma got me so much as a card for my birthday not that i need presents but some kind of acknowledgement or something would be nice especially when my sisters get so much i feel like im being a brat but it really hurt my feelings i keep fighting off tears oki really dread my anxiety disorder nobody needs to feel sorry for meit just helps me to get it off my chest i get this paralyzing anxiety before every vacation and every holidayreally before any big change i hate this with a passion i work on it in therapy i use my coping techniques and yet it remains i am so paralyzed i cant get off the recliner and im leaving tomorrow and i have to get my drivers license renewed it might as well be traveling to the moon for as capable as i feel anyway thanks for letting me get some of it out its an added pressure on my daughter and thats not fair to her i wish i felt nothing sometimes being too sensitive and emotional is the pits i need to calm down take a deep breath do my daily calm meditation make a reasonable plan and be gentle and compassionate with myself beating myself up for this wont help anything just remain calmtake deep breaths my anxiety has been extremely high lately ive been searching for a full time job for months and have posted extensively on that in other areas so ill skip the details for now last friday i was contacted about a job that i had figured i was passed over for and they let me know that theres another opening and they are seriously considering me i feel like i practically have the job they wanted to start a background check and contact my references nothing there that will change their minds so now im just waiting for an offer and its killing me its now wednesday so the background check should be done i assume theyve made contact with most if not all of my references and still i havent heard anything im not overly excited about the job itself but i really need something full time and its so exciting to possibly finally get a break i just wish they would call or email me and let me know whats going on the other part thats making my anxiety so bad is trying to figure out the timing of everything my current job has no delay in payment so once i quit i wont have a last paycheck a few weeks later to rely on for bills i could potentially go a full month with no income before i get paid at the new job and thats tearing me apart i really cant figure out any way to time it so that i wont have so much time without income and i dont know what i can do to make it through that time im hoping that worst case i can borrow money from my parents theyve been helping me pay my rent for the past few months so maybe this could be a last time rent payment that i can use for other bills since the next month they wont be giving me money for rent i dont know yet im not getting any information and its driving me crazy i have someone in my life that has an anger management problem they can be and frequently are vicious hostile and aggressive they do usually refrain from throwing things but they have been known to follow people home who cut them off in traffic and harass them lots of yelling with this person everyone else takes it in stride now im no shrinking violet i can shut people down with the best of them and im fairly good at hand to hand combat thank you taekwondo there is no danger to me other then the fact that i am sensitive and peaceful and find it beyond acceptable or pleasant i also dont want my child around it either i have to go to a funeral with this person tomorrow and spend time with them afterwards my anxiety has ratcheted way up and ive had one panic attack already for which i broke out the valium i will talk to my therapist about this when i see her after christmas i wanted to see if anyone had any advice or insight on how i can just chill out i feel utterly ridiculous everyone else is ok the problem is me whats up with the panic attacks my dad was exactly this way triggering me maybe thanks much for any input cant keep attention focused on anything for more than a minute grinding my teeth and tensing up just by looking at shopping sites online worse is that im blaming myself for being like this anxiety is a pretty new thing for me 4 years or so compared to the other diagnosis i have i feel like i dont have a clue in how to deal with itlive with it im feeling nervous my stomach is in a knot over getting blood work ive have had blood work a ton of times i dont get why i am so nervous its also not helping that im hungry but cant eat until after the blood work and of course with my rotten luck i woke up very early woke up okay today but palms are sweaty asf for no reason i have class today so i wasnt ready but after eating breakfast and getting ready im feeling a bit better this is so stressful even with an amazing realtor to help me i feel so overwhelmed i think i should crawl back under my rock where i belong i dont deserve happiness my sister is pushing me to stay with it at least this is definitely my fault i hate being like this so damn fragile im feeling awful right now i have to go in to my new job that is very stressful plus i have to work with a new colleague i havent met before im so bad at dealing with these unknowables ugh i just want to disappear i would be so grateful if someone would write me some encourageable words why do my legs always feel like theyre going to give out on me and why can i feel air going through them once i feel this sensation the panic sets in and the attack begins i am very sensitive to noise and unnatural lighting both cause immediate nervous reaction i literally jump when i hear a sudden noise be it someones laughter a door closing that is why i have such a difficult time at work i have to deal with constant noise and very strong florescent lights i strongly dislike it to a point hate would be the appropriate word to use to describe how i feel hello all hope youre well im really struggling with anxiety currently what ive discovered is i think that its the physical sensation of fear which compels me to engage in compulsions i took a small dose of clonazepam this morning about 30 mins later in noticed that i was calm mentally i was actually taken aback as it had been about 5 mins and i wasnt pacing around tending to my various concerns as i usually would be i thought about this trying to look beyond the well of course im calm im on a tranquilizer and what i came up with was this the reason i was relatively calm and not engaging in my ritualistic checking and mirror gazing etc was because the physical sensation of anxiety wasnt there cognitively the anxious thoughts and intrusive thoughts were still happening its just they had lost their meaning or moreover they werent causing me the physical sensation of anxiety the physical sensation of anxiety for me is sometimes indistinguishable from physical pain its so severe that id do anything to get rid of it however in its abscence i was able to mindfully label certain thoughts as anxiety or anxious thinking and redirect my attention onto something else normally i would struggle or cave in and engage in safety behaviours including avoidance but without the physical component the intrusive thoughts didnt have the same powerful influence they usually do so in my treatments i have learnt about distress tolerance since this discovery of mine this morning i can see just how important distress tolerance is its the ability to sit with that pain the physical terror and not run away from it or try and repair or tidy it away etc its incredibly difficult as your natural inclanation is to recoil from it and make it go away ive made serious efforts in the past to tolerate it and it does eventually pass and over time you learn to not give that physical sensation the credence you normally do however in the past i had a lot of support from mental health professionals and currently i dont have any im totally on my own against a myriad of anxiety disorders and now ive been told i may have personality disorders too how do you tolerate that anxiety when its so against your natural inclination i know compassion plays a key role as you have to care for yourself to want to put yourself through suffering in order to attain a positive outcome for yourself however i really struggle with being compassionate to myself i feel like the world is caving in on me when that physical anxiety hits for instance when challenging my ocd and touching things i really dont want to  its nightmarish yet i can sometimes bear it and not try and supress what im feeling just sit there with the anxiety and reengage in something else thus learning that the feeling doesnt mean anything is true or not true  its just a feeling i just am too fragile at the moment to sit with that fear i have too much selfhate to be compassionate to myself this is more to do with my potential personality disorders from what ive been told as a result of being unable to face my fears i am slipping backwards at an alarming rate ive become housebound due to my bdd im engaging in compulsions more than i am doing anything else i dont know how to get myself back on track i need some therapy but i cant afford privately and the nhs in the uk is not able to keep up with the demand for therapy  so i wont be getting any more therapy for a year at least according to my mental health team any tips for distress tolerance i know a bit about compassion and soothing the threat system with soothing rhythmic breathing etc but im too busy running away from my anxiety to even think about tackling my issues i know i cant get better without facing my issues but im really terrified the whole time and only have escapism or abiding the rulescompulsions to keep myself away from the hurt interested to hear your thoughts c5 anxiety is something i struggle with im an older person and it seems like the older i get the worse my anxiety gets i dont see a therapist nor am i on any kind of medication for anxiety or anything else for that matter things that help me to keep my anxiety level down include keeping myself occupied mostly doing household chores im retired  im also pretty reclusive so i have a lot of time on my hands i also do about an hourahalf of mindfulness yoga most days and i have a small dog i take for walks a couple of times a day regardless of the weather we live in a townhome  have no yard so daily walks are imperative i also spend quite a bit of time here on pc all of these things put together help me to keep my level of anxiety down to a dull roar as they used to say one other thing ill just mention is that personally i feel its important to maintain a peaceful calm environment i avoid watching any kind of violent tv or movies i dont watch the news on tv and when i listen to music its mostly of the quiet calming variety i was feeling like the walls were closing in last night think its because of christmas fast approaching this time of year seems to cause my anxiety to spike  has in the past also triggered depressive episodes i have no explanation for why this may be the case today i feel kind of on edge or agitated not in an irritated with people way butfor example my jeans were creasing  touching my leg in a way that was irritating me  the arms of my tshirt were doing the same i had to go  change  im ok now but i can feel my breathing isnt right im too aware of it i think thats anxiety starting to creep in again i know where this is going  i feel powerless to stop it i know when they all come home there will be noise  theyre not doing anything wrong just family coming home from work  school but its like an assault on my senses  i just want to shut myself in my room  hide  cover my ears and they all think im being moody  then the arguments start and they say nasty words and im not crazy im not doing this on purpose i just get overwhelmed but they dont understand ive tried to explain it ive tried to explain the best i can what its like in my head but you need to be in it to understand i just need a bit of space  i dont mean to shut them out but isolating myself is the only way i know to stop the feelings drowning me i understand how you feel when i feel uncomfortable in my own clothes i know there is a problem personal space is a big factor in decreasing anxiety for some of us when were constantly surrounded by people sometimes we feel like were suffocating have you considered how much personal space you need and how much alone time you need for example i only want to be around people for less than 2 hours a day im not afraid of people and i very good socially if i need to be  but people annoy me after 2 hours especially since the holidays are here we can get sick of being in this merrygoround of annoying holidaythemed gatherings thank you both for taking the time to reply i wasnt in a good place when i posted  your replies really helped im not currently on any medication but i am getting to the point where i feel i need to go back to my gp  explain how heightened my anxiety seems to get at this time of year and yes  thats exactly the feeling  suffocated by people  thats exactly how it feels  i have to get out of the situation thank you again i am really not sure where to put this there doesnt seem to be a good place for it so i hope this is okay 20 months ago and for about 6 years before that i had to donate plasma to survive i could just barely get by but i also needed to juggle maxed out credit cards when bigger issues came up i was on a financial tight wire and frankly if my good luck hadnt happened 20 months ago i would be homeless and bankrupt by now so i feel bad asking this but it is bringing up new things that trigger my old crap and is hard to deal with i say good because it only came about because my mental health severely deteriorated i am now in a position that i can buy a very modest home in an area with a very reasonable real estate market this is freaking me out i feel unworthy which i am of course it is the smart thing to do since rents are increasing really fast so my fixed income actually shrinks every year colas simply dont keep up plus owning a home is a good investment and my mortgage payment will likely be less than my rent even though the house will be significantly nicer i even get my property taxes waived so i dont really have to worry about any significant increasing costs even electricity to dirtcheap here i am looking at building a house that comes with warranties and other assurances it is the wise move all around i am cycling through many emotions from fear to absolute terror to give a little idea about it i have never been excited about buying a car even though i knew it was going to be easy to pay off i dislike any kind of debt even the good debt of a home loan doesnt make sense since i will have more extra money with lower monthly payments i have been talking with an agent for two weeks over email and am meeting her tomorrow which is absolutely terrifying i am the type to use selfcheckout so i dont have to talk to anyone she seems quite nice and has closed a lot of va loans so is used to dealing with us whiny stubborn and issuefilled vets she is even kind enough to share 20 of her commission with me which is amazing to me the idea of meeting her is terrifying i understand completely it is a business thing but women usually look at me and run away talking to strangers is not exactly my forte especially women i have never gone through this process but am reading up as much as i can but it is still confusing it feels like i am entering a pitch black tunnel with lots of traps maybe it would be easier if i had a spouse to lean on i dont want to lay all my crazy on whoever reads this but i am even stressed and upset about the idea of having a neighbor or two that like to be overly social  defined as more than a hello once a month i live in a complex and have lived next to for at least 5 years and i dont even know their names and i doubt i have spoken a complete sentence to them ever i really like that so i have my usual selfloathing actually seething hatred and unbreakable belief that i deserve nothing good to deal with but there is even a little excitement fear social anxiety and whatever else involved with all which is new also i dont know if i have an exact question but if you can relate and give any advice it would be appreciated i know some may want to ask how someone like me could be well enough to sign mortgage papers i dont know how but i guess i am i suffer from panic attacks on a daily basis im now at the point of vomiting through out the day i cant go on like this ive tried so many meds but nothing helps i feel like im going to die and no one can help me the last couple days i have been having this feeling of depersonalization it lasts for maybe ten minutes a time and i feel super strange during it it occurs 3 times per days since it started i was reading online about it and i do not think it has developed into full blown depersonalization disorder but it does bother me i feel like im disconnected from my brain and body i recently had my dosage of risperidone lowered and seroquel was added to my prescriptions about a week and a half ago so i was wondering if my heightened anxiety is a result of the seroquel kicking in or a combination of my risperidone being lowered as well as the seroquel my anxiety has been getting worse and my next psychiatrist appointment is in ten days has anyone else dealt with anything similar to this thanks i knew that my teeth in the upper back were a bit used since the paste is old and i havent have gone to the dentist in years i have noticed while eating certain things that were hard were a bit discomfort but no pain and just now i was eating pizza and one of my teeth came out all of the sudden i feel scared and sort of anxious because im 29 i dont know if thats normal hi guys i think ill create a separate thread instead of bumping my old one but you can find it here long story short basically i am an anxious person with current health anixiety that dramatically increased with the death of my mother i have gone through multiple fears of different diseases and at some point i started thinking what if what i have is a schiz and my hypochondriac fears are delusions ever since then i was super scared of schiz it took me a lot of googling to figure it out but i had a basic understanding of what i have and why my condition is at least questionable to call schiz ive read a lot of articles and posted on a lot of fourms until i found one where i consulted with a supposed certified specialist it was online so who knows how professional he is who told me that i definitely just have anixiety so whatever right i kinda calmed down later on few weeks ago i learned that my biological father with whom i dont live was diagnosed with f20 schiz he was diagnosed around the age of 43 plus minus so now i am super afraid of inheriting the disease and talking to that doctor guy ive figured that what ive had were definitely not delusions since in the condition the believes are so severe that people are given the medicine to get rid of them which i definitely dont need there are other ways to convince me i was wrong after i told that doc guy yeah thanks i feel better about delusions now he said that i am in the hypochondrical cycle and that i will soon find something else to worry about and there it goes literally the next day i first started thinking of unusual believes and then started suspecting i was hearing voices 4 days ago i was 100 sure that ive had no voices over the last 3 days ive had 2 incidences both of which could be explained by something else since i was not completely alone i work retail and the day before yesterday when closing and looking if everyone left in the supposedly empty of customers store for a second i thought ive heard voices somewhere far away like some sort of murmur and it felt like ah what was thatlike when you though you heard something for a sec but unsure what was that but i was super tired after an 8 hour shift and there was lots of noise in the building such as conditioner radio animals screaming i work at petco and it later turned out that there were janitors in the building who maybe were talking to each other and later on i tested and it turned out that i could recreate the exact same sound in my head and stop it whenever i want by another thought or by starting doing something else and thinking about it so maybe it even was myself thinking of what to look imagining it and getting scared of my own imagination for a second since i was super tired and not thinking straight the second case was yesterday and it would be also possible to explained by something else i was ringing the person up and ive heard someone say st right by my ear like not addressing me but like if someone said it to themselves the sound was coming from outside and was not inside of my head and it was coming from the direction of a person standing by me and there were 2 more people within my hand reach who couldve said it i did ask my coworker about it later on and looked very stupid btw but he said he heard nothing but also he maybe didnt even get what i was talking about or he maybe wasnt paying attention whatever so that could be explained by assuming that some of the people that stood close to me had said it and from what i understood its more common for schizophrenics to hear voices inside their head so what i wanted to know is if there is no clear evidence that there is a voice in my head and what i hear could be explained by something else i shouldnt yet be bothered by it right or at least not assume that what i have are the voices meaning if i was sitting alone and had a voice is one thing but another is when there is at least semireasonable explanation right how do people feel their voices also there is a thing of me now expecting a voice to pop up at some point and i am super afraid thanks ive been trying to look for a specialist but received no responses yet dont hesitate to seek help from a dr as weird as you feel and think they will think im crazy in all reality we are very sane compared to most i work in le and trust me i see it all the time and i feel your struggle with the whole work thing ok so ive had issues with anxitey and depression my whole life im 23 and recently switched to lexapro 20 mgs after being on prozac for a few years ive been having intrusive thoughts lately that are scaring me and making me feel like im crazy i know i wouldnt act on them but in the moment they pass thru my mind and my body tingles and i go into panic could this be from the meds im not suicidal but i have thoughts about it never could bring myself to doing it but it feels like nothing is helping i feel like im going to just snap and wake up a psycho one day does anyone else feel this ever or have experience with it im afraid to take xanax im prescribed because i see things about hallucination which is a big feari feel like im going to just randomly hallucinate as it is i know it sounds dumb but this is the place i feel comfortable asking for help my unexpected panic attacks stopped some time ago but about 3 weeks ago they came back and ive had 5 in these 3 weeks and its awful i feel really bad and so anxious during them i wish they would stop now im not afraid of them as i know they are random and i have accepted this fact but i really dont like them and want them to go away again im sorry to hear about your panic attacks i have struggled with anxiety but not as much now my anxiety is like a rollercoaster one moment ill feel okay then the next moment i feel anxious it sucks but i hope to one day overcome the anxiety that i feel one thing that i have done is accepting that my brain and mind are wired differently some people are wired differently not everyone is equipped to deal with anxiety effectively thats why some people need therapy and help others can have anxiety and they can do something and it just disappears i think talking to a counselor doctor or healthcare worker will help you the best they can try to figure out why you keep having panic attacks do your panic attacks come from any worries disturbing or intrusive thoughts try to figure out what is causing them i wish the best for you in life and i hope you find a way to overcome your panic attacks i started out in science i have a bachelors degree in the field of geology which was active 10 years prior i decided to have a bit more fun in college and duel majored learning sculpture which i already know was stupid and worthless i then went on to graduate school in geologyabout the time that many of the science divisions in the united states shut down i ended up leaving after a personal conflict with my major advisor as she was very against religion and was notorious for creating conflict with students who suggested any religious ties period this was not something that i knew prior to going to school and while exiting the program the head of the department accidentally let it slip that this particular professor was known to have chased away postdoctorate students she was extremely difficult to deal with instead of going back to graduate school with two other offers from different universities that would have taken me in if i applied i decided to go for something different i pursued animation at a top private college and obtained my masters degree i faced a lot of discrimination there because it was filled with very rich students from very prestigious backgrounds i even put myself into the hospital trying to keep up with them by spending 3 to 4 days awake and sleeping an hour here and there to prove my worth i ended graduating with nearly all as it was a hard road because art is quite subjective and the stereotypical belief is that nothing is quite good enough many of the professors are equally hard on their own work and often judge students to years of people out in the profession well needless to say when i graduated i couldnt find a job anywhere i did here back from a few casino companies that were interested in my art they liked it until upper management and thats when i got turned down nothing in science absolutely zero i gave nearly ten years of my life trying to make a life for myself and now i am a parttime cashier at a local store in the middle of nowhere i have taken enough courses that i only need about 6 more before i can go back to school for premed and all the ones that ive taken thus far that count have been stellar grades but honestly im tired im so very tired all my younger siblings are married or in a relationship they all have decent paying jobs with and without education they take vacations and buy things they like im 28 and eating canned soup and 1 sandwiches from mcdonalds to stay alive i live with family because i cant afford anything much more on my own i have more degrees than anyone in my family has ever had and nothing works im good with books my employer told me personally that im a damn hard worker as did all my parttime employers in the past i can probably get handfuls of recommendations from them but i feel alone and worthless and worse i get treated like im worthless too customers often times come up and throw things on the counter and if i cant answer something they instigate a conversation about my lack of intelligence dont get me wrong there are so many nice people too but when the mean ones come they are downright ugly ive found myself going out of my way at the dollar store or grocery store for a cashier because i know what its like personally these arent stupid people they are just people so down on their luck that they dont know how to get out i understand 100 my family keeps telling me that im not trying hard enough that i somehow havent really pushed myself into finding a real job i havent made a decision without them as they control everything i even call them up when i want to spend my earned money to eat a subway or somewhere fancy like that i feel guilty about spending money needlessly on myself as i keep thinking that ill need it one day its developed anxiety in my life that i cant control everyone outside my family thinks that im a very happy because i dont take my problems to work or outside i wear the brightest smile i possible can hell i bet you at this point you can call me whatever you need to and i wont crack in front of you but it burns deep and i take my failures home with me every night it interrupts my sleep with nightmares and causes me to constantly worry about everything i do if nothing else ive become rather good at pretending that im not me any longer sometimes i look in the mirror and i cant really see me anymore i cant even do things that i enjoy anymore because i feel its all worthless i found that i like daydreaming more than anything else i like not thinking about my life or how im running out of money i like pretending that maybe in a parallel universe or what ever nonsense i have a normal life and a family about now hell i even pretend sometimes im pretty too it gets sadder and of course im consciences enough to understand that im really the me in any of my daydreams thats being either frivolous or downright illogical but i must be worth something somehow sorry for my bad english i dont know which forum to post this so i decided to do it here i am a 23 year old boy who have had suicidal thoughts for about 6 months now i have always had low self esteem but it have just gotten worse and worse the last couple of years because of some bad choices i have made it started 34 years ago where i would go on online webcam sites and masturbating in front of people i was often high or drunk while i did this and i think i did it to fill out the emptiness in my life i did it a lot for over a year but then i found a girlfriend and stopped getting high 18 months ago i suddenly got very paranoid because i thought someone could have recorded me and put it up online it turns out i was right after searchin some time i found some videos of me masturbating with face and everything since then i have been depressed and cant move on i feel ashamed and gross i feel that people will judge me and think im a pervert my friends says nobody will find the videos and that nobody cares i feel like this will never go away because it may belong to the past but to me it also belongs to the present because those videos are online and and will never go away i dont wanna go outside because i am afraid someone will regonize me from those videos i just cant live like this my girlfriend left me because she cant handle my suicide thoughts anymore she was all i got i loved her so much she was the only person who really understood me but now she is taken distance from me to make her own life better i love her and i am happy that she is happy but this is so hard and i think she has found a new guy the only person i could talk to and i felt loved me for who i am dont want to talk to me anymore i have tried different psychiatrists but nothing helps my thoughts becomes darker and darker and i feel more and more lonely i cant get over what i have done and i am so afraid someone will find it all the time i just want it all to go away i wish i never went on webcam but now i see no way out of this i just want to die and stop the pain please help my agoraphobia has been on the back burner this year because i was locked up in the hospital for over two months then locked in this nursing home for 5 months but im feeling it a little more just recently because im supposed to be going to doctors appointments this coming week i do not want to go unless i understand how im going to get there and back and a host of other worries this is all chained together by free floating anxiety and rebound anxiety from when i was coming off benzos i didnt leave my apartment for anything at all for over a whole 12 months in 20142015 i didnt go out for the mail or anything at all my friend would visit every few weeks and bring my mail in etc i was fine i felt comfortable but the telemed companies stopped giving me refills of meds so i finally had to go to the horrible clinic i hope everyone is free im still locked up lol hello i noticed that i am unable to determine the right way of action when encountering negative conflict with others example would be whether someone yells at me due to my fault or my lack of efficacy to perform certain task or even when i am not to blame at all especially experiencing how someone yells at me or calls me names without knowing me well leaves me at a loss feeling vulnerable and lose selfesteem because i feel i could fight back to defend my respect as a person something does not let me respond with same negativity or respond physically after situation is over i keep replaying that scenario from memory and think how i would respond which usually yell back or grab offender by throat and threaten him i can forget about whole thing next morning but it seems that i have developed anxiety and panic attacks due to these events as they happened in my life and now it is in my subconscious mind if conflict happened at local shop next time that i plan going there i already start feeling uneasy and anxious when i get out of my house i mostly feel tense and cannot be as comfortable as i am at home is anyone here who experiences this how do you cope in such situations it seems these situations are the root cause that affected my selfesteem and confidence thanks i do a great deal of rehashing negative social situations in my own mind too one of the things i do though is follow my own advice to them namely calm down i then try to reconsidered what transpired through the others points of view what perhaps was their own leadup to the situation and how might have they been triggered what could i have done differently only then will i if i feel it necessary or a point to make doing so will i respond email tends to be my preferred choice of communication in such cases but you know whats the worst when you cannot concentrate at the task at hand being in a panic attack and unable to remain calm example scenario when paying small change to cashier while being in such a state due to some jerk you feel as the anxiety and panic build up because you also delay others in line you reach a drained state where you feel the anger of everyone and think what they would think of you being unable to handle such a simple task that involves elementary math being unable to resonate on your level they are now deeming you as a stupid retard i had those moments in life and they really affected my sense of selfesteem and confidence levels on a subconscious level since early years with every such situation i start thinking of future and being unable to handle such such situation as i wish what will happen i dont have girlfriend but what would she think of me seeing how i behave or how about such situation at a dating with random encounter with negative joe doe maybe i think too much but how i behave could determine the outcome of that date or some other important event when will humanity get wiser when will they no longer be selfcentered and learn to emphasize and resonate with others while this gotten better i feel it will still take some good number of generations from my mom i dont have to be by her side all the time i just like knowing that were both home at the same time we see each other every morning before we leave to our separate jobs  every morning she hugs me  tells me that everything is going to be ok after i tell her how im feeling she texts me nearly every day while were at work to check in with me and ill ask her if shes working late if she is i wont see her until the next morning and my day gets worse if she isnt my mood gets better almost instantly any tips on dealing with this i dont want her to feel like she shouldnt take the extra hours because of me im always super distant but more and more recently i feel like i cannot live another second before i burst or implode i feel this pressure inside me constricting me and swelling form my core to just under my skin hard and heavy squeezing out every now and then when i lose it and break down but sitll remaining it numbs me it eats up my emotions and with every disappointment or anxiety i experience the ringing in my ears gets louder and the pressure worsens i dont even know if this fits in the anxiety forum but ive had gad for a lot of my life among other things so i dont know if its connected but im freaking out because i just want to know whats wrong with me and every time i want to be present and experience my emotions i feel like a freaking balloon flying away from myself hello i can relate to what you are going through i often have periods of time where i feel like im about to explode because of the severity of my anxiety and it is super stressful because i have no idea what the do when it happens i agree with jennifer have you been evaluated it is definitely worth it to go on some medications in order to help you out as you work on the rest of it best of luck to you last time i posted here about a month ago i went to the school  study issues part of the forums and ranted about an overlystrict teacher i had from eight years ago who caused me and my other classmates a lot of suffering theyve likely shrugged and moved on since then but i never have i guess i wanted to let it all out but now i feel really bad about doing so what i feel particularly guilty for is revealing the teachers name in that post and why i did it i revealed their name because i wanted to humiliate them to let them know the pain they have caused me i wanted to give them pain and receive vengeance it completely backfired and all im left with is emptiness and guilt in the end i was too afraid to even check if i got any replies let alone read them this has happened many times during my time here i post something then am too afraid of negative feedback or even criticism to read the replies then feel like a complete coward im not sure if having feelings invalidated many times in childhood counts as trauma but if theres any reason why i feel so afraid that must be it i probably will be too scared to read the replies here too maybe i should just leave the site yeah the anxiety is a pain i am constantly worried about my surroundings because i feel like something is going to go wrong i wind up looking around myself like a mad man whenever i am out of my dorm very stressful on me i feel better since ive started the lithium but it is really too soon to tell my pdoc felt it would help with the anxiety as well as other symptoms im also trying dbt  there are a couple of threads in the depression forum here on this site hang in there i cant stand the anxiety i know it is so hard hello i am new here and a little nervous i am 22and since around the age of 17 or 18 i had this phobia of being a pedophile i dont tell many people because people make this assumption that i am i had this fear because all my life i could never understand how people can be so sick and evil to hurt an innocent child so i said to myself imagine being the most evil and repulsive thing on this earth and presto my fear begun as a college student i never had a relationship with a woman and i am still a virgin so often i get urges i try not to be a chronic masturbator so i do it about once or twice a month sometimes i can go for 6 months without it anyway my fear of pedophiles scare me so much that the unthinkable happens when i fantasize about women during masturbation sick images of kids cross my mind the more i try to refrain from them the more they pop in i never fondled molested or beat a child nor ever intend to as a sociology major i even hope to work with them a lot of children are being taken advantage of and i hoped to look after them some day i once spoke to a college counselor who mentioned the difference between merging reality and fantasy in fact i even got mad because i said this is not a fantasy there unwanting thoughts that interrupt my healthy fantasies i cant figure out if i would never hurt a child why do i feel as if i just committed the most evil act ever ive been having severe panic that are so bad that i sometimes i feel even faint or like pulling out my hair any way to calm down cause my meds only help a little and show can i stop them from becoming severe  i hope posting this isnt a mistake ive been a member of psych central for three years but have barely made over fifty posts due to my anxiety of being judged this is one of the safest sites ive seen online but humans are complex creatures and theres always going to be people out there who enjoy sewing discord aka trolls as a result i have barely commented in my three years of being a member here im so frightened of negative feedback and would rather avoid it all truth is a few years ago somebody made a post on this very site describing themselves as the only real person in the world the post got a few comments ranging from cool acquiescence to negativity and i myself made a slightly snappish reply telling them they didnt think of the consequences of writing a potentially offensive post before hitting submit to this day i still wonder if i did the right thing and if i hurt their feelings thinking of my comment makes me feel like i deserve to be judged and condemned i want to talk about my issues but im too afraid but then i thought what if i talked about my anxiety of posting instead still i feel scared right now thinking of what kind of comments i might get ive come out to people in the past looking for help and received only scorn in return i understand what youre talking about to some degree ive kind of had to force myself to be active on this site it got easier after a while even right now im a little concerned that im posting in a subforum that ive never posted in i feel like it isnt my place to just show up and start talking but your post struck a chord with me ive sent a few private messages here and there on pc and even though each one was met with friendliness i still am asking myself if it was okay that i took that step and initiated a conversation im always questioning if i did the right thing or if i just ended up irritating people fortunately the trolls and such seem very few and far between on this site i really dont think anyone will be judging you for making this post im happy you did too if you feel like it some day tell me your story zero judgement here yes post away this is a very safe environment and i enjoy my time here i think there are a lot of people on here that feel the same but just have never mentioned it i myself end up deleting a lot of posts before i submit them because at times i feel my responses arent overly helpful due to emotional numbing or just not being in a place where im able to effectively communicate what i want to say i used to live a couple of hours from midland and wanted to stay in michigan but had to leave because there was not much going on jobswise i dont know how much things have improved but im sure its just hard to find work around there bad experiences with one job doesnt mean you cant do other totally different jobs and doesnt mean you wont be able to get any of them employers dont know what you did wrong at this other job datingwise i feel very worthy but dont feel wanted at all i agree you want someone who wants you back and at least as much as you want them i feel like thats not going to happen though i dont want or need a pep talk on it thoughi am accepting it personally i think there is a big disconnect between wanting people who are worthy and how people are actually choosing people who arent so i could never take my dating issues to be a reflection of my worth people seem to be picking others based on things that have nothing to do with being a good person or a good potential mate i was not able to speak in school until about fourth or fifth grade i was dramatically mute in preschool i remember that i did not feel a single thing i was very detached i just existed without any feelings i got depressed in high school and didnt speak unless necessary and scripted at home or school i wonder if i was scared or detached or both i am angry that no one helped me with these things even though they could see that i was not normal and if it is actually social anxiety or a reaction to home life and terrifying parents i suppose the school environment was uniquely terrifying in its own right and i am wondering how this translates as an adult if i snap away i will forget to do everything and fail out of school etc so i cant detach but also in my social life which is almost nonexistent i dont like to have unfamiliar conversations and new people saying hi how are you is fullfilling enough everything is such a chore now when i talk it feels like sometimes the words are coming from someone else when i handle my parents i gently coach them or i am a steady controlled presence for them where do these words come from they all seem so insincere im very very unhappy somehow i have fallen into the trap of the dichotomy of either being in control or not being in control in reality im never in control its all a facade i feel like im pretending ive only talked about this to people a few times but i feel like i need to talk about it now and i dont see my therapist for another week i had one of my phobias triggered majorly the other day and i still feel really freaked out by it im sure some of this will boarder on triggering so be warned before you go on i have a pretty serous phobia of semi trucks several years ago i was driving on the interstate going to an internship for school the interstate here was three lanes each way and i was maybe 12 to 1 mile from my exit id moved to the far right lane so i wouldnt have to fight traffic when i got to the exit i drove pretty close to too high over the speed limit at this time and ended up passing a semi that was in the middle lane as i passed him he moved into the right lane behind me but too soon the semi tapped the outside corner of my back bumper as he switched lanes i didnt feel it happen but within seconds i started losing control of my car i fought it hard but lost control and ended up driving across the three lanes of traffic and crashed into the median i was so panicked i remember the day in feelings and snapshots of images still especially scary was one snapshot when i was perpendicular to the lanes of traffic i remember looking out my window and seeing the front of another semi coming towards me luckily i didnt get hit by anyone else and there was a cop not far behind where i crashed who was on the scene almost as soon as my car stopped moving my car was pretty damaged but luckily i wasnt hurt just scared and in shock so fast forward to now yesterday actually i was out running some errands and got to the stoplights at an intersection i needed to turn through i was already pulling into the intersection and the light was turning yellow so i knew i needed to go before it was red i started pulling through the intersection and from the other direction a semi decided not to stop at the red light i froze up it was like a mirror of my memories of the first accident i really cant believe that i didnt just slam on the brakes and panic i was lucky that the semi was going pretty slow and was able to stop before he hit me and i got through the intersection and to the store without any damage to the car or myself i didnt realize that it affected me so much but i started panicking earlier today when i had to drive by a couple of semis this is the worst fear for me to have especially since my boyfriend doesnt have his license so i do all our driving i see a semi truck and im so afraid of them hitting me or doing something stupid that will hurt me i feel anxious just typing this up even though theres nothing to hurt me now i dont know if im looking for any answers or advice or anything i just needed to get this out to someone who might understand thanks for reading cold air cold water or an ice pack on you forehead or neck can slow it down before it gets too bad take calming breaths when i feel faint i lie on the floor with my feet up i try to remind myself that although i am acting very frightened i am safe and that the feeling will pass i try to remember that im going through a difficult stage in life but that i will adjust and overcome every new feeling of a panic attack scared me which made the panic attack worse breathing temperature change reassuring thoughts getting in a safe position to recover are the things that help me also try to embrace something that comforts you a memory a picture a pet person pillow etc im sorry you are dealing with this in my experience they get shorter and less intense after youve worked through the thoughtsfeelings that are causing them shortly after youve experienced the worst of them notice how you can feel quite normal again although unhappy youre having panic attacks ive had a nagging cough for weeks now ive seen the doctor and it has only since gotten even worse i feel 100 but i just cant stop coughing and how does this have anything to do with my mental health a great deal actually i am completely humiliated by it it is triggered primarily by talking so i have avoided doing anything where this might take place i am extremely selfconscious i have a constant running commentary in my head about how i draw attention to myself for having faults with everything naturally i am incredibly conscious then that i might make people uncomfortable laugh at me or even be angry this dang cough has caused this so much so that it has ruined the last several weeks of my life  all because i am afraid of what people might think of me i am embarrassed to speak on the phone this means i cant speak with my boyfriend and others i cant go out without feeling that all eyes are upon me i am moving in a week and am turning down offer after offer to meet friends before i do so i am even turning down lunch with my son i should be able to say the heck what others think but this is not in my nature if only i had the where with all to do so all that i can think of is that i will be the subject of scorn and ridicule i am old to be a student but better late than never oddly i found my chance to go to school and study accounting which i had been talking about doing for ten years at a time when i was unemployed i feel like having an associate degree under my belt gives me more options in life before i always felt stuck not going anywhere i wont give up i will keep pushing on and pray to overcome anxieties thanks everybody for your support lately ive developed this thing where i just have to check things let me explain im a ride operator at an amusement park and every day the rides go through several inspections as the operator i do the last inspection and open the ride there is a sheet with a bunch of boxes that we check off if its working say if the fan works we check the box that says so then we sign it and check off that the ride is ready to open lately i have this thing where every couple hours or so i need to check the inspection sheet and makes sure i checked everything off that should have been and that i signed it and filled it out properly even after checking it once i feel the need to check it again later on also when i go hiking i feel the need to stop and make sure i have something in my backpack that i need checking for my car keys are my most frequent stop ill be walking and my brain says i dont think you have your keys with you you gotta see if theyre still in your bag and ill keep on walking because logically i know the keys are in there theyre not going to jump out on their own but after a few minutes it drives me crazy because what if i forgot them in the car or dropped them last time i opened my bag so then i check and sure enough the keys or whatever i think im missing are there and then ill walk a mile and go through this again if i dont check my anxiety rapidly increases as time goes on this is new for me and i really dont like it do you experience something like this do you know of anything that helps should i check the things sooner to avoid the anxiety increase or should i hold out for as long as i can what exactly is happening people make fun of my possibly anxietyrelated health issues they tell me im just a hypochondriac but i really do feel physically very sick which causes me to be afraid to do things like have a drink or even just go out because im scared i will make the symptoms worse or just be very bad company because i feel too bad to be fully present one time my sister got mad at me about something so she started mocking me walking around being like oh i feel soooo sick that was 5 years ago and it still hurts so bad thinking about it i didnt choose any of this im crying writing this its so awful i wish i knew how to make it stop i feel i am always explaining the justification for my anxiety sometimes all i want is some validation i realise with some angst that i do this here too so i went to los angeles this summer to visit my sister we had an amazing time she introduced me to weed and we got high togther many times one day we went and bought a 300 mg edible and i ate the whole edible me and my sister knew that these were the good times and that we would remember these good moments i was already a nostalgic person and i would cry sometimes and hug my sister so the night i ate th he edible i was already high but i wanted to get higher we went to chick fil a too and we ate i laid down in bed and i out of nowhere started to cry then after that i threw up and i became extremly confused not being able to understand anything i started saying im sorry god and my sister was telling me that im in la and i just took an edible i then just laid down and fell asleep next morning i felt weird like nothing was real no anxiety just a weird feeling we went to disneyland that day and i just felt like nothing was real it went away tho i came back to north carolina after my one month vacay at la i cried because i love my sister and it was a great vacation my sister sent me a weed vape pen because i just thought it would be nice to smoke some weed i smoked it a few times until one day i panicked for no reason but it wasnt as intense as the one in la so i brushed that off and decided to not smoke weed anymore i felt derealized again too but it went away i then said to myself okay im just gonna take one puff of my weed pen i got high but deep down i was anxious that i might get another panic attack so all that went away and i just brushed it off me and my sister listened to the jay z 444 album during my la vacation i decided to listen to it again i listened to a song and i started to panic for no reason and i knew i was panicking for no reason this happened probably 3 weeks or a month ago ever since then ive had anxiety for no reason i would have weird feelings in certain lighting mostly fluorescent lighting i started to worry that i might be going crazy aswell sometimes i look at myself and sometimes im just like wow thats me and recently like 2 days ago i started to worry and think i started to think about how i go to school everyday and how its like a loop i started to worry and i hate it because ive never thought like this before and i hate thinking like this i would at times feel better during these past 3 weeks but then it would come back its so annoying the day i listened to the jay z album i also started to think a lot about faces and how they have 2 eyes and stupid  like that that went away though i fear sometimes when i fee better if he anxiety will come back i hate this guys i just want to feel better i wish i never smoked that ing weed i wish i never smoked that stupid useless weed please guys i isnt want to feel better ive noticed that all this anxiety is stupid as  and that my life is great i have the bestest of friends who have been helping me out i cry sometimes aswell i cry because i love my family and friends and i dont want to lose them by going insane i want hope guys please please guys i dont know what to do i want to go to a psychologist aswell but i just want hope rn because i feel like ill never be myself again all this anxiety and all these thoughts are annoying it worries me when i think that this anxiety will never go away i regret smoking weed i never needed that  please guys i want hope ive never felt like this before i have always had social anxiety since childhood very severe had selective mutism in my 20s i had panic attacks and anxiety so bad i got to point i felt like i was going to die around the clock i have been on and off sertraline since then and now in my 40s i have been taking sertraline for 10 years at about 100mg the last 2 years i have been breaking end off so i probably get about 8090mg three months ago i decided i had had enough and wanted to try and go off of them i felt the withdrawal so i stayed at 50mg so for at least two months i have been taking 50mg and have been perfectly fine then last week i started feeling crazy i felt like i had to get out of my skin and was crying and didnt know what to do it started because i was having trouble sleeping because of a sore leg if i was inside the house i felt the need to be outside i couldnt stand the feel of tight pants around my ankles everything bothered me if my nose was blocked i had to get out of bad and keep walking around to clear it i also could not even look at a computer screen or my phone because it drove me crazy and it was too much to take i even had to leave house at 2 am to drive around with my windows open going who knows where i felt like i wanted to die i now know why people kill themselves and why people are addicted to drugs a few days later i asked to have a blood test wasnt sure if it was menopause or what and i found out my iron level was low hemoglobin 102 i have been low before but never felt this crazy low iron can cause anxiety and depression and i am already prone to it so now i know why i felt crazy i felt as if i was having a breakdown randomly crying at work etc i have been trying to take my iron pills now but sometimes forget and i know it is still low is feeling like i do a phobia or anxiety even right now i feel like crying and want to be let out of the house i live with other people right now and feel like i cant be near them i feel they are causing me to feel like this i feel like i always need to be doing something somewhere other than so called home i have been using so much gas on my car because i feel the need to keep getting away i was told by dr to go back up to the 100mg sertraline so i did for a few days i got better now im back to 50mg i am writing this now and i dont feel good i feel like i will not be able to sleep with my leg pain and i feel like i am going stir crazy has anyone experienced this feeling of having to get out of where you are almost like a claustrophobic feeling help i was on sertraline years ago and withdrew and told myself i would never take again withdrawal is sooo bad i dont want to take it because i feel it makes me make bad decisions and makes me stay in situations i shouldnt be in it makes you take things you should not take i have issues in my life that i just put up with and should not put up with i had a somewhat abusive husband that i stayed with until i withdrew off sertraline years ago my life has been stuck in the same position for ten years i need to move on and the drugs make you just sit there and take it i have also read all about the horror stories of withdrawal and have lived through withdrawal before tonight i took 100mg because of how i am feeling but when my iron level goes back up i will try to withdraw again i stopped for sex drive reasons also the numbness does go away somewhat after years of taking it it also makes you tired and it may be why i eat so much also i am convinced these drugs are poison for your brain yes some people do need it i apologize in advance if this post is too long  but please bear with me  thank you for taking the time to read back in june of this year i seemed to experience some sort of breakdown i was so paralyzed in stress and anxiety that i completely couldnt function at work or home i ended up quitting my job and had to rest at home during this time i also had this feeling that i could lash out at anyone  like my manager but mostly my parents who i live with i felt boiling anger and resentment which ill explain more below to give some context  i am 24 years old and have lived at home since graduating college 2 years ago ive overall had a happy upbringing but did feel a bit directionless and depressed during college some things happened that affected me i felt pretty low and depressed about moving back home upon graduating but didnt know what else to do i ended up taking a job in my hometown which was a good opportunity even though i dont feel like i fit in my town and always wanted to be in the city i dont really have many friends around here in terms of my parents theyre immigrants from europe and have always put some pressure on my sister and me to succeed in life so ive never told them about my struggles with depression  fast forward to june this year i had this breakdown and continue to be at home as i mentioned above i felt an intense feeling of resentment and anger directed mostly towards my parents i felt like i was sick of everyone in my life and tired of pretending i was ok and happy i always felt this pressure to be the good child in my parents eyes i specifically felt resentment towards my mom for the emotional invalidation ive gotten from her over the years to go along with these feelings i felt crippling anxiety and had intense panic attacks and this urge to escape and like i was going to absolutely lose it i kept telling myself just burst out and express your painanger stop holding back from your parents but the anxiety was so bad i couldnt do it no matter how much i tried it felt like i was going to go out of control which scared me  over the following months since then i feel pretty numbed out depressed i guess like i feel very isolated from the world and nothing interests me at all im seeing a psychiatrist so hopefully that will help my concerns looking back on all this is why do i feel numb now and is it because of those intense feelings i sensed how do i get back to feeling like myself and normal and a part of the world sometimes i feel like im on the verge of breaking down emotionally or having a meltdown like theres something deep within me that needs to come out or fall apart  has anyone ever experienced this or what do you make of it when is your appointment you need the meds sooner rather then later i feel for you i have anxiety and depression and would much rather deal with the depression if it gets too bad and you do go to the hospital i doubt they would put you ip since youre not suicidal theyll probably give you a sedative like valium and maybe a prescription for some more im sorry you are struggling sending big hugs i consistently have higher anxiety on monday and even sunday night it is most likely because i have to work on monday and all the stresses and anticipation hits me i feel like i go through this cycle almost every week my anxiety is high on monday and i spend the rest of the days bringing it down to a level i can more easily cope with is there a way to break this pattern other than quitting my job of course ive been putting off getting a therapist for a long time because i lost my job and cant afford it i decided a few days ago just to go and put it on credit cards for the time being because my anxiety has gotten really bad and i just have no idea what else to do anymore every waking minute feels like pure torture and i have the thought that i want to just die many times per day so anyway i started trying to call up therapists in my insurance network and it seems like no one ever answers their phone i mean it makes sense that they would often be away from their phones if theyre in sessions with clients but how in the heck does anyone ever manage to schedule an appointment with a therapist if they never answer their phones  of course the few that do answer are completely booked for the rest of the year this is stressing me out and making my anxiety even worse i have no friends and no supportive family members to turn to for support either i feel like i have no options and nowhere to go i get this too i cant seem to cure the lowlevel dread i feel but if i have a particularly hard sunday i will identify and write down everything about the next dayweek that is worrying me i will try to come up with an action plan for everything im worried about sometimes this is enough to reduce the dread back to manageable levels sometimes its not though ive tried to explain this to many people but all fail to come to a conclusion on why it is i feel the way i do when i have my anxiety attacks so i question whether or not anyone shares this experience or if it is extremely irregular when i have my anxiety attacks which are fairly common id say i have multiple a month they build up for days and days then i finally outburst when i express them outwardly i become completely detached from everything and seems as if i lose all control over my body emotions brain etc but i also simultaneously feel the most control ive ever experienced i feel like i have nothing to worry about in the world it starts with anger i commonly flip my bed over completely slam my fists into my walldoorfloor until they bloody then i break down and cry for a very short period then i have what as i describe as an addiction i look forward to this part of my attacks i have intense hysteria and laugh uncontrollably for a while and i clean up everything i just did tidy everything up then have a hot shower and im completely fine ive never spoken to anyone with anxiety as well so i dont know if this is normal feedback would be appreciated im fairly concerned ive become increasingly isolated over the years and i barely talk to people anymore i live with my mother and my cousin but we dont have a good relationship so i dont talk to them much either yesterday an acquaintance that i hadnt spoken with in a few months texted me so i started getting anxious and overthinking things to a ridiculous extreme like i cant think of a thing to say i dont have anything interesting to say i dont want to say something weird or dumb or annoying she knows vaguely of some of my issues so she probably pities me i doubt shes texting me because she likes me as a person im not likeable im not even a very nice person and then it always takes me way too long to respond a text and this is just with texting or talking online in person i can barely look at someones face i feel lonely most of the time and i wish i had someone to talk to but when the opportunity presents i just wanna go hide somewhere ive been meaning to go to a therapist ive searched in my area and ive found one that i want to go see but i havent called yet i dont even know what to say tbh like what is someone even supposed to say in this situation in the meantime if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this type of issue id appreciate it hello im not sure if anyones ever experienced this but for some time now ive been experiencing hyperawareness of life particularly in the emotional sense of things relations with other people and the fluidity of life its hard to explain but for example if im in a fight with someone in my head i become aware of each moment and feeling in the process like i anticipate what is going to happen next or what im going to be feeling next emotionally this doesnt allow me to experience my feelingsthe moment smoothly because its like this hijacking mechanism that tells me oh youre going to be feeling this next its like overanalyzing my and others progression of feelings does anyone know what im talking about this may be coming from feeling extremely jaded ive been depressed for a long time now and i really feel hopeless and at the end of my rope like nothing is going to help its really hard for me to get my emotions and pain out  i almost feel crazy and like im making this all up because of how empty i feel i dont remember what normal life feels like im new to this support site i remember being part of one when i was pregnant with my daughter and it really seemed to help mostly because i was the one offering my help and doing what i could to help other new moms today i find myself in a group and its because i need help i have struggled with obsessive thoughts and anxiety since i was 10 years old now im 36 and my world seems to be spiraling out of control i quit my job and moved to a new city with my daughter and boyfriend my boyfriend started a new business that i am helping him to grow starting a new business is scary my daughter was diagnosed with autism about 8 years ago and i work with other children who have been diagnosed with autism my life really seems great on paper but in my mind im destined to fail and i cant seem to do anything right i get chest pains nightly and i cry for no reason i cant sleep and i fidget constantly lately i fight with my boyfriend all of the time mostly because he moves things out of their designated place in the house ive begun to obsess over where things are placed and if theyre not then it sets me off on my own i decided to go to the doctor yesterday it didnt take them long to suggest a medication to go on and after 15 hours and some questionnaires later i was released back into the wild this is what brings me here today i have a prescription sitting in my nightstand and i am terrified to take it it promises me a world i havent known since i was a small child but i am so scared it will change me i dont know what to do im here because i hope somebody can help me work through this or share their experience taking a prescription for the first time causes a new wave of fear in me im lost and i feel more broken than i ever have felt hi yzen  man  i hate it when that happens  i hear you i own a 14  a 12 year old honda civic ex  dead mint  with less than 60k  plus a 35 year old mobile home  i mean geez  i am always getting taken to the cleaners  i feel for yeh  really but the best thing to do  is try to but it behind you  sure it hard  real hard there have been times i would go food shopping and think did i over pay   i would stop on the side of the road and check my wallet to make sure  i could not even wait to get home so i know where you are coming from  it sux  but everything cost so much  i mean geez heres what i would do  grab a snack and chat  get your mind off of it  you really cant do anything about it anyway i hope u feel better and u r not alone  me  i am real clean  lol later kp i have felt i had made huge progress in overcoming my anxiety mainly social anxiety i went through therapy take anti depressantsanti anxiety medication and today it was put to the test and i failed miserably i was invited to a support group for abuse survivors and i felt lost and sick almost the entire 2 hours i didnt speak a word and i felt that i was about to burst into tears for the whole session i felt so prepared and ready for it that it shocked me at how horrible i felt throughout i just do not know how i can improve and feel okay socializing my goal was to go to college this year and after tonight i feel so horribly defeated and hopeless i feel i just wont be able to do this anymore i dont know what to do anymore for a few months ive really struggled partially i think its been related to a visit to the dentist half a year ago which revealed quite suddenly that i have many problems and not nearly enough funds to solve them so ive been saving since then and trying to recover mentally and today i had enough courage for a consultation now im afraid that it was too soon because of the effect the interaction with the people has had on me although maybe there is no good time from the inability to formulate responses to speak clearly to sweating all the time not being able to follow what the other person is saying then fighting with myself about it on the way home plus the fear of pain and them clearly knowing that im feeling it whats worse i cant in good conscience treat myself to a sweet as a rewardcomfort i just hate myself not in life not in the disease what i have goes beyond labels i am writing here this time because i feel i need to share and i feel i need to hide i am embarassed of myself of my fear of my behaviours and my decisions if i ever had a true friend in my life i would turn their lifes in to a mess because that is what i am i can putt anyone off i push people away from me as i am i could write anywhere else but i feel embarassed about what people who had see my posts and already know a bit of my story will think i feel embarassed of who i am i can read criticism and disaproval in peoples words and faces all the time i cant trust anyone its beyond me and i feel alone people think i dont like them and that i am weird but if i explained this to them they would find me even more weird and i wouldnt be able to look at them again in shame there was this person that wanted to hang out with me just the two but i have to complicate every thing in my mind i wanted and i didnt because is always awful i made up a lot of scenarios in my mind for such a small simple thing because of my vague and sparse answears online messages he deduced i didnt want to go out that probably i was trying to avoid him whatever nothing is going to happen now and it makes me feel safe but at the same time i made such a fool of myself he is a nice person not threatening but even so i was stressed so he must think i dont like him as a person or that i am very weird or both and i am mad at me\n",

      "doc: i hated the way i looked so i got my ears pinned back thinking it would make me feel better  its what i blamed not socialisingnot asking girls outnot going for jobs i wanted  not doing the things most people do in their 20s so at 28 i decided to get my ears pinned back hoping to feel better but whilst i was happy with the initial change  i cant see the difference now and i still feel empty i took out loads of loans coz im addicted to gambling i pay 600 a month to loans which is half my pay i still live at home at 28 even tho ive wanted to move out for ages but i cant due to financial situation my job makes me wanna cry but if i took another job it would be a massive pay cut my job pays well for what i do i get through every day in work by thinking  if i get fed up i can just walk out and kill myself problem solved i always think people hate me  judge me i always think people are mad at me or mocking me even if they arent im sat at gp now and im gonna tell her how i feel so i can get tablets citalopram made me feel awful before  the only thing that has stopped me before is the fact that if i failed which the way my life goes is probable i wouldnt want my family  friends knowing  they all see me as mr happy  energetic  make people laugh smile  random and i cant tell anyone in my family  because my sister has depression  stress because she was victim of sexual assault so compared o that my problems are nothing also my dads old and i wouldnt want it upsetting him or making him ill his dad killed himself  also i think of all the things that will neve happen to me again  ill never be going to my first day at school  play my first football game  even when i watch films from my childhood it brings me to tears coz i can remember them coming out when i was young and everything was easy  i know its selfish but i cant help feeling like this hi loppysmum  welcome to the forum sorry to hear youre having a hard time dealing with anxiety im not an expert by any means but i do suffer really badly from anxiety and a lot of the behaviour you mention reasonates quite a lot with me  i feel like i can understand and empathise to a point but im struggling with dealing with the abuse that comes when hes having a hard time he becomes aggressive blameful and hurtful and its hard to know where to draw the line  i recently took a personality test via myers briggs and i came out as like enfj which means like your an altruistic person etc and u put other people first you care about people you stand up for people etc  your probably wondering why im telling u this  well this is why people with anxiety usually need constant reassurance  because i try and get along with everyone if someones quiet with me i think that ive done something to offend them or they hate me etc which is quite extreme  so i seek reassurance are you alright  you were quiet today etc and sometimes people will come back with yeh fine or not respond or whatever because they are busy and then ill be like oh my god they hate me so ill say something like fine if u dont wanna be friends then just dont speak to me  delete me on facebook or we and obviously for the other person this is incredibly hurtful but its done to illicit a caring response from the other individual i actully think us men are 100 times worse at it than women who are usually the ones were seeking the caring response from it can also be mentaly taxing as you say because you understand where he is coming from but it should never be a free pass to make someone elses life misery if it makes you feel better i know from what youve said im sure he loves you a great deal but you need to stand up for yourself i remember i behaved similarly to how your boyfriend did with a female friend of mine and she was caring and understanding but i started messaging her a ridiculous amount wanting to talk and she was busy with work or we so she didnt respond and im quite manic anyway with the way i talk and how random i am well anyway eventully i said hurtful things to get her to respond and she came back with a massive message saying listen i dont hate you i actully care a great deal about you but the way youve been behaving is way out of order i have to work  i have stuff to do  i cant be there 247 and you shouldnt say horrible things if u really care that much  i dont hate you  we are friends  its just sometimes i dont know how to respond to the things you say and we havent really spoken since but my point is  im gutted were not friends anymore and i probably needed her to tell me that  it was just that i love speaking to people so when she stopped messaging for unrelated reasons i thought she hated memy point is im sure if u were frank with him it would have the same responseand the sooner its said it could save your relationship  something along the lines of listen i do love you but the way youre acting is unreasonable and when you shout at me and abuse me its really hurtful and it makes it hard for me to empathise with you and i dont know if i can carry on being shouted at  also let me just say  youre obviously a wonderful person  gf because i know a lot of people would just give up on someone with regards to the hurtful things people with anxiety say sometimes albeit to manipulate a response of caring  reassurance but you are on here trying to get help so fair play just remember its probably down to the fact that hes insecure and he wants u to say like yes i love u no im not gonna leave u etc its even harder when your in a relationship because the normal jealousy etc is like x10 even if he trusts u ohh shes gonna find someone better better looking etc but never ever just take the abuse  be firm youre a human being too and in hindsight if id have hat that chat with my friend a lot sooner i probably wouldnt be absoloutely gutted that she wont speak to me anymore  goodluck  if u wanna chat more  send me a msg  x hey birdsatdawn  im sure there would be free therapy that organisations in your area can provide  what country are u in you can tell me area if u want but u dont have to sorry to hear you suffer from social anxiety i do as well and it sucks  i always feel people are juding me or thinking badly of me  and maybe they are but most of the itme people have their own problems and are as insecure are we are they are just better at hiding it  feel free to msg me if u want  i feel your pain  i always feel like im missing out on stuff with not going out but i cant change my mindset x yeah only makes me feel better for a bit   im not  concerned about hurting myself or getting in trouble   there is no chance of me having happy fulfilling life  i felt this low for 14 years and nothings changed   yeah i tried counceling it was rubbish she didnt understand everything she knew about mental health shed learnt from a bookso how could she know what i was going through   a lot of things are making me feel lower than usual my lifes a mess its a train wreck i have financial problems i love someone who doesnt love me back i hate my job i get through every day by saying i can alwayd kill myself tonight i dont have to put up with it tomorrow i lost friends because of how i act due to how i feel and   one person who understands me i want more than friendship but she says because were both unstable it is never going to happen she needs someone who can give her support and she doesnt think i can because she thinks i need support myself  which isnt necessarily true helping people when i felt low before is the only thing that stopped me killing myself  suicide seems a lot more appealing now x i know i shudnt say this as cancer is so common and probably everyone here has lost loved ones to it  ive lost family to it  but the way i feel at the moment i wudnt care if it is  two people i really like have basiclly said we like you but your hard to take sometimes coz your constantly buzzing and 100mph and they havent messaged me since and that really hurts  i like my gp  but if i tell her that shell refuse to see me  i dont think ill ever be able to get it checked because of how i am i feel if i had isolated myself more than i have done having people not speaking to me wudnt bother me i hate self diagnosis but when i type in how i feel on google it brings up hpd  blaaaaaaaaaaaassaaaaaah i think i crave these peoples attention i want their affection and their approval and i feel like a kid living in a grown up world  i recently typed in what i was feeling and borderline personality disorder shows up and whilst im not keen on self diagnosis when i read that a lot of it feels like i could have written it myself such as the manipulating people into nurturing  bah i thought citalopram was working but the more i think about it the more i feel worthless i would say low but citalopram has pretty much numbed high  low ui understand the bit about not telling me but if anything it makes me feel worse im starting to doubt if theres anything wrong with me or whether im just a neurotic hyperchondriac you know its like when people label someone and they say hes an aggresivee person wventully that person becomes what they are being labeled  what are the long term effects of these drugs  nobody knows  they could make my hair fall out  or give me a tiny willy  sorry to be graphic but it could happen sometimes i feel so low and then sometimes i feel quite happy  mixed in with feeling low  if i was depressed why would i have feelings of happiness or feel some happyness at doing things i enjoy and other times i hate them  keep trying to help jim its helping hearing your experiences  but im stubborn  like a honey badger  only difference being honey badgers dont care what people think they bite em in the ballsacks i do care what people think but i dont bite haha hi miss kitty  thank you  i will do and thanks again to everyone for their advice  can i just ask does anyone here suffer with irritability  overly aggresive reactions as a result of their anxiety  yeasterday some guy in the car behind was driving behind me and getting a bit close and i slowed down because i know he wanted to go fast and he flashed his lights so i pulled up on the side of the road which just happens to be where he was stopping but i didnt know that at the time and thought he was going to get out and moan so i looked in the wing mirror and he was glaring at me  so i got out of the car quickly and slammed the door and started walking at his car and gesturing whats your problem although maybe with some expletives involved hoping id antagonise him into a reaction but he looked quite startled and just sat their so i got in my car and drove off  and then there was another incident today which i wont go in to but on both occasions i had a feeling of my chest tightening and my breathing starting to go rapidly like when youre body gets ready to fight except mine seems to be triggered quite easily  usully believe it or not im really mild mannered and i tend not to lose my temper but then someone will do something that really annoyes me and then ill just see red the most recent time being when i was in my local chip shop and i really like the owners  staff who are all really nice and friendly with me and happy to come from india and often give me like extra large chips and discounts etc and i was in there and id said hello and two ginger lads were outside screaming expletives at each other and eventully game in with a girl and whilst we were quing up and waiting the staff where taking orders from the lady in front and the two ginger lads started taking the piss and going but but ding ding and all that types of rubbish and i flipped and gripped the one kid by the throat and said something along the lines of does it make you feel big being racist towards people who are working hard to earn money and contributing more to our country than you ever will you and the girl was screaming get off him get off him and his mate was just standing there scared even though theyd been acting the tough guys walking in with their hoods up i basicly then said something along the lines of fck and leave before i really lose my tempter i looked around and the staff looked shocked and i felt really bad because i felt that even though i was sticking up for them they saw me as some kind of nutter now  in their defence they are probably right my friend said my eyes glazed over and i was ignoring her as she was talking to me  which scared her because shed never seen it in 20 years of knowing me and i was focused on the ginger lad i was holding my question is this is that a symptom of anxiety or is it just me being over sensitive to someone insulting people who i am fond of who probably now think im some kind of thug and trying to make excuses for myself  anybody got any experience of this x  ps im still angry now because i feel ive let myself down  as i want to be liked and ive obviously given them a negative impression of me which they didnt have before  even though i was trying to do the right think albeit in the wrong fashion but looking back at it  had i of just spoken to them it wouldnt have done anything theyd have just done it again  and whilst i cant gurentee they wont do it again to someone else  theyd probably think a little harder about it hey somerset   thanks for the reply   i dont wanna go there because im feeling suicidal maybe anxious but mostly because i feel safe their and when i was younger they made me better  the people who work there are in a proffesion that cares for people so on the most part they are caring  friendly people sometimes when i get anxious  fed up  get upset i leave the house and just go wandering  so i was just wondering if someone sat in like reception for ages or in a waiting area if theyd kick you out thanks for your answer hey amathus    not really although i feel quite at ease at home as well its just hospitals is another level of feeling at ease im obsessed with what people think about me and i think its to do with the fact that at hospitals they look after everyone regardless of appearance  personality i know no one here is an expert on diagnosing people but some of the symptoms i have seem like they are from a wide variety of mental health disorders for example   i found this from ocd page   washers are afraid of contamination they usually have cleaning or handwashing compulsions  checkers repeatedly check things oven turned off door locked etc that they associate with harm or danger  doubters and sinners are afraid that if everything isnt perfect or done just right something terrible will happen or they will be punished  counters and arrangers are obsessed with order and symmetry they may have superstitions about certain numbers colors or arrangements   hoarders fear that something bad will happen if they throw anything away they compulsively hoard things that they dont need or use   ive done all of the above but they were all phases for me and not to extreme just mild versions of the above but one thing always seemed to replace by another obsession   as i mentioned im obsessed with what people think about me even to the point where every morning i approach a zebra crossing to get to work and when i can see it usually still takes me 5 mins to get their im already thinking about thanking people for stopping for me and at one point ive even stopped when ive heard a car coming  waited for it to go past and then crossed    i dont really go out to town  social situations much for fear of being made fun of ridiculed or we and i dont drink so im very aware of whats going on which probs makes it worse i hate the way i look and i want to have my ears pinned back  probably dosent help that ive got a massive disfiguring scar on my head from a surgery i had when i was younger and a wonky nose from having it broken a few times i been told i have nice eyes though    i worry about growing old im quite childish in the way i am and i fear when i grow older that i wont be able to act like i do now because people will think of me as strange i even contemplated ending my life im 26 now so that technically i dont get old forver young dont worry i wouldnt do it id feel guilty for my parents   i fear my parents dying my dads in his 70s   i am fairly energetic when i speak and people have said to me before uhmmmmm do you have adhd and im genuinely fairly happy but when i get angry i really lose my rag   sometimes i think to myself whats the point being nice to people when a lot of people get a lot further treating people like rubbish   sometimes when people are annoying me i visualise myself using them as a boxing bag    sometimes in work when someones talking negatively to me i feel like telling them what i think and just walking out     another thing that puts me at ease is knowing that if everything did ever become too much i could just walk out one day and end it all     sorry some of them may seem a lot worse than what they are but all of them are true    oh and to answer your question i like playing football and im fairly good at it but occasionaly someone who dosent like a bad challenge on them or whatever makes a comment like your shit or we and that really annoys me that they think they are better when i know they are not    ps ill never tell any of this to anyone  a proffesional because i dont want to be labled as crazy    the end hi guys long time no see i wish i could say i feel better and im much happier but id be lying sorry if this is in the wrong place i had two psych assesments since i was last on here the first said it was anxiety and the second said i had low self esteem they both recommended solutions drugs  therapy but to be honest i dont think that the diagnosises are correct but i feel like im fighting a losing battle the reason i think its more than anxiety  low self esteem  depression is for a variety of reasons  ive been sat in work recently sad at the fact that people i like are moving on i sit there thinking they all hate me and theyve given up on me whilst i love everybody i meet the best way to put it is two sentences kurt kobain put in his suicide note  theres good in all of us and i think i simply love people too much so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad  but since the age of seven ive become hateful towards all humans in general only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy only because i love and feel sorry for people too much i guess  which brings me on to my next bit i recently fell out with my parents coz my general feeling is that im living for everyone else not to feel sad i dont have a purpose and i feel life is pointless why should i stay alive to stop people feeling hurt so that they can move on and not give two shits 10 years from now i fell out with my parents two weeks ago then my mum messaged me crying etc telling me how much she loves me etc which i know is true and i went over to make her feel better and she instantly hugged me started crying kissing me and hugging me etc and as it was happening i felt nothing like i do everything for everybody else the psych dude said you focus too much on other peoples happiness and dont focus on your own at all but i dont care about myself  i sit in work and think about committing suicide in various ways and recently ive started just not caring like although i think about killing myself a lot i dont think im actively trying to do it i wont wear a seat belt etc its like im not trying to die but i dont care if i do or not it just hurts to care about people so much and to feel that so many people couldnt care less i know people have said i read into stuff too much and im too sensitive but i cant help it if someone starts acting differently towards you how are you meant to feel i mean i got other things i can think about i feel like suicide is a viable option at the moment i know people say ohhhh things get better bla bla bla but people only say that because they dont want to deal with the ballache that someone offing them is theres a saying that goes suicide doesnt end the pain it just passes it on to someone else and im sat here thinking  well if someone else what i feel maybe theyd understand why i want to do it  im altruistic to a fault  at the moment the reason im here is to stop people heartache and its not like i even feel compelled to do it for that reason i just feel like its the right thing to do but thats starting to wear thin  i guess its just hard to have moments of extreme energy with a constant underlying feeling of sadness and despair but these days it seems more despair and sadness like the things that made me feel better and not want to hurt myself dont seem to work anymore  id love to have someone say this is whats wrong with you 100 and not just stab at the cheapest options oh anxiety take these tablets oh low self esteem go to this free course run by someone who doesnt know and read everything in a book and couldnt care less in reality   i know theres something more wrong than anxiety and depression or low self esteem it cant be natural for someone to have such feelings of self destruction personal disregard self hatred love of others codependency on other peoples approval  acceptance  love  feelings  i literally feel trapped ive been wondering recently if i should try and get another cmht appointment and do something stupid coz only when you try and off yourself or if you do something extreme does anybody listen like i would never hurt a fly but maybe if i go in and i dunno take someone hostage then people would be like  this person needs help  i dont want to be another statistic on a website somewhere but at the moment i feel so helpless  to love everyone people and animals so much but to feel like youre loved so little is genuinely heartbreaking to me   sorry for rambling on i know everybody is probably going through tough times  i just cant vent in public without losing the few friends i have probably 0 now to be honest x i feel like im spamming the forum today but here goes   i hate being a person who cares how people feel who cares for animal and who likes everyone because all its caused me is sadness    when i like someone and they dont like me bad  sadness  when i read about people hurting animals  sadness  when i just want everyone to get along  sadness   when i read about people in the world getting killed or murdered  sadness   yesterday i saw a post about a girl whod killed herself because she shared a photo with her friends on a whatsapp group and one of her friends released it so she killed herself because she was scared of the abuse and hatred shed get and when i was scrolling it down the comments all the people were commenting were dumb bith killed herself over that natural selection and im thinking this world is a shithole  some 16 year old has ended her life and a lot of people are mocking her  some of the comments were disgusting  i genuinely felt despair and anger like i wanted to hurt the people writing the troll comments and inflict a bit of the fear and pain that the girl must have been feeling to end her life   the world is a joke thanks  i dunno how i feel x i feel like going on a spree but then i become one of the scumbags  i cant win i feel the same way nobody cares  people care for themselves and maybe there immediate family but thats it  they pretend to care but they dont genuinely care  people are inherently selfish  like you i try and show concern and care for others but we dont get it back x ok so i have a question and i dont want to upset anyone because i like to be liked and i like everyone so i dont want to upset anyone with this question  please dont read any further if you are in a crisis at the moment as it may make it worse im gonna try and leave some space so that you dont get to see the question if you dont want to  so please dont read any further if you dont want to discuss suicide                                                                                             the only thing that stops me from ending my life at the moment is the fact that i like to be liked and i like other people and the thought of other people thinking badly of me deters me even when im right on the edge i must be a really talented actor because nobody knows i ever feel this way ive got 30000 worth of debt ive done nothing with my life  i feel like im just existing obviously i said the one thing that stops me is the idea of people thinking badly of me and hating me for doing it but this is wearing thin now and its becoming easier to just not care about those feelings so can i ask does anyone here work in emergency services i want to know what first responders feel  think when they turn up at the scene of a suicide i know people might go ohh well its common knowledge its not going to be very pleasant etc but the reason i want to know is not to upset anyone but to try and put myself in their shoes because i know if i knew how they feel it would be enough to stop myself doing it because id feel guilty for even contemplating causing someone that much trauma  sorry if this doesnt make sense it does to me basically what use to stop me from doing it isnt there anymore so im trying to find other ways to make me stop doing it and i think if i knew how the person who turns up feels that would in turn give me a coping mechanism not to do it    also recently when im driving  i dont feel like its me driving i know i am driving but i feel like my body is like a cari feel like my mind is a person inside my body looking out and deciding what actions my body should do  anybody else get that   i appreciate the above is a distressing subject so i can accept this thread may not get any replies x thanks all for the replies   i definetly dont love myself  i love everyone and i want everyone to love me but it just dosent happen  i feel like ive wasted my life im 29 in september i hate turning on tvs and hearing about people killing animals and each other i hate how i feel sad all the time and then ill start talking to people and feel like happy energy for a bit and then it goes  i hate people expecting me to have done certain things or act a certain way coz im in my late twenties  im still a massive kid at heart  i love disney films and animals and sweets and that sort of stuff not alcohol  newspapers  mortgages etc i hate the way i look and i hate the way people are selfish  all people even the nice ones  nobody truly cares about anyone but themselves and their immediate families they think they do some of them propably genuinely believe they do but they dont every day i go to work and everyone jokes around and i try and make them laugh and everyone says to me you know everybody and everybody loves you they dont though im entertaining thats probably what they love  not the real me and inside i feel like shit but i cant tell people how i really feel because no one will accept it ive tried ooooooooooh hes too happy to have anything wrong probably just a bad day i get through every day by telling myself  if i have a really shit day i can always kill myself  and up until now ive had my own way of stopping myself doing it  but the urge to do it is getting stronger and my resilience to not do it is waning x noooooo  i just like it in there i feel relaxed not all people  but the majority    people always make really horrible comments   no one would know how i feel coz i always try and make people laugh and smile and talk lots and act like nothing bothers me but some of the comments i hear people say its no wonder people are afraid to talk and then when people with mental health show they are struggling in destructive ways  or even the most destructive ways you hear people saying ohhhh they should have told someone or spoken to someone  we would have helped what a crock of shit   sorry  rant over x i like to make people laugh and smile and try to get a long with everyone although sometimes ive been told im too much manic ott i always get called crazy nuts etc not in like a nasty way but it still hurts i just see myself as querky  ive flipped my shit a couple of times  one of them got me in trouble with the police which sucks because i use to be one and id never hurt anyone but now i feel like my perfect history is gone and ill always be tarnished with a black mark some people panic some people dont  if everyone panicked youd never hear of anyone dying of an overdose i can think of 100s  say it straight dude i dont mind i appreciate your responses but panicking whilst im doing it or upsetting some hospital staff braise they have to deal with another od doesnt change how i feel about it x thats the same problem i have  the only people who truly get me are people on here that i dont know in person  its horrible to have people  empathise so much be so far away i feel super alone alone coz no one day to day gets me and the people who do are hundres or thousands of miles away and ive never met them x so today i had the bandages taken off from my otoplasty ear pinning surgery and i got to see what they looked like  which was horrible because for the last 10 years ive blamed my ears for a lot of things not socialising as much as i should turning down opportunities to do things asking girls i liked out on dates etc basically everything and then today i got the realisation that if i get the ears done and i still feel the same way  it was just a scapegoat and ive wasted my time   my ears look okay better than they were they still a bit swollen so i wont see the proper end result for like 8 weeks  i feel kind of low though because i dunno ive fixed it but it hasnt really changed anything  i guess when you have a perception of yourself for so long you cant see past it like if someone tells you your ugly  stupid for long enough u start believeing it yourself and even living up to it to some point like a self fullfilling prophecy   im gonna have to buy a lot of nightnurse coz theres no way i can sleep the normal way on my ears ill have to lie on my back and without night nurse ill never sleep hmmmmmmm   i know what youre saying  you wear your heart on your sleeve so if you feel sad you show it  i know you probably dont understand this but i envy you  im a chameleon in the sense i would never let others know how im feeling i want them to know but i cant how upset that would make them so i go around performing and making people laugh and smile  you know that saying the happiest  funniest people are often the saddest definetly agree with that  i fake that everything is okay though  but deep down its killing me  i think most people just arnt aware of how shit life is i get through every day by thinking to myself well at least if i have a really bad day i can kill myself and i dont think ill ever get to the point where i could speak to anyone because last time i got sent for psych evauluation i was all nice etc to make the people who were doing it feel at ease coz i didnt want them to be scared  worried about me  it took me 14 years to tell my gp  sorry i went off on one there  i did have a purpose to that story but i cant remember  maybe when youre not a client anymore she isnt bound by proffesional boundries and you can keep in contact informaly and be friends  or you could stay feeling as you do and you can keep seing her i know i shouldnt say this but i often get tempted when i go see my gp just to sit in front of the door and refuse to let anybody else in the only reason i dont is becuase i know id prob get sectioned or we or shed never see me again or because shes a locum she covers shed never come back tt i really wanna follow her home so when she goes on maternity i can walk by and hope to randomly see her x god this is going to end badly for me   and i feel bad for admitting wanting to hurt anyone  but its the truth so everyone knows me as happy go lucky i get called crazy nuts off your head but in an affectionate way because of how i am  i say stupid things that seem okay to me but strange to other people im loud and usually the centre of attention i get away with saying things other people wouldnt say and people let me off because they know theres no malice or ive got peoples best intentions at heart im always laughing and trying to make people smile this is what everybody else sees apparently and yet i feel terrible almost all the time  id like to think family  friends would know when someones putting on a front  but maybe im just very good at it  i feel like everybody feels like im friends with everybody  but i feel ridiculously alone and what make it worse is when ive told people  they tend to withdraw and keep their distance are we destined to be alone for everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  also i gotta have a telephone assesment with primary mental health care team coz i got refered by my gp again even though i dont think counselling works anyone done one of these is it the standard do you think about killing yourself do you harm yourself etc interviews  that makes u feel even worse than we already do x so i lost two really good friends who i told about mental health and i decided to come off citalopram as i feel thats what caused people to start hating me recently my mum was speaking to me and started crying and when i asked her what was wrong she told me that my baby sister had told her shed been raped but was too afraid to tell anyone about it now where i was thinking about killing myself my only thought is to find out the persons name she wont say and end his life  that is my sole purpose i dont care about the rammifications or about going to prison  genuinely  people like him need to be eradicated my sisters petrified to go out now and i feel ive failed as her brother i feel exactly like this and im 26    i also feel like this about growing old    i also find myself getting really upset thinking that i will never ever go to primary school secondary school basiclly anything thats happnened in my past again   i treat people with respect and try and be nice  kind  to people but i feel 70 of the world are misrable  balshy twats who try and walk all over you and do what they want    its weird coz although i fear death knowing that if it all gets too much i can just kill myself  is what puts me at ease further to this i feel like you knowing that i am not the only person who feels like this  i have to say i find things like this interesting weve never met probably have completely different life stories and yet we fear the same thing   its like with ocd although everyone has different querks they do there are thousands of other people who do exactly the same thing  so from the time i was a kid ive done various things like washing my hands a lot being obsessesed with symmetry and doing things a certain amount of times 3 and i didnt think any thing of it i just did it because uhmmm i didand i dont do any of them anymore turns out they are all symptoms of ocd and there are thousands of people doing exactly the same  how does that even happen what makes the brain go  im really stressed about this job interview i know ill wash my hands for the next hour with bleach haha   i guess what im saying is although you feel alone like i do   and even though you may have people around you you cant talk to them because you dont want to scare them or you feel they will be dismissive i can promise you there are lots and lots 100s of thousands who feel the same right now even though im like you and people tell me enjoy life  otherwise you will look back wondering what if  i hate thay saying i guess its true dosent change the fact that i keep missing out on opportunities because i always think people are judging me   all id say even though i ignore the advice myself is when you get an opportunity to do something or try something just do it  and youll probs be happy you did  right  this post has got wayyyyy to self indulgent   finally  apologies admins for use of the word twt in my last post i hadnt realised id written that until i looked back on this thread just now heyyyy helena  uhhmmm i keep sneezing my head feels like its gonna explode and i wake up at like 2  3 every morning  i also been acting a bit manic and i dunno if its withdrawal ive always been pretty manic but to the point know where people are saying im slightly concerned for u also ive been thinking of ending my life a lot and ive been getting frustrate at people not responding to me instantly like on txts etc  like i want instant sort of acknowledgement i dunno which of these are withdrawal an which are me  i got punched in the side of the head at football as well so im feeling even more despair than i usully do  thanks for asking xxx ok so im  quite energetic and i like talking to people  and making jokes and id say i need constant attention people say that ive got a similar manner to robin williams so like manic and expressive but it does my head in because i try and make people  feel at ease and laugh and now i got people saying they worry about me and im over the top and like too much sometimes which makes me feel terrible about myself and how people percieve me  my citaloprams up in like 4 days and im thinking ill just stop it  but it dosent seem to have helped at all  ok i dont get massive kicks of adrenaline and at first it stopped the thoughts of ending my life but now  they are back and whereas before i had feelings of guilt for my family now i dont what could happeb if i just stop taking cit  im annoyed at my gp aswell because ifeel she lied to me about ohhh citalopram has least side effects but nothing about strugglin to come off them cold it annoys me because i like her but i feel ive been betrayed and i wanna go in tommorow and kick off  but then shell hate me  help x i just feel like having people i like say you can be pretty intense  i worry about u sometimes hurts i feel like a weirdo for just being myself and liking people  i love my gp but she dosent care for me  how cud she  she sees 100s of people  and she got her own  problems  she knows i found a lump and i was meant to go and have a downstairs exam but i cant go coz im naturalyl shy  having someone i like examining down there could make for more embarresment so my only option is to go cold turkey hi all  thanks for replying  i just cant shake the feeling that people only care because they are supposed to or because doing it makes them feel better about themselves ive always tried to care and help people when they need it  see if people are ok etc ive gone searching around houses when i was driving home and realised someone had left their car lights on or at the train station when a woman at the top of the stairs had a pram i carried it down for her and i use to think i like helping people but since ive started taking citalopram ive started to think clearer i feel apathy  and looking at it through my new logical mindset maybe im not a caring person  maybe i do these things so i can manipulate people to show gratitude and appreciation so i can feel better about myself and my life this would make sense as ive always tried to please people and be liked i just feel other people dont really care for example a gp is a caring proffesion and my gp seems like a nice person she went into a caribg proffesion  but if i ended my life hypothetical  i promise and she got to hear about it  do you think shed care nope  shed prob try and remember what i was like for two seconds then  next patient  only person who truly cares for me is my kitten  no agenda  well other than food just affection and love  i think the reason it hurts is because i gain unhealthy attachments to people who show comcern  line manager in work certain friends and now my gp  i went like 4 thursdays in a row to speak to her  shes the one i first told about my feelings shes the one who sent me for psych assesment shes the one who gave me citalopram  ive overdosed so i can speak to her again  it hurts tho because i dont think she truly cares shes just doing her job  i wish i knew why i feel like this x awwww bee u replied  iiiiiiii feel a little better  stillll longing to speakkk to people like ive got thw urge to meet the people on this forum  im such a weirdo lol x bumblebee when i get replies on this forum or get acknowledgment or praise  my stomache has like butterflies and i get that feeling of relief u get when uhmmm like when ure worried aboit something and it all works out ok or like when ure feeling down and u think about ending your life and it gives u that like peace of mind ahhhh feeling  it annoys me as i wasnt starved of attention when i was younger so i dunno why i feel like that xxx i feel i care i just feel no one else does  x ji know what your saying  i dont want to be seen as vulnerable but i want to be cared about and looked after im genuinely just a big kid  i feel so out of place  having a job etc  i just want to play computer games and have fun  im 6ft2 and wirey athletic and sometimes people pick fights with me and i sort of argue back and stick up for myself but im thinking in my head why cant people just be nice  breaks my heart the way people treat me  each other sometimes  like yobs who hurt animals and post videos online  why   i just feel like im putting on a front to survive in grown up world but mentaly im just a big kid and i want someone to hold my hand  god i hate who i am  the way the world is and how ill equipped i am to survive in it i always stick around hoping things get better and they never do  i feel like people just trying to keep me around because its considered sad that a young person wants to end their life  when im 60 and i feel the same way no one will care because i will have had a good run bla bla bla x i thought citalopram would be the magic pill that would make me feel free  now i feel similar to before but i feel like im poisoning myself with a drug that my body is going to become dependent on and god knows what other side effects it had  how old are u teddy bear awwww that sounds awsome  i use to play counter strike and im awsome with an awp sniper rifle boommm headshot  im in work  i feel well depressed now lol x helena1 hello   you alright   well i was on a week trial and when i took that i thought it was working but now further in i feel the same as i did before it  then i got given a months supply like two weeks ago and for first few days i tool 1 a day as i was told then i started taking two  then one day last week i took 5 now im back to taking one again  i know i shudnt take more than prescribed but immmmmm longing to seee my gp  ive taken like 3 weeks worth in like 5 days  id tell her how i feel but it would freak her out and maybe shed refuse to see me  shes a locum as well so im scared shes gonna leave  i tried to find her on facebook but i cant  i wudnt add her just find her so if she did change surgeries i could follow x  side effects wise i went from not being able to get sexualy excited to being the other way around the tinglig and numbness have gone but i am apathetic which i belive is a side effect  and i still feel sleepy yeahhh but i think i love her  i just want to be around her   nope i wasnt inappropriate but i just want to tell her how i feel  sometimes i get tempted to injure myself so i can see her shed know because ive gone from not visiting at all over 15 years to turning up like 6 times in the last 9 weeks  all on a thursday the only day she works   i know and i try and keep ton it  i feel trapped if i come off it ill go back to feelibg a bad as i did if i stay on it might not help and i may have serious long term issues    awwww thats good  i dont see much of u unless ure moderating my posts which is pretty much all of them  xxx like on the film elf when hes eating the cotton wool nmmmmm tasty lol  whats worst that can happen  i feel no anxiety at all  i think its almost impossible to od on citalopram x i relate to this a lot  i feel that i could have written that post  the nostalgic bit kills me i think to myself ill never have a first job again ill never go to primary school again ill never see this person again ahhhhhhhh its horrible unfortunetly i dunno whats wrong with either of us but take solace in knowing theres probably loads like us im gonna take it for 2 weeks and see if i feel any different  and if i dont ill just stop and bin em x hey all   ive googled this quite a bit but never really found the answer i was looking for so i thought id ask the lovely people on mental health forumnet   i was prescribed 20mg citalopram weeks dose to start with to trial and although i know theres sometimes side effects i was just wondering if it felt normal to not know what your feeling   the main side effects ive had is lethargy  really tired aching my head feels kind of fuzzy but its the feeling one thats playing with my mind i dunno what im feeling before i would be feeling down  sad or anxious now i dont feel anything like i feel like i want to be sad but i cant s its payday for me today and im usually really happy but i dont feel happy i just feel nothing also when i try to think about things eg memories or thoughts of doing stuff i struggle they dont come as easy for example when i use to think about ending my life it would give me a sense of relief now i struggle to hink about it and when i do i just think  oh  nothing more which is good but when i try and think of good things that have happened i struggle and when i do they dont really make me smile its just oh yeah that happened i also feel like its dulled my fight or flight so like yeasterday i was playing football and somone had a go at me and usually my muscles would sort of tense up my breathing would change and id get this strange sensation you know when adrenaline kicks in and yeasterday i was just meh i feel like its turned me from being hypersensitive  into not being able to really feel anything  anyone else have any experience of this plz xxx i feel like a dog that has been neutered x ahhhhh    so frustrating   i go and see gp about how im feeling gp refers for psych assesment they say youd benefit from primary mh care and give me details to get counselling and i dont need gp referral  great i think so i ring the number and the woman is incredibly rude and says you do need a gp referral so go back to them  we cant do anything and anyway all the courses weve got are during the day  and you work so theres nothing for you so i phone my employee assistance and speak to a cousnellor who arranges for me to see one in person we get 6 sessions i go to the first session last night and she says if its ok with you im going to contact your gp as im a little concerned well it cant be that concerning because i passed a psych assesment and also im not getting dragged away  also annoys me that nobody will tell me what the hell they are writing  blah  time to give up  or take up mma and smash peoples faces in hi dude  i feel better since i gave myself an end it date like really euphoric  i saw u didnt another no show at court mate  dw about it though  it will sort itself out its how i feel anyway  things like this just make me not want to resist the urge im not guinea pig doing experiments that you can name secret notes on  im a person a human being and their observations could help me know how to go against what im feeling  if i went in their and threatened someone i bet theyd tell me just lucky im not that type of person well atm xxx hi jack  i can relate to everything your saying thats exactly how i feel work colleagues make jokes in jest  and i take it personally i also worry about my future and what i want to do  i keep changing jobs because i dont think its right for me or ill be stuck in a job i hate for all my life and then when i look back ive achieved nothing i also compare myself to people of the same age eg most of my friends are married with kids etc  unfortunately i dont know how to fix the problem but maybe u can take solace in the fact there are other people who feel the same hi mate  after years of not doing it i did a lovely gp referee me for psych assesment who in turn refered me to primary mh services  great i thought so i ring the number the course is full and i need a gp referral and the onln course they got is at 10 in the morning i work   i feel palmed aside now im even more motivated to kill myself but out of spite so the local mental health services get investigated into the failings of preventing my death  x am i actully mentaly ill its hard to say without a proper diagnosis i know what i feel and what ive said on here is true and i self harm quite regularly i also think about death a lot but sometimes i feel like i dunno that im not but i think i am if you get me   also is thinking about hurting other people part of anxiety disorder like an urge  this bothers me because i think of myself as someone who gets along with others and these thoughts would usualy bother me but not at the moment im thinking its to do with getting people to feel how i feel    also whats the difference between generalised anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder i post because  i feel alone day to day  and with this forum at least i know there are people who can relate and dont judge me  i do listen to advice i just dont think anything suggested so far would work in my situation can i ask with regards to a psych assesment am i allowed to see what was written and if yes how do i go about it   i lied with regards to a few answers because i found them to embarrassing to answer or because i feared the consequences so i kind of messed up a little also they asked me if i ever felt invincible i thought that was a bit random   i still feel the way i feel before i saw them and still having the same thoughts  is it a go i see about the report or    thanks x i actually phoned the receptionist back to tell them id lied about certain aspects and i got told to phone back tommorow to speak to the lady  i dunno what difference it will make to the assesment if at all apparently there wasnt much in the details of my psych report when the lady checked the system she said its still ongoing  soooo im not really sure what that means  also im panicking about what to tell the psychiatrist tommorow  shes really nice and i feel bad i lied i was told by my solicitor that if they disclosed i had mental health issues to police i was more likely to be prosecuted so i was scared im being sent to n wales with work for three days in feb and im staying in a hotel and im kind of hoping my thoughts of ending my life will not be as bad by then  its just so tempting because its so far away and i dont know anyone there thanks to everyone for their time in responding with informative  warm replies when i know you all have your own worries  issues you are all very very nice people  x so recently ive been thinking about how ive failed at life  im 27 now and i feel stuck in my situation financial  work  personal i use to get myself through it by going if it ever gets really bad you can just kill yourself and it will be over nice eh im fed up of not knowing whats wrong with me  gps in general dont seem to care or just label everything anxiety which im not denying  i do have anxiety and i dont want to have anything but i know i do  because the things i think  do cant be normal i was self harming recently so embarrasing and even though im really mild mannered and like getting along with people i hate the way some people treat others rude obnoxious ive been thinking to myself  the next person who is rude to me is getting thrown to the floor and their head stood on i drove to a hospital on christmas eve and just sat outside in a secluded part of the hospital playing with things that could harm me i left them to one side and went in to the hospital to walk around christmas day i was back and ended up seing a police van and going up to the officer and asking for directions i know they say people who talk about suicide are looking for attention etc and maybe i am but i genuinely think new years day this year would be a good date to go 01012015 its got a nice round figure to it and at 27 id say its a good age  not young  not too old  blah i havent told anybody about the self harming because its embarrasing  i havent told anybody about wanting to kill myself because my step brother tried to kill himself so anything other than the act itself is being an attention seeker apparently  also whats the famous saying dont tell anybody your problems because 80 of people dont care and the other 20 are glad you have them  i dont want to tell people about it  im embarrased by it i still want to do it though  all i wanted to know was what was wrong with me to put a name to a condition because im certain i have something with the things im thinking  i hate the way i look i hate the way im perceived i always think people are judging me in a negative way i hate how people are rude  even though id consider myself mild mannered recently ive been thinking of hurting people who i perceive as rude i wanted to get pinnoplasty surgery but i cant afford it i dont like socialising outside of work  football because i feel people are juding me or are going to mock me  put me on the spot i have been into town or socialising maybe 3 times in 8 years as a result ive lost my friends that i had and on top of that i dont date because i dont like going out i use to have ocd querks washing hands symmetry repetitions but i dont anymore i think about suicide alot i hate the idea of growing old and i constantly think to myself this has happened it will never happen again for example going to primary school on my first day etc i also hate growing old because i feel like people think you should be married by 28 have kids by 30 etc when i  speak id say im perceived as energetic and hyper  talkative but by the end of the day or sometimes minutes later i feel low again   i also hate when people say suicide is selfish  selfish is expecting me to hang around even though i hate my life so that other people dont have to feel bad or sad because i killed myself people seem to think that we should be content just being alive i cant wait to hang around and watch the only people in the world i have die of a heart attack old age heyyy thanks i just find doctors in general unhelpful i wish my family was as supportive as you but due to my brothers past instance of trying to kill himself  anything other than an attempt would just be seen as attention seeking im just tired of life in general the way people treat each other the news every day is mass murders rapes etc and then my life sucks on top of that and it just seems like a lost battle to exist sometimes i feel like i am just existing for no other purpose than to exist   nice to hear your son hasnt self harmed since and is doing well for himself  im just sceptical of counsellors  gps etc they do what they do because it pays well i dont think they have any genuine interest in the people they see id be another name in an appointment book   thanks both im concerned about you too and would like to try to talk you out of this too i dont want you to act on these feelings like many others on here ive been where you areand i know that our words mean little because you dont believe that there is any hopebut we all know that things can and given time and the right help will change for you           everyones words mean a lot but again whilst everybody knows how im feeling everyone is so far away and im still alone in my every day life i wont ask for help because i see it and i know other people see it as a sign of weakness  and i feel as if im faulty as a human being already                you mention attention seekingthat old chestnutwell liked by the uninformed when it comes to describing mental health symptoms and suicidality we all know it as a cry for help we dont think you are attention seeking and we take what you say seriously           i do hate the term attention seeking but all i can think of is what people think is only relevant whilst im still around after that it means nothing                id love you to be wrong about your doctorbut some do behave in this way he is misinformed and not knowledgeable about mental health find another doctor if you possibly can           ive been to a few and they are all the same                i know what you mean the rehearsed speech runs to a script almost and the intentions are clear its better to talk to people who are real and who will listen and respond honestly sometimes we can do that here we know youre at the end of your tether and youve had enoughbut yes we too want you to keep talking to usbecause we want to talk you round and keep you with us           again you probably know how im feeling best but your all so far away and although reading comments here help as soon as i go back to my life  i feel the same again                dont bother with that then talk to us or decide for yourself to call someone who can help you  well maybe there is something wrong thats something you have in common with a lot of us who are sat online of an evening instead of out socialising its undeniably hard and lonely but dont lose sight of how things can change           i cant see there ever being a change i just feel like im existing so as not to inconvenience other people and upset them  but once those people are gone  or im at an age where dying isnt seen as a tragedy in my 50s onwards nobody would care really  i genuinely see irrelevance in existing  we can accomplish amazing things in our lives and then one day we die and it dosent matter 100 years from now nobody will remember anyone  some times i get tempted to go on a crime wave and do whatever i want and then the following day end it all hi cherbear   i know you all care and youve all been through it and i apprecite it but your all usernames on a forum and so far away and when it comes to day to day life im still even with all the support and positivity on here alone i know you know how im feeling so i know youll understand when i say that even with all the reassuring comments at the moment i still feel as low as ever i know you said you are not in a great  place yourself so i hope you do get to a place where you feel happy all the time maybe when you get married next year well i suppose whether its correct or not is down to whos reading it or watching the video again everything anyone says is open to interpretation correct it is about philosophy however deeper than that its about someone whos having trouble in with life due to philosophy i decided not to comment so other people could help him if that makes sense i feel like it was somone elses thread ive said my piece and now im discussing philosophy  religion with you which is fine  just not on someone elses thread i feel like weve hijacked it and taken it away from what the original person was asking but maybe its just me thats why i used the word everything  it applies to both religious and science equally  i feel you have the need to have the last word so  go hey cally   thanks for the message glad to hear you are managing to turn your life around my problem is i struggle to tell anyone its a long story but ive always felt like ive got to put on a show for people and be the joke teller funny guy makes other people feel better  there was this girl in work and she said to me you remind me of robin williams  youre so funny and when you talk your really expressive and exciteable  and i was like haha uhmm thanks  and then she added on but even though robin williams seemed really happy he was actully very low you dont feel low do you and she said it in a jokey way  and i was dying to say well actully yes thats how i feel but if i had i would have made her freakout so instead i just cracked a joke again  i dont know what it is but i cant tell people because i dont like being vulnerable  which is why i dont go out to social situations and why i feel like i feel  hope you do defeat your demons from the sounds of you im confident you will   to everyone whos commented thank you im gonna stop using the site for a bit because finding people who are so alike and can relate is great but then having to go back to day to day where nobody can relate and nobody knows is so depressing and i feel more alone than ever  thanks again x hey my company has a employee assistance program with legal advisors counsellors etc so i phoned them up because i was feeling really anxious i always think people are thinking badly of me me  judging me so i speak to someone and we go through various things and why im thinking them and then we get to my preoccupation with growing old she said we all grow old and die and i said i dont fear death im anxious about getting old and not being young anymore i think its to do with people expecting you to conform to being serious etc you cant be hyperactive  ott  querky or your seen as an oddball  anyway it got on to her saying something about suicide and how did i feel about it and i said i think about it all the time i sometimes think about killing myself now so technically id always be in my mid 20s even that sounds old but i dont think id ever do it because people would be going oh did you hear about so and so killing himself how selfish what a horrible person he was to do that to his family although technically id be dead so why worry right and she said your not feeling like that now are you because we are required to act on it if you intend to harm yourselfs  others  feel suicidal now the service is confidential but from the details i provided they could easily know who i am  anyway this scared me so i said no i dont feel like that anymore even though i do  kind of a stupid service if it scares you into lying about how you feel anyway my question is drumroll who could they possibly have called  everytime someone looks at me my fight or flight goes nuts and i can feel my body getting pumped up god help anyone who turns up at my door hi  i dont think the service you have encountered would be trying to scare you they will be trying to ascertain your state of mind and will have a duty of care to get help if they think you are at risk you may just have to face the repercussions of your phone call but i would hope that your health is a greater priority to you over your job  but they did scare me  so much so that i didnt actully tell them how i really felt its not my job im concerned with its being labeled as having mental health problems  it might be good to consider some therapy outside of the work environment  i struggle to make phonecalls and talk about it i wouldnt be able to speak to someone in person  if you are feeling suicidal i would recommend you get help from a professional speak to your gp etc also samaritans are there to call if you are really having a difficult time  i find it hard to speak to anyone tried speaking to gp but they are very sort of oh right about it and even if i did speak to her i wouldnt be able to tell her the extent of my thoughts  do you know where your fear of getting old stems from  i dont know maybe its to do with i like to talk but im quite random so as you get older that would probably make me seem strange and also physicly you start to decline also theres the fact that the world seems made for young people  did you know that life begins at 30 jokes aside you are as young as you feel and physical ageing should not be a cause for such distress  genuinely i thought 23 was old im 26 now  i cant see me living past 40 anyway  take care and seek appropriate help  i genuinely feel alone this forum is all i have for telling people how i feel  thanks for your reply  i appreciate it thanks for your reply but i feel so anxious calling now and i wouldnt be able to speak freely without worrying about being contacted via police  hr department we  hello  can someone help   im 23 male got a job normal etc but i was wondering if anyone can help me   i have ocd tendencies and go through phases of different things excessive hand washing symmetrycounting whilst doing certain things and so on i get depressed quite often and one of the main reasons for feeling depressed is with time i feel like i just exist but im not doing anything with my life and i also think back to different things i have done for example being in school or playing a five a side tournament at the reebok arena with certain people then when those people move on i get depressed knowing that the experience is over and im never going to relive that experience with those people again and its depressing   next i want to show you a clip of something  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv2tj3a7x9gle   its from a movie called tangled and i like being treated like the horse is being treated but again its not sexual s so basicly what i want to know is how messed up am i and what could that stem from i had a normal childhood and had parentsfamily who cared for me so why do i feel more comfortable being treated like a child because children dont have any responsiblities i dunno im quite a childish person in that i am very energetic talk endlessly about random stuff   i had serious head injuries when i was younger multiple but surely that cant be responsible for things that i think about now   sorry i know your not a proffesional sorry i know you guys arnt proffesional but i thought you may know why people have certain tendencies also i think about suicide alot not that id ever act on it but i just think its nice to know if life ever got really shiti could just crash my car into a wall without a seatbelt and it would all be over   sorry to bore you\n",

      "doc: so im not sure if this is normal but i have been having serious doubts about getting married im only 23 and my fianc is 26 dont get me wrong i love him but i feel like i havent figured myself out yet and theres so much i want to do before getting married ive been thinking about what it would be like to be single be on my own and do the things i want to do yes i can do these things with my fianc but a part of me wants to experience things on my own is this normal to be feeling like this another part of it is my parents arent totally on board and its making me feel even more confused like are they right they dont think were right for each other and that we are completely different people they also think im too young to be getting married i love him and for the longest time thought i wanted to marry him but now i find myself asking if i really do any advice hello storm and welcome to the forum i am so sorry you are suffering with your anxiety and feeling so insecure   i know you say your boyfriend has never had to consider another person but when in a relationship people do need to consider each other and i think he should let you know if he is to be home late as it is only natural you are worry do not put all the blame on your anxiety as i think anybody would worry if a loved one was late or did not want to talk about the future i think without him realising it he is making you feel more insecure by these things it reminds me of my last relationship were i blamed myself for all my insecurities when it was him making them happen    are you having any therapy for your anxiety i feel it would really help you to be able to work through your fears with a therapist and you could do with the extra support too when the slightest thing goes wrong i feel like it is the end of the world and that i cannot cope when anything happens that upsets me the only way i can see it working is to kill myself i always feel suicide is my only option as i cannot see any way of things improving i can really understand how you feel when things go wrong as it seems we feel the same way    when a person has bpd they catastrophise which means they think everything is far worse than it is we cannot help it and we should not feel it makes us feel pathetic   when you have such worries i think the best thing would be to talk about them so you can be reassured that things are not as bad as they seem you have your cpn me and blueflames who are all here for you xx i do not think you sound selfish at all you just want to feel secure in your relationship and that is understandable i feel sad because i was with somebody who forgot my birthdays and was not affectionate and i know it feels so lonely but you love him and accept it i feel like that i have had so much therapy and tried every medication and am now on two yet i just crash if something upsets me and cannot cope at all hi guys thanks for the advice im just trying to ride out the first 46 weeks i think in the long run the pros out weight the cons as i feel so much better in myself since taking the med i think i even got anxious about the meds   to make me less anxious its nice now to realize im not alone i recently went to the doctor after months of trying to get the courage to go and she prescribed me paxil 20mg and i absolutely hate it paxil makes me feel sick my muscles feel stiff i get very dizzy i feel as if im going to pass out and i cannot sleep at night im going to make an appointment tommrow to get taken off this stuff i want to know if anybody knows what medicine will work for anxiety i want to try xanax my friend has been on it for awhile and she says it helps her another thing is ive had a migraine for 2 weeks now and that maybe why she prescribed me paxil i need help in knowing what works the best with few bad side effects  thanks quick question ive been having anxiety for over 6 months and recently i noticed when i get anxiety while talking to someone i feel overwhelmed i get angry fast like for instance  while at work a customer kept getting snappy at me and he did something to trigger my anxiety well as that happened i got angry and said somethings that i really do regret but i remembered as it was happening that i felt as i had no control it was like looking at myself from above i couldnt stop or just walk away it was like i was stuck   thats not the first time it has happened not at work thankfully but i felt the same way each time anyone ever felt this was or know what might be happening  thank you im writing this as im having a mild anxiety attack ive been suffering from anxiety for about 12 weeks im pretty much a control freak actually more ritualistic than control freak i have to have things done a certain way my way but its getting to the point were i cannot keep in control  anxiety i think has consumed my life its all i think about anymore and the more i think about it the worse i feel and the stronger the anxiety becomes    i need to see someone about this but i really dont know how to begin im too scared to see a doctor because everytime i think about going i get a panic attack so id hate to see what happens while im there and i dont have the patience for therapy plus the fact that i hate criticism but i think when i beat my fear i will start to be normal again i need some advise from someone who has been in my foot steps before i want to know what you did to overcome anxiety and fear    im planning on making an appointment for a physical i havent been to the doctor for a long time and while im talking to the doc ill mention my anxiety and see what happens then but i really dont want to go to therapy there is something about therapy that i get a bad feeling from   but anyway thanks for your time im actually feeling better after ranting on for a bit    thanks hello im looking for some help or advice for coping with anxiety   ive been having anxietypanic attacks for around 12 weeks now its been the hardest 12 weeks of my life just about everyday i get an attack out of the blue my heart starts to race i turn completely white my whole body gets entirely numb and i start to twitch feet hands sometimes my eye lids too ive tried breathing techniques cold towel over my face and counting    i cant take it anymore i work 2 jobs i got stuff to do but once that panic attack comes you can forget it i get wiped out once its over i feel weak and tired all i want is my normal self again    to give you an example of my anxiety   i was at a friends house a few weeks ago about 30 mins after getting there i start to feel a panic attack coming along so i try to fight it off without my friend knowing but it got way to strong for me so i told him get me a cold wet towel im having a panic attack right before he got me the towel it started to feel slightly different than normal i actually felt soo relaxed i put my feet out and crossed my arms while sitting in a chair then i put my head down and closed my eyes and started to count in my head as im doing that my friend started to see my feet twitching and he told me it sounded like i was having a hard time breathing so he yelled at his brother to dial 911 but not to call just yet i actually remember him talking to his brother about this as its going on then he nudged my shoulder and i looked at him and he asked if i was ok   then afterwards he said my face was very pale my lips were darker red and my legs were twitching really bad     that was my worst attack i have had it scares me thinking about it because it happened in front of my friends    has anyone felt really relaxed during a panic attack it seems very odd to me anyway im too nervous to see a doctor because the fear of them telling me its all in my head and thinking im some sort of drug addict looking for medication thats not what im after i just want to be normal again i hate fearing anxiety i just cannot get past it     i know what my triggers are i try to advoid them but i still get the shakes in my hands and feet all day i cant see it happening in front of my eyes but i can feel it    anybody have any advice for living and coping with anxiety        thanks and sorry for the long post hello audreyc and welcome to the forum i am very sorry you are struggling with your fears fears like this can strike at any time and can happen to anybody would you consider going to your doctor and asking for cognitive behaviour therapy this works on challenging such thoughts i feel it could be beneficial for you ive only accepted that i have social anxiety now and i dont really know what to do but its putting me down before i always ignored it or was in denial but now i feel weak because of it i realise its because of my low self esteem and lack of confidence like why am i afraid to say what i want when i want but then i also think theres more to it like fear why do i have to fake laugh and try make people want to be around me and then i torture myself and think that well people arent into being friends with me im not quick to make friends and when im uncomfortable i end up leaving since i dont want them to think even worse of me id say its all in my head but ive seen people be more friendly with my friend but not try as hard with me is it because they can sense my lack of confidence and wanting to be accepted i just need someone to talk to who understands what im going through and maybe even help because its quite depressing to feel low about myself its getting in the way of my ambitions what do i do   thank you i think its because of my social anxiety as well and recently because of everything ive held back its started to depress me i end up feeling so sad because if the issues i havent dealt with for a such a long time the fact i get shy around people and afraid to speak and just be me then this problem fits in with it as ill laugh at jokes when its not funny just trying to fit in if someone is being slyly rude i probably wont say anything to them ill only think about it in my head if someone is annoying me or being disrespectful id also find a way around it ive found its also made some of my relationships with others bitter because of the many little things theyve done but i dont confront them as im too nice or dont want to cause a fight and be upset so i end up bottling in emotions and sometimes i just blow up in the end over something small like an argument over something small i wont stand for my character and sometimes people end up targeting me and i feel like its all a lack of confidence and self esteem i dont know what to do i wish it was easy to just gain confidence and self esteem i dont know how to go on about it or anything and id really appreciate help or anyone going through the same as well maybe we can help each other because sometimes i feel so alone with my social anxiety problem and this   thank you hi i feel your pain on this one i also suffer with social anxiety which keeps me distant from people in my life while craving human intimacy forming some annoying antithesis that seems to rule my life    ive more or less reached my saturation point with feeling on the outside of social groups as such i am contemplating going along to a social group which a colleague has invited me to my social anxiety fuels my suspicion that this is just politeness rather than a genuine offer but hey they didnt have to invite me right my point is you have to make small steps towards your goalsif joining a group seems too much for now try developing the relationships you already have or try being nice or sharing small talk with a friendly stranger    unfortunately for people like us who have social anxiety the best way to develop confidence is to consistently try to connect with people and learn from our mistakesthink of it as a numbers game like salesin sales you have to ring 100 people before one will speak to you and another 10 speakers before you get a sale but that sale or friend if you contextualise the metaphor will be worth all of the weird looks and awkward heh heh hehs that people do while looking uncomfortable    in the meantime try to focus on what brings you joyrelief from your symptoms and try to build relationships online first if that is easier than speaking to people face to face but remember that people often act emotionally and their emotional state is likely not to have anything to do with you   i always had friends from infancy to uni but since uni when everyone went their separate ways ive really struggled to make friends im 27 now ive just started a new job and the anxiety is quite high but there are a couple of people who i think i get on with and others which i know i dontthe ones i know i dont get on with the ones i think i do which kinda fuels the anxiety but im just guna keep trying to plug away at itfriends is something i want so im not prepared to give up on it   hope this helps a bit oh yes i feel the same the waiting around and clock watching is so stressful i am like this each time i go out and just want to leave right away the only thing i can suggest is to try not to get up too early so you have less time to wait around i am sorry you have to go through this i can understand why you are thinking of marriage as all your cousins are married and it seems the next logical step in a relationship but i think marriage would be a big mistake for you your partner has let you down so many times and there has been occasions you have wanted to leave him i feel marrying him would not be in your best interests as it would not make the relationship any happier i think sometimes when we feel insecure we think marriage would help but it really would not i am sorry to sound negative but it just seems he holds you back and does not understand you and i feel you deserve so much better then that it really feels awful to have a low mood i can understand your struggle is there anything you could do as a distraction such as watching something or having a hot bath i try to distract myself when i feel low or i end up thinking very negative thoughts and feeling worse i will be honest here i feel your boyfriend is too immature to deal with your feelings i remember telling people in my past countless times what i needed when i was low and i was always ignored i know now that it is because i was not important enough you are a lovely caring person who has so much going for you but i do not think your boyfriend and friends are worthy of you how hard is it to listen and hug a person or say you are sorry they are hurting it is not hard if you can be bothered i have been reading your posts for a while now and feel your friends are too wrapped up in their own lives it is not like you are just moaning you have a mental health condition which is out of your control and will make you feel worse then other people to tell your partner you miss your mother and for him not to respond is so cold and lazy i felt angry when i read that as he should comfort you    i really hope my post has not upset you in any way i do get times were i feel anxious and i have a social phobia so you can imagine the anxiety that causes i am mainly low in mood rather then anxious i can understand you not wanting to take medication so maybe you could make an appointment with your doctor and ask to have cbt gentleflower i am really sorry your so called partner has been so abusive you are not lazy or dumb you are a loving mother and caring person who deserves to be happy i am thrilled you are going to ask him to leave as i feel he is the reason for a lot of your stress and worries you do not need him in your life you are strong to have coped with such anxiety without giving in and you do not need him hindering you we are all here for you it is so lonely not having anybody i also have no family or friends but i am lucky to have my partner i feel lonely when he is busy as i have nobody else you are taking all the right steps to change your situation i think you are being so brave opening your curtains is a big step as you are letting in light which can be hard to deal with if feeling down you are always welcome to talk to me this is so difficult to post as i feel everybody on here will hate me once i say this but here goes  when i was 18 i had a best friend who was 15 now i cannot believe i hung about with somebody so young as it feels really strange i did not see her as a child anyway we both never had boyfriends and started experimenting on each other she started it first and i was curious so carried on but now i am really worried i cannot remember if she was 15 or 16 and if she was 15 then surely i have broken the law i feel so worried and ashamed of myself i wish so badly that i could turn back time and never met her i worry about this every single day and when i hear all those reports about people who abuse children i am scared i will end up in jail i thought of going to the police but my partner thinks i am making a huge deal out of this and i have done nothing wrong he said it is only wrong if she was forced and as it was her idea she clearly was not i am just so worried every single day about this    i also understand if people will want me to leave this forum that is the worst mistake i have made in my life and i will leave if somebody asks me to i feel the same way english rose i love animals so much and hearing about cruelty breaks my heart i am really happy to hear you have a dog and how loved he is by you all personally i feel it is worth a try as you feel so bad anyway there is nothing to lose i take an anti anxiety medication and it takes the edge of things for me dont know what to do anymore i have 2 kids one has severe autism  im in constant pain plus depression anxiety  so much stress my dr doesnt know why im in constant pain  i have an appointment with a specialist but will have to cancel since i have no one to watch my kids

      "doc: hi i dont drop in here much but im really anxious about something wonder if anyone can help  for once i have something to be anxious about rather than just worrying over nothing but i really want to stop the anxiety getting out of control  i dont really have health anxiety until i hear doctors say the words i have no idea what this is then i have health anxiety because i assume it either a will never go away b will get worse c is such a rare disease doctors dont even think of it d is a serious disease they dont think id have but i do and im going to die  this time it is a rash it started with one spot about a fortnight ago then about ten days ago i got a heat rash style thing over my legs didnt worry about it at first then it started to get sore and itchy and spread across my legs took it to a walkin clinic where two nurses independently diagnosed insect bites infected with impertigo i used the cream they gave me but ran out and it had got worse and spread so i went to another doctor who told me to stop taking lamotrigine mood stabiliser immediately in case it was that otherwise he had no clue what it was he told me to go to a doc immediately if it got worse it did so i went to another dropin centre luckily there was a consultant there who specialises in epilepsy lamotrigine is also an anticonvulsant and told me straight away it wasnt a lamotrigine rash it was pityriasis rosea  a noncontagious viral infection another doctor at the same dropin confirmed this in the meantime the rash has spread across my legs bottom anus genitals chest back shoulders arms and stomach and its sore and itchy so i go to another doctor to get something to help with the discomfort this doctor declare every other doctor i have seen incorrect and tells me he has no idea what the rash is but its probably bacterial because its too red to be pityriasis rosea he gives me steroid cream and antibiotics   anyway  today i start a new job that i have been really looking forward to ive been feeling only slightly under the weather so i take my 15hr commute to my new job feel a bit weak when i get off the train but assume im just nervous get to the office where i feel like im going to throw up have to apologise to new boss and explain ive just taken an antibiotic and im feeling nauseas she lets me sit down for a while and do some reading rather than walk around the building doing a meet and greet but i run to the toilet to have diarrhoea then feel like energy just drains from me and get really dizzy i wasnt sure it was anxiety anymore so i had to apologise and explain i wasnt well enough and would have to go home less than an hour after arriving i was massively embarrassed and probably embarrassed myself more by being hugely apologetic and telling everyone how embarrassed i was they were really nice but i still worry they think im weird or flaky  so  the anxiety is now twofold firstly they dont know what this and i have no idea ifwhen its going to stop secondly my new colleagues have got a really bad first impression of me   by the way if i describe my rash in google it comes up with hiv this is why you should never use google  do you think i need to be worried how could i look at this in a way that it will seem less like the end of the world i think im mostly embarrassed about work rather than anything else i can to some extent relate to this and i also suffer from anxiety  i have a deep fear of dependence and whenever i feel in the least bit dependent on someone i freak out i think there are two reasons for this  firstly i think it hits my self esteem and i start to think less of myself because my selfconcept is based around fierce independence and doing everything singlehandedly etc and secondly i dont think ive ever had a relationship i didnt think was temporary although usually i think i will end it  but if i feel like i have any dependency then i assume they will end it instead and usually because of some perceived flaw in me  years ago i was in a relationship where i felt much more strongly than usual for the person i was with when i noticed some distance come between us i woke up one day and simple didnt love him anymore i thought i just dont have any feelings for him and i need to split up with him so i phoned him up dick move wed been together over a year to split up with him and then the moment i started talking i started questioning myself and i wasnt sure anymore later on i felt deeply in love with him again but that was once hed started the process of splitting up with me not imagined he actually said hed be splitting up with me in a few months and yes i did try to leave but i was having a horrendous time in other parts of my life and found it difficult i then found myself staying with him but at the same time not wanting to so i would for instance spend a day with him as my boyfriend but then choose to sleep on the couch at night because i didnt want to be near him i also found i would get obsessed with anything but the relationship  i got obsessed with tv shows with word puzzlesand i mean obsessed to the point i could think of nothing else   the best way this has been explained to me is that its basically a very complicated attachment style i think they technically call it disorganised all insecure attachments are based around a fear of abandonmentrejection and they affect the way you act interpersonally they are also the cause behind social anxiety some people feel insecure so they cling to stop the other leaving other people feel insecure so they distance themselves from their partner so as not to get too attached some people do both i tend to do both but i err towards distancing distancing includes thinking about your partners flaws and feeling emotionally detached from them etc  it doesnt really matter whether you tend to cling distance or do both it sounds like youre feeling a mixture of both at the end of the day its the same fear which is that you will split up  or more accurately what you think will happen if you split up  there are a few practical things you can do 1 work out what story you are telling yourself  what do you actually think will happen if this relationship doesnt work out do you think it will say something about you personally will it lower your self worth or perhaps you think you cant go it alone or perhaps you think you will not have a similar relationship with other people once youve worked out your story remind yourself that these are just thoughts they are not reality you might try practicing mindfulness you can find free courses on the internet to help you get used to observing your thoughts without necessarily taking too much stock in them 2 increase your self worth  all insecurities are based on low self worth if you can increase your self worth you can beat your insecurity altogether ignore everyone who says you just need to love yourself more because thats an empty phrase that is impossible to apply instead do practical things such as being more assertive before you enter a social situation remind yourself that you are important  just as important as anyone in the room  and that you deserve to be treated as if you are just as important as anyone else that includes your emotions which are always valid  i have difficulty with that part but you just have to work on it learn to expect that others treat you with the same importance they treat themselves and others at first it will feel unnatural and it will take a lot of practice but the more you practice the better you will get its a long journey but its worth it the more you act as if you have self worth the more your self worth will increase because of the feedback you get from others and the very fact you get used to the idea 3 dont let your boyfriend help you too much dont take that the wrong way he sounds lovely and its very important to have someone around who understands you and is compassionate like he is but explain to him you want to be more independent because you will need to be for your future life together and you need to learn to be by yourself maybe you could plan it together so that you do things by yourself bit by bit and through gradual exposure prove to yourself you are ok alone im just so frustrated today my anxiety problems have caused the worst fatigue all year and i can barely function i managed to get into the office for half a day on tuesday then go to therapy yesterday morning and the office in the afternoon i wake up this morning and i feel like ive done three marathons this has happened so many times over the years and im so sick of it  i do put it all down to stress but mostly i put it down to feeling empty all the time all the time ive realised that ive spent years thinking that if i just achieve a b or c then i wont feel empty anymore so ive been pushing myself but im completely embracing the idea that no level of achievement will take away the emptiness for me ive realised it isnt a lack of achievement that makes me feel so hollow inside  but the problem is that i keep thinking  ok i feel empty thats the problem so all i have to do now is live a fuller lifegain fulfilmentmaybe im lonely should i hang out with more people maybe im not being self loving enough lets try self compassion and be really nice to myself and then maybe i wont feel so empty  does not budge cannot feel less hollow its like im completely unfillable and that hollowness is what makes every day feel like an endurance task and everyday feeling like an endurance task is what makes me so so so tired and drained  im just really angry its so frustrating its like im looking the problem head on  i feel empty  and im trying to do different things to feel less empty but fuck if i know what this emptiness wants me to do i dont know what the problem is so how the fuck do i solve the problem if i try and imagine what i want  what would make me happy i generally just think something like i want to go to sleep or i just dont want to feel ill anymore  i think vaguely that i am missing a sense of warmth in my life and self compassion then seems the right route but its like i just dont understand warmth i dont know how to get it i dont know how to provide it to myself i dont know what things outside of me provide warmth either  its just a rant sorry im just so tired and frustrated it feels like i missed some vitally important memo in life and i dont understand how to be a human being  it feels a bit better to shout into the ether thanks for reading thank you for your support guys  i emailed my boss to say i was going to leave my job yesterday she knows ive been having difficulties and she knows how much i dont want to let her or my colleagues down and that this is a difficult decision for me she was really nice about it  straight afterwards i was feeling a bit of panic and lack of direction but in the evening i went out to walk to the shop and thought about how throwing away responsibility like this frees me up to just be  theres no pressure nothing i have to do nothing im supposed to do so i can just lay back and wait for some kind of impulse inside me to tell me what i want to do  as i was thinking about that i did get a sense of warmth and fulfilment and when i looked around me the world had suddenly come into focus it was a bizarre feeling i have been saying for the last decade that i feel like i want to wake up i feel distanced and removed and not able to connect or engage with anything like the world is constantly hazy in that moment it was like all the details came back to life and the world looked intensely beautiful and clear  sorry for all the touchy feeliness but it was quite a strong sensation that i suddenly felt alive again it reminded me of when i was in my early 20s and i did a bit of stand up it wasnt really the stand up itself that made me feel alive but the feeling of being on a train coming back from godknowswhere at godknowswhattime and thinking im really living im really doing something with my life   i think at some level i always knew this was what was missing  the feeling that i was driving my own life according to my wishes  but i always felt that it would be selfish i didnt want to let anyone down i wanted to be responsible and anyway my dreams are all things that are real dreams you know i want to write and make films id like to do some freelance journalism so that i can go around and meet people find out about their lives and write their stories what drives me is my curiosity and i want to be able to follow that curiosity and find the stories i want to tell  i just always believed i should be doing this outside of work and i have done that too i do some contract work as a scriptwriter but throwing off the shackles of real work temporarily might help me to focus solely on doing whatever it is i fancy doing to my hearts desire even for a couple of months i have some savings just to lift myself back up trying to do things when im exhausted and forcing myself to stay in work just isnt realistic at this point gaining some fulfilment and happiness from life is the best thing for me and when i feel a little more buoyed and a little more excited about life again then i will return to work  im not against doing boring things things i dont want to do or responsibilities we all need to do that but i think ive done too much of that and too little of anything else i think i need to play for a while until my strength is back and then go back into life with a better balance between work and play im really struggling again with the amount of stress i can feel all of the time everything hurts  muscles and joints etc  and i feel weak and unable to concentrate   i think im just really struggling to keep up with life so i always feel like im failing i can barely sleep at night then dont wake up with my alarm so every day i am late for work and this makes me stressed right from the beginning once at work i cant concentrate and i get behind and feel like im letting everyone down i am not keeping up on housework or personal hygieneorganisation so i barely have any clean clothes there are no clean plates or crockery there is no food in the house and everything is dirty my new housemate moved in over a month ago and i have still not sorted out a contract so she is not paying me and i am paying for both of us  im finding it very difficult to eat which i think is making me feel a lot worse because i am probably not getting enough nutrition i am also finding it difficult to motivate myself to wash and put clothes on on the days when i am working from home  i have tried to do some fun things to help but i went out to the cinema on sunday with a friend and was on the verge of panic the entire time i was there feeling an inch from passing out i managed to calm myself enough to sit there and watch the film but i was so exhausted by the time the film was over i needed to cancel our plans for dinner and a catchup so i could just go home and get to bed  i am no longer enjoying anything i feel like im being crushed from the outside all of the time  i keep trying to get myself to just take a deep breath and start cracking on with some of these things just chip away at some of the chores so that i can reduce the relentless sense of pressure and of inadequacy  how can i fail so miserably on all aspects of life  but just trying to push myself seems to be doing nothing i find myself escaping into daydreams and just lying there ignoring the world which makes everything so so so much worse because i need to just get everything sorted out so that i dont have to go through this anymore  my housemate is a nightmare i need to speak to her and put some stuff in action but i cant seem to face anything i feel like im going to black out whenever i think about doing anything about anything in fact like im so overwhelmed i cant even make a start  i have some money fortunately so i am going to hire a cleaner this week for a deep clean to just get our flat back into good shape so that i can focus on maintaining it rather than trying to deal with all this mess and dirt all at once that should help once that is done i can safely allow the landlord to come round to sign a new contract then thats done these things should be relatively easy to sortshould  since i left therapy just over two years ago i have had three breakdowns during which everything fell apart and i have not been able to work or really do anything i feel like i am not making improvements despite all of my efforts because here we are again  im at the end of my tether with myself i dont know what to do i wish i could just press some kind of restart button im so stressed out gahokits like its all just hit me at once in the last ten minutes i am working from home this morning but need to be in the office this afternoon like i have to be   last year i collapsed twice in public due to exhaustion and i feel very unwell like that might happen again this is stressing me out because im so embarrassed to phone my new boss and say you know that urgent thing at the office weve been waiting for for months yeah well i dont feel well and yeah i know i was off sick last week also i have to be up super early tomorrow for a 9am meeting in a different city my job is demanding and i am so behind and i just wish i could sleep im so incredibly exhausted sorry for all these posts im really feeling on the verge i just feel like im going to collapse this is awful thanks yes i have a therapist but im not entirely sure theyre right for me i dont really talk to my boss about this stuff i dont really want to do so at the moment maybe if things get really bad i dont know i havent been there long a month   when it comes to how can i take better care of myself its definitely to do with not avoiding things and keeping a routine if i could get to that point  only been trying for a decade or more  then that would help me enormously but i dont really understand why i wont just do it i dont notice myself avoiding at all because i disappear into daydreams and then the time is just gone i dont really mind uncertain situations to be honest its more responsibility that stresses me out i think i probably feel overresponsible sometimes and thats why at the moment one thing that stresses me out for instance is that i have just applied for a sixweek contract doing something that would strengthen my career in my dream job if i got that job i would have to ask my current new employer if i could drop to parttime hours within those six weeks 2 days rather than 5 because the contract is a 3day one i would also have to move to london for those six weeks and the pay isnt great the thing that bothers me most about that is that i feel like my boss will be upset because i feel like she needs me and i would be letting her down thats what i mean by overresponsibility i guess thats what ends up stressing me i feel like everything will fall apart if im not there to hold it up which i think is unrealistic i wouldnt mind too much if she preferred to just find someone else and drop me i think i would still be in probation period anyway because im sure id find another job its more the idea that she depends on me but im sure she doesnt im sure she would not get too stressed and she would be able to find a replacement this feeling that other people need me is basically a big stressor    other people would just be excited about their dream job i agree that exercise works wonders i cycle 10 miles a day to and from work and the days i am working from home and dont get to cycle i feel much worse so update i am basically managing to make it through and i think i have stemmed the worst of it the flat is clean now which is a bonus the flatmate problem may have just disappeared because shes currently away and has decided she might not return she has been offered substance abuse help so that may have solved itself she is also now aware of how much her drinking impacts on me  i went out on saturday for a meal with a friend but quickly went south and started to feel like i was going to throw up so we went back to watch some telly away from noise and stimulation and he made up a spare bed for me so that i could be somewhere vaguely more relaxing with some company which was nice i slept sitting up because sometimes i get bad acid reflux and if i throw up while thats happening its not very nice at all but i still got a good rest then i basically spent yesterday lying on his couch being fed and watching comedy and having little naps that definitely turned back the clock a bit on the exhaustion today i am feeling bad again however my plan for finding the fun in life seemed good but i dont seem to be in the physical state to do so at the moment it occurred to me eventually that what seems to drive everything is an underlying sense of inadequacy that has no real rhyme or reason ie i cant think of anything i dont like about myself its more that i feel that i am never quite enough or never quite achieving enough i think the sense of never feeling safe  and therefore constantly on edge and tense  is coming from the underlying shame something i have been trying to find a way around for the last couple of years now im not quite sure what can be done about shame overall  particularly if you are very aware there is no reason to feel ashamed my fake it until you make it idea has been something of a flop so perhaps as much mindfulness as possible will help  really rather sick of all this sick of feeling exhausted and unwell all of the bloody time especially when i can tell its all so absurd if i cant think of one thing i dont like about myself not that i dont have flaws its just i dont mind having flaws because everyone does then why all this felt inadequacyshame i sort of know the reason i know it is that my standards are very high etc and i know the historical reason for where that has come from parenting etc but none of that actually seems to make a practical difference to my life i have understanding and awareness  i dont seem to have the majority of the communication problems they say come from shame although i do not tend to mix so remain alone probably too often  so its frustrating its frustrating to read articles on shame that tell you to try not to blame others etc and i think yeah i dont do you know what i mean or they say something like accept yourself and im like i do its like the whole problem is something so vague that you cant practically approach it  eurgh sorry this is just a rant i think im just quite frustrated now that i feel i really put the effort in with mental health and i always try to be proactive and positive about it and do everything i can to have a normal life but sometimes it feels like bashing your head against a brick wall thanks sorry ive been really unclear i dont have a problem being out and about or anything i went out last night for example and was fine its more if my body is already tenseworn out from exhaustion then the usual things vomiting acid nausea muscle weakness feeling faint etc affect me and get worse if im in somewhere that is highly stimulating since my level of stimulation is already high  ive learned over the years that its best for me to listen to that feeling and go to bedget some rest in the past i have thought just anxiety then passed out in dangerous places  over the years just tried to tell the difference between panic attack that will go away in 10 minutes which means stay put and exhaustion that needs actual attention which means go lie down i admit i still find it difficult to tell sometimes but generally i give it an hour or two and see what happens if it doesnt go awaygets worse within that time i opt for exhaustion need a rest if it goes awayi feel better i opt for panic stay put  its a balancing act i suppose but ive learned to listen to what my body tells me its a good thing i went to bed and got some rest as it made me feel a lot better  like i say i think perhaps the problem is me putting this issue under anxiety when perhaps thats not what i mean exactly i think my major issue could be simplified as such  nagging feelings of insignificance that i look away fromignore cause an underlying sense of pressure over the course of weeksmonths and this higher tension prevents me from resting properly through a process of sleep deprivation overwork and an inability to express emotion i cant cry or express anger generally so i end up ignoring my emotions dont know what to do with them and pushing them down i become increasingly exhausted as a result of which i get behind on everything like house work for example and this increases my feeling inadequacy because im not keeping up and feel like a failure eventually my body just kind of falls apart i normally pass out or start throwing up a lot then i take a couple of weeks to rest everything goes back to normal then repeat  so i guess its still anxiety but its less like nerves if that makes sense and more like a feeling of being under tons of pressure i understand the need for most people with anxiety to stay in situations that make them uncomfortable etc but i actually have to go the other way a bit i tend to ignore the feelings i get thinking just anxiety ignore it but i miss the fact that sometimes it actually needs attention for instance youre exhausted and need to sleep which leads to the passing out etc because im confusing a physical need with an emotional oneif that makes senseso im trying to notice the early warning signs of exhaustion and take action go home rest stop working before i end up ill and having to take a lot of time out  otherwise im trying to find a place in my head that feels right to me empty positive statements make everything worse that will help me to feel less like i just dont matter its not the case that i feel i dont matter to friendsfamily i do matter to them of course its more a feeling that i dont have any intrinsic worth which is why im constantly trying to achieve very highly because i get a moment of relief from the low self worth if i do something extremely well of course most people  me included  cannot do things extremely well most of the time we have our moments so i am constantly chasing a rare moment and making it harder for myself to reach it by getting to frantic to get there which reduces your creativity being the cleversuccessful one at some point became like the cornerstone of my entire identity so my sense of self just kind of imploded when i left education and was no longer the star that was years ago now and ive not managed to find that place in my head where i can still be a worthwhile person and not the highest achiever i tend to dismiss all of my successes posteducation because none of them seem quite successful enough so i cant find worth in them anymore anyway im rambling guess im just trying to explain whats going on i want to be able to find worth intrinsically instead of having to achieve very highly but im still in the process of working that out trying to just tell myself that logically i matter anyway etc or trying to rationalise with myself leaves me empty ok just going to keep adding to this thread thank you everybody for all the support so far   ive taken a day off work today  first sick day in this job  because i woke up pain all over muscle pain and felt totally shattered boss was fine with it didnt lie told her i was just exhausted and that i needed a day of rest had a friend round for a couple of tea but only managed a couple of hours before i started to feel very unwell too much stimulation so had to say our goodbyes and then i sat and did nothing for a while until the nauseadizziness calmed down   im a bit at the end of my tether with this i have done everything right this weekend i felt well on saturday so i used that day to get some shopping in and i did a bit of my arts projects which made me feel good about myself i put on candles and incense was all relaxed happy hopeful etcyesterday went out with friends to the cinema felt absolutely awful from the time i got there but clocked it was probably anxiety so ignored it didnt really calm down although i just got on with things i had that weird feeling looking back where your memory is all blurry and you realise you just werent with it the whole time didnt sleep quite as well as usual but not particularly sleep deprived eitherdid tons of mindfulness over the weekend including full meditations three times over weekend kept aware and mindful as possible taking deep breaths and doing relaxation exercises at intervals throughout the day etcwake up and bam dead feeling sick when i move going faint very quickly if i do too much at once like standing up for more than five minutes and having to put my head down until the ringing in my ears stops etc pain all over my body this is nervous exhaustion ive been here before about four or five times a year for the last 10 years  so sick of this i feel like what im doing at the moment isnt helping i want to change tack do something that i really believe will help because im feeling powerless against this i dont have a clue what to do though do i go back to a gp last time they said they couldnt help i tried crisis point last time i had severe exhaustion and they couldnt help i tried all the charities they cant help all they keep saying is that i already know everything they can teach meso is there any worth in going back is there something else i can try am i just doing this wrong in some way  i just dont know what to do i want to have a life thanks stray im feeling a bit better now than i was an hour ago it seems to come in waves   my bloods and bp and etc have been tested a couple of times a year for the last decade and theres never been anything wrong so i doubt there will be now as the symptoms havent changed at all i think theyve probably tested me for everything under the sun by now ive had my heart checked ive been to a neurologist a gastroenterologist urologists for when i was having bladder issues too fortunately resolved now quite spontaneously all any of them ever found was inflammation which they put down to tension or lowlevel infections that my stressed out immune system couldnt handle basically even the physical stuff thats actually been wrong with me has all turned out to be caused by stress   i think i will go back to the gp and just ask one more time i think i will change the gp im registered at this week to try a new practice sometimes fresh eyes on a case might help my friends doctor is very good with mental health problems so i think i might switch to her and see if she has any more insight thanks for the support again all i feel like im just using this as my rant thread  im sort of back to work today in that i was too exhausted to go to work so started working from home i wish id called in now because im not really getting anything done and im so tired i keep feeling angry and trapped i dont have anything in for lunch but i dont have the energy to go to the shop and buy something my flatmate did all the washing up last night in the early hours of the morning and i felt a bit angry about thatpartly because stop making noise in the early hours of the morningand partly because i knew she was doing my washing up where i hadnt had the energy to do it and i already feel terrible about how im not keeping up its not fair to be angry at her for doing it if its understandably bothering her but its more because i can feel this constant pressure its not coming from her its coming from me but when she does the housework its like i feel that pressure that i should be doing that or i should have done that by now and then the exhaustion just gets worse then theres the pressure to be at work  i spoke with my mam yesterday about trying to decide what to do and she thought i should go on esa but i dont think i would get it people with serious mental illness dont always get it and technically i can work its just that i burn out quickly so i dont think id have a chance on top of that theres all that stress of the assessments and i would maybe be on the cut version of esa by the time my claim went through so then how would i cope i wouldnt be able to live on barely any money its not going to be relaxing is it  sorry just ranting its just a vent i feel so angry all of a sudden i just want to have a rest and i feel like its not an option i have a friend whose parents have money and when she gets stressed in her job she just quits then she has a rest for months while she looks for jobs but doesnt claim benefits because then she would forced into work she would find stressful so she turns down jobs until she finds one that will suit her i just wish my life was like that i know that sounds really petty but whenever she tells me that shes quit her job and that it was the right thing to do and yada yada i totally agree with her because her welfare is important but i also feel bitter because i think bully for you wouldnt it be nice if life were like that for the rest of us isnt that horrible  anywayrantingactually genuinely made me feel slightly better to rant though ok i have made my decision today i dont feel stressed now just completely hollowed out and weak all over i feel like i cant physically do things now im fairly sure its my body reacting to how much i dont want to do anything rather than a physical problem but there you go   i havent done any work today my mind just wont take information in at all its like my brain is just really tired and wont function   i have decided i want proper time off  like 3 months  regardless of which way i have to go to do that im in probation so i will probably have to give up the job but thats not an issue i will get another job i always do   ive never really gone this far to help myself before and over the last 10 years i have repeatedly taken off some time but gone back before i felt well thats not working my whole body is crying out to just rest and not have any responsibility for a little while until im strong enough to go back to it im going to listen to it now im going to have proper time off do nothing for the first week or so  however long it takes me to naturally want to start again and that does happen with me i guess i have a driven personality so i never want to lie down and do nothing for too long the motivation naturally comes back  and then i want to pace up to a normal amount of activity slowly instead of rushing back to full activity i truly believe this will work because im listening to my guts and thats what my guts are telling me will work its exactly the kind of thing i would never have let myself do before so i think thats what i should do   i can see this will be stressful when it comes to benefitsemploymentforms etc but i might just enlist a couple of friends to give me a hand when those forms come in or when there are those things to do and see if they dont mind just sitting with me to get through it in exchange for a chat and a tea sorry to keep updating here i think it is somewhat helping me to keep sane i sent off the email this morning that said i would need three months off i ignored a phone call from boss because i couldnt face it but listened to voicemail later she sounded emotional and said she was shocked etc i cant remember if i said how sorry i was in the email because i was really confused when writing it im going to call her tomorrow to say how sorry i am and how i know it is bad timing and how hard i tried to keep it together  my friend took me to register at the doctors so at least that is done now i am quite mad unfortunately i guess it is stress but i feel kind of manic in a way full of big ideas for new social enterprises etci was sending really long texts to my friend about what we would do to create our own business and then realised that actually i have gone insane  i feel really weird and extremely alert i havent eaten a proper meal for a bit my friend made me a chicken dinner and ive tried picking at it but im not doing too well i just feel like i might actually be losing my mind but im sure it is the stress i feel incredibly unreal  i dont think sitting here alone is helping but i have called my friends already and im not calling them again im usually fine alone i spend a lot of time alone but i feel absolutely bizarre more ranting yay    my body hurts i feel completely wasted of energy and unable to cope im in bed and im staying here i havent phoned my boss because i dont feel up to it but i think i will text her and say what i would have said  or perhaps i will phone  i dont know i need to say something   i feel like my mind and body are falling apart i spoke to my counsellor for an hour on the phone and we went through how trapped i feel and how that feeling of being so trapped causes this perpetual exhaustion i feel that it is me against the world  not in terms of anyone being maliciously out to harm me  but more a feeling of its me on my own for myself and that i need to work hard to create my own life or i will be oppressed it sounds kind of adolescent i guess but since i was like 10  i remember the dreams i had clearly then actually  i made this decision that i would work hard and create my own life my own success that was how i was going to escape i was going to be a person with the power to make decisions about my own life i didnt expect success and freedom to land in my lap i expected that i would work for it and earn my way but i guess it kind of hasnt worked out yet and i still feel trapped in the life other people want rather than the one i want for myself i have spent my 20s trying to escape by putting all of my energy into trying to cope with my mh problems while creating my own life to escape to through working on my creative projects outside of paid work but i can never leave that is the feeling i am being held back both by the limitations of my body and mind and by the barriers that exist in real life i talked about how angry and bitter i was when i left university and saw people with money choose to work for free for the big broadcasters so they had experience and could later get paid work it felt so unfair that these lazy arses just have their lives handed to them on plates while people like me dont have the time or money to buy those opportunities and have to work double hard for less chance of getting anywhere i know thats more black and white than the world really is  these jobs arent closed off to those who are less privileged people work their way up all the time  its just that its so much easier if mummy and daddy pay it just gives people that legup in life anyway i am genuinely less bitter now its just one of those things  another thing  that makes me feel trapped    i had a friend here yesterday who described us as being in the same boat and i kind of wanted to tell her to fuck off shes never been financially independent and although she quit her job for being too stressful she is not on benefits because her family and fiance will just support her no ones on her back telling her to man the fuck up about it either i understand what she means about being in the same boat because there are similarities but hearing that our lives are just the same felt so rich coming from the person whose parents have now paid for two masters degrees when i cant even afford to do one shes now talking about retraining in something else i understand because i do better in education too than in work i really fit into the world of academia it suits my personality down to the ground but i cant have that because i cant afford it anyway shut up notrealname stop whining to be clear i dont want her to be dragged down into my misery i want her to take the opportunities she has been afforded in life it would be ridiculous not to i guess i just wish i had the same opportunities   all in all i think at the bottom of everything i just want someone to give a shit about how i feel rather than how well i am currently performing the ridiculous thing is that i know people do give a shit about how i feel of course they do to suggest otherwise would be completely unfair of course my friends and family care about me but for some reason i sort of cant feel it inside   eurgh hopefully i will start to feel less dead soon hi everyone adding to this mega thread once more thank you everybody for all the support here its really appreciated  ive been off work for about 4 weeks i feel a lot less exhausted than i did the first two weeks i couldnt eat or sleep properly so i really wasnt able to do anything then last week things slowly started to look up and now im feeling more physically stable i can eat i need to remind myself a bit but i can do it and i have slept however the feeling of having died is still there  i suppose im feeling a bit afloat i know i should be getting back to work and i know i should do something to help myself i have made some small attempts at helping myself along the way but the overwhelming feeling of pointlessness keeps hitting me and i give up and avoid the world instead i rarely get dressed or wash or speak to people i just spend all day on the internet and try not to think about my life  i dont really know what im trying to say here im just feeling a bit hopeless ive always been so proactive with my mental health i always get back on the horse but i just feel like i cant do it again ive been living like this for 17 years now if it was episodic then at least i would know this will pass but its not episodic its chronic and its just wearing me down i feel like i have followed all of the advice and i managed to keep up hope for so long but ive really lost all that light at the end of the tunnel feeling i used to have i no longer trust anything to make a difference to me because ive tried so many things in the past and while small changes have been affected  and as you can see from my signature i have fully recovered from a lot of things  the basic sense of ever receiving pleasure from life is the thing thats just not changing im tired of every day being a struggle of having to pep talk myself through life on this promise that if i keep trying different things or try looking at it a different way or try a new therapy or a new pill things will eventually improve its been so long without improvement now that ive stopped believing it  i did go to a new gp she was good because she spent a while understanding my history and asked a lot of questions like usual she can offer me nothing though its been like that for a couple of years because i have now exhausted services i have had all the therapy i have tried all the pills so all they do is go through the entire list and then shrug their shoulders and tell me to come back in a few weeks i just get the sense that im not the only one who has given up  a couple of years ago i still had the belief that things would change and that in the future i wouldnt have mental health problems anymore and id have a normal life but i give up now its become impossible to imagine that its starting to seem almost irrational to think that could ever happen i hate panic attacks hate them i know we all do but i thought it was worth really highlighting that fact i know theyre harmless and wont do me any damage but jesus wept are they horrible   fortunately over the years ive found enough ways to calm the f down instead of have a panic attack but i have spent the last two hours at work only doing that holding myself back from the brink of an attack ive been largely feeling like i will pass out and nearly managed to convince myself i would faint because i hadnt eaten enoughdespite the big bowl of porridge first thing this morning the cereal bar and banana when i got to work and the salmon curry i had for lunch i didnt manage to unconvince myself that i would faint from low blood sugar until after the custard donut and then i just had to admit it was irrational but then i do cycle 10 miles a day work and backwhat if i have depleted my energy stores without noticing over the week and im about to collapse from exhaustion i know i knowbut this is the shit that goes through my mind i collapsed from exhaustion twice last year so it isnt completely out of the question but im in a different place since then   anyway im just moaning im so sick of this i want to go home and curl up in bed and just quit trying to live like a normal person i have no fucking clue what i am stressed about or why im panicking i was in therapy last night and the therapist commented on how upbeat i seemed i feel fine    i give up booooooo well if that happened to me id feel pretty shitty too to be honest that all seems massively unjust this might sound like a weird question but are you definitely anxious or are you angry the only reason i ask is because often when i am angry i feel anxious instead and i get panic attacks and stuff this is because i cant really process anger i dont really know what to do with it so all that bottled up anger comes out in adrenaline and panic the only reason i ask is because it can be useful to be totally sure about exactly what emotion were dealing with of course it may be that none of this is the case for you and you are actually worried about something  i think the whole thing would make me feel powerless though if i was in your situation do you feel like you have been properly heard is there anything else you can do to be heard i disagree with your therapist by the way running away from this situ would be bullshit unless you can transfer your phd elsewhere and its not too late to rock the boat if the other lecturers didnt want to rock the boat but that means you suffer then screw the other lecturers can you appeal the decision formally thats kind of different from complaining you could say you would like a written explanation as to why you were not able to receive funding and for all justifications to be outlined clearly if it doesnt work then look into other phds in other unis  my suggestion is based on the fact that if you feel so powerless in a situation you are bound to feel like shit doing everything you can to be heard and to show yourself that you are not powerless and you can raise your voice or vote with your feet might help with the way youre feeling its important not to just lie down and take it it is not possible for anyone to lie down and take it and then feel perfectly fine about that if you need to speak to the other staff before you do anything then i think you should explain to them that while you have considered their opinions and understand their reasoning the injustice is affecting you and you simply feel you do not deserve to be treated unequally and need to take a stand for your own good they will respect that trust me ive noticed that viruses seem to hit me a lot harder than they used to when i was at school and at uni if i got a cold i would just continue as normal it was slightly annoying but that was all nowadays if i get a cold i can barely eat i cant think straight i havent got the energy to go to the shop i feel faint a lot of the time all i can do is sit here and stare at a wall or go to sleep note this is not flu as i do not have a fever and in fact do not have that many respiratory symptoms bar a cough and a bit of sneezing this happens several times a year and its very annoying i do have a virus of some sort  evidenced by the coughing etc  but the degree to which it affects my functioning seems absurd ten years ago it would take real flu high fever hallucinations etc or norovirus to put me out of action otherwise i could continue as normal but now it takes hardly anything   at first i assumed this was age im only 29 but i have noticed it has got worse as i get older but then i spoke to others my age and older about it and they said they havent noticed anything similar and that they thought it was probably my coping mechanisms that have changed perhaps i was just better able to cope when i was young than i am now which was interesting i wondered if it has something to do with anxiety  has anyone else here noticed that they are much more easily disabled by very minor ailments anxiety makes us more suggestible i tend to feel others pain when i see someone stub their toe for instance i feel something should up my nerve it just means im a bit suggestible to my own imagination  which i totally am i think its what they call being easily hypnotisable  happens to people who get very involved in their daydreamsfantasy prone personality as some people call it  but when anxious that trait escalates so youre basically just feeling what is in your imagination which itself is being suggested by the images on tv best to work on reducing the anxiety thanks i have been to a doctor about it several times over the years but always described it to them as anxiety some plucky doctors have asked further questions such as what are you worried about and when i tell them im not worried and dont feel emotional and go into my symptoms with them they have always disagreed its something psychological and done a battery of tests which always come back negative so i always feel like ive proven my point that its psychological my anxiety has always shown itself in my body rather than my emotions so i get a lot of psychosomatic problems but emotionally i feel pretty level most of the time with brief interruptions of selfloathing if i feel ive made a mistake or failed at something  its actually pretty much gone away today so i wont go to the doctor right now but when i come to register with a new doctor ill bring it up and ask if it is possible to have something underlying that could be triggered by stress simply because i havent heard of anyone else describing my symptoms from anxiety alone but then my anxiety sometimes seems different from other peoples so perhaps its just the way i feel it i may as well explain it to them properly its obviously nothing serious if its happened so many times now but if theres anything that can make my quality of life better id go for it  thanks for the advice x oki have a bad habit of putting way too many things down to stress and failing to recognise when theres something physical going on  so basically this has happened a lot over the years and twice this year i get ill but not ill worried or panicky i mean i get physically drained when i physically or mentally exert myself  even just walking to the shop  i feel like all the energy has been drained from my body and im going to die  haha  well collapse or fall unconscious i guess i also get very nauseous and mentally confused when like this its just severe exhaustion i guess it takes a looooong time to go away and in the meantime im completely indisposed because i just cant get through the day i end up sleeping up to 15 hours at a time and only feel slightly better when i wake up  my pulse is slightly elevated but not all the time  i can tell by listening to it im not the type to actually measure my pulse im not generally worried though i do feel depressed and the things that have worried me have been a the fact that being ill means letting others down and b that i might not be able to take care of all my responsibilities if im too ill and c im embarrassed about being ill for so long and think others will judge me so all of my concerns are about the illness itself its not like im worried about something and thats whats caused this my friend pointed out that whenever i say ah you know what im actually feeling loads better its when ive been sitting still for a while and that whenever i say oh my god its come back i feel awful its when ive stood up or started walking this seems to be consistent its when i physically move  this has happened a lot through the years and it always goes away eventually so not too worried about it but i suddenly wonder whether maybe there is something else going on  perhaps its possible to have an underlying anaemia that is made worse by too much mentalphysical exertion i guess i wanted to see if others get this which would convince me its normal for anxiety i should push myself to see a doctor but im too tired and weak to physically get to a gp ive never been sure where to place my anxiety as a disorder because it seems a little different from other peoples anxiety and similar at the same time   my anxiety is specifically routed in perfectionism i feel overwhelmed by the constant need to be perfect and to do well i am not an avoider  which i hear is mostly an anxiety thing avoider that which you fear  i am an overachiever im trying to overcompensate so i have no need to fear   every six months or so i burnout i work constantly cant engage properly in social things i find people irritating a lot of the time because i consider them to be difficult in various way and therefore work becomes the most important thing then i work too hard think others will judge me if i make mistakes so work even harder then burnout so completely that i end up ill i mean physically ill totally exhausted and unable to function at all which is where i am now in bed missing work ready to receive a written warning for doing so  which of course feels doubly upsetting after all the hard work ive put in   i want to stop i so want to stop and i cant im aware of the problem i keep trying to notice the problem and react a different way and not burn myself into the ground but im not getting it right i keep doing this to myself   i just want to have a normal life and this is ridiculous   sorry this is a rant not a question isnt it as you were oh me too when i first read about attachment theory i assumed i was avoidant because the list of things avoidant people relate to sounded exactly like me independence is extremely important needing others is weak etc etc but these are actually also the things ambivalent people think  perhaps more so                all part of his view that hes not good to be with           i am not in any way criticising him but the truth is that right now at this moment hes right about that you can have compassion for him and understand his depression and his inability  right now  to be able to provide for others im not asking you to be angry or to hate him for that im sure youd find that impossible because its absolutely not his fault but unfortunately it does mean that right now he is not able to provide you with what you need to be happy and what you need to be happy is not too much as he has attested himself in your heart wish him the best and hope he finds happiness in the future but also recognise that you do deserve someone who is capable of meeting your needs and capable of providing a fulfilling relationship                if he wasnt going away travelling in a couple of weeks time i would broach this more with him and perhaps see if he wanted to try things again after a little while but i now have to sit on my hands and think carefully about what i want to say to him to be honest i would love to get back together with him but the timing is just all wrong and that is all part of why i panic i think i know hes going away and knowing this i want to be with him all the time the obsession is horrible and i wind up wasting all my energy on thinking about us and him rather than me           understandable but keep moving those thoughts back to yourself every time you find yourself thinking of him whats really going to make you feel better   there are a couple of trends among ambivalent folks like you and i firstly a sense of powerlessness  a sense of feeling trapped stuck controlled helpless as if no matter what you will not get what you want from life accept this is not true sit down with yourself and work out what you want from life and then make it your pact with yourself that you are going to go out there and do that right now what do you want for your career what do you want from your hobbies how do you envisage yourself loving life separate to your boyfriend and youre just going to have to trust that this is possible work out what it is  and dream big  and then go out there and do that thing if it seems overwhelming work out what steps you can take to approach it in small chunks and no matter how you feel force yourself forward into it when you recognise yourself having thoughts or feelings that are upsetting do not judge yourself for them you have not failed just be aware they are there and tell yourself oh im thinking about that again and gently shift your attention if its an emotion say to yourself im feeling  but emotions wane if i let them and dont fight them and i can cope with this i will feel ok again soon allow your thoughts allow your feelings do not ever judge yourself for them and gently shift your attention to something fulfilling or enjoyable because you deserve that  the other trend among ambivalent folk is to believe they are incompatible with most people  they tend to at some deep level believe love is rare and they also tend to have a hard time believing they can be happy with anyone but this one person  there are two reasons for this firstly love was actually rare for you when you were growing up it is totally rational for your brain to have learned that this is true fortunately its not there are millions of people out there for you its difficult to believe that right now but accept it is true and keep reminding yourself of that fact also accept it is difficult for you to believe  and this is 100 normal for absolutely everybody out there in your situation but recognise that in three months time you will not believe he is the only man out there anymore  the second reason you are stuck on him is because the only way you can rid yourself of shame is to be accepted despite what you believe are shameful flaws neediness etc another person accepting you in your head would not wipe away that shame only him accepting you would wipe away that shame recognise this thought pattern and remind yourself that none of this is your fault and that he does accept you just as you are he just also realises that he cannot be in a relationship right now and he needs to focus on himself you need to focus on yourself too  be very very kind to yourself its difficult if youre in the habit of selfshaming so dont beat yourself up if you find it hard just recognise when youre doing it and gently shift your attention and keep repeating to yourself that you have nothing to be ashamed of not quite a similar thing although a friend once sent me an email telling me to contact her when i get better after i leaned on her too heavily she was wrong to do that in that thats not the way to respond to someone ever but she had a point in that she wasnt able to enjoy the friendship when i was so constantly in need and i needed to find better ways to help myself  it sounds like your brother has not sent the most compassionate letter and he is being a little controlling here and treating you like a child which is certainly not helpful allowing yourself to feel shame over this will make everything a lot worse so do not do that have compassion for yourself you did not intend harm you were desperate for support  but youre right that the way you are seeking support may not be the most effective and the most reliable and may put strain on relationships are you currently in therapy with chronic anxiety this severe you could maybe try psychotherapy  make sure your gp understands the severity so heshe knows what to do  sometimes as children we have not learned self soothing techniques which makes it very difficult to self soothe as an adult i have found the best way is mindfulness  which means observing your thoughts and emotions rather than attaching to them start with simple emotions and work up to more complex ones  so for instance if im exhausted and havent slept well and im in work instead of getting worked up that im tired and i cant concentrate and letting that frustrate me i just say to myself im tired but thats ok i dont have to perform all the time ill just take it slowly and see what i can get done ill get home soon   or if im in a meeting and the team are really frustrating instead of attaching to my anger i notice it and think im feeling angry at the moment it sounds very simple but it actually calms you the fuck right down it gives you a little distance between yourself and your emotions  i found it really good for dealing with anxiety when anxiety started i just thought im feeling anxious it wont do me any harm and when dealing with rumination and anxious thoughts i find it helpful to catch myself doing it and say to myself im having those thoughts again but theyre just thoughts and they dont help me to feel content and then i focus my attention on my surroundings and on what is actually happening in the moment this distancing stops the flow of the thoughts and helps them to ebb away sometimes you have to do it a few times to get a result but if you keep doing it and doing it youll start feeling better\n",

      "doc: just come back from the shop sick sick sick of feeling so ill i feel others in the shop think im really weird but what can i do i know i wouldnt be there if i didnt have the problems i have so what can anyone expect me to do im trying my best its so hard for others to understand the level of anxiety i have thats not a criticism at all just i had to go on the shop floor even though i wasnt comfortable and just felt i was dying with panic the other lady there was very nice but its pretty hard to understand my desperation had to keep escaping too many people around too close and i didnt want to be asked anything everything around me feels like a dream i just feel wrong so wrong bus back was manic attention was drawn to me for a second when the driver didnt stop long enough for me to get off i went back to my seat and didnt say anything it wasnt my fault he didnt stop obviously but im convinced i did something really really odd when people looked just horrible alone now feeling so fearful and stuck i know this all sounds petty but when i feel as ill as this everything that happens feels so intense i really dont think im well enough for that meal tomorrow now listening to euros childs ends that i received in the post and will make a cup of tea and a meal if i can get myself to move today was hard mainly cause of the anxiety but not as intense and i made a lot of progress by going to that christmas meal and i basically held it together everyones lovely   though i recently spoke to someone who told me theyd probably be alone for christmas and i wish i could have said or done more to help i feel guilty that i know this and didnt have an answer just saying that i really hope they can get something sorted out isnt good enough is it for all the friends ive lost contact with through fear of fear suffering the physical effects of my fear and isolation im so sorry i have to keep hoping that i can get well enough to bring people i love back into my life again and for it to be worth it for them this time all the things ive avoided and left not pursued all the many minutes wasted pacing by the door or waiting for a neighbour to go back inside before going out and living any of my own life the huge list of things ive not comfortable with and having to do things the hardest way possible to avoid the horrible discomfort all the opportunities ive had and felt paralysed to take up  ive been reallly improving in some ways m reminded me of this this morning but i still feel completely mad the thoughts that go through my head and the things i feel trying to do everyday stuff i forget what its like to feel geniune enthusiasm for much all i ever seem to think about is seeming ok to others and getting through things i keep trying to be around more people and when i do i get so scared and paralysed i feel close to passing out my mind and body feel disconnected somehow something feels really off what kind of a life is it where other human beings many of them lovely people all feel like scary obstacles i have to avoid i cant even look at someone without my head jolting away as i try to make eye contact squeezing and fiddling with my hands and not even realising until later id hurt them from the tension and that feeling like my insides are floating towards the ceiling leaving my body just going to a record shop with m yesterday provoked a panic attack where i then had a nose bleed for 30 minutes from straining the blood vessels i shouldnt be at the till too scared to speak not being able to look up hands dripping with sweat feeling rooted to the spot i didnt do any of the things i could have done on new years eve  a phone ringing shouldnt sound like an alarm calling my execution nor should the doorbell all these shoulds and shouldnt yet this is how it is  but anyway ive had some better times in the past week or so christmas wasnt too bad in the end i had some nice moments with my family which meant a lot the shop i volunteer in thanked me for my help so far and gave me a giftcard its nice to feel like im helping in some way still making stuff and enjoying my course even when other people think its a waste of time because i know its not keep on keeping on etc  i think theres probably a lot more research that needs to be done into social fears and problems i really think theres a lot more that needs to be understood often anxiety disorders are said to be linked to genetic causes and ive read in several places that mercury can possibly cause social anxiety though i havent found much information to solidly support it   on a completely unrelated note m  i spent about an hour yesterday drunkenly laughing at the phrase dont look a gift horse in the mouth imagining a horse wrapped up in a massive bow spewing acid if you get too close but now its obvious where the phrase would have come from duh ive lived in my current flat for 2 and a half years where ive had and continue to have a lot of problems and its contributed to my poor mental health ive had people all around me trying to encourage me to get out but the process of moving feels absolutely terrifying to me and i dont think my minds up to it  its also been made harder by my situation on housing benefit due to being too sick to work which obviously makes moving out privately incredibly hard and social housing isnt really an option ive been on a gateway to home choice scheme but there hasnt been much available and the way the scheme works seems odd to me ive not had any luck  i have a social phobia which makes just meeting an estate agent for the viewing far far more scary and important to me that it would ideally be and all these worries about interactions and my fear of panicking and not thinking anything through properly at the viewing is strong and justified due to previous events i have a massive fear of saying something stupid and getting the practical stuff wrong instead of concentrating on the fact that im trying to improve my situation which is very counterproductive and skews my priorities im also plagued with the belief that i dont deserve to move  despite all this i rung up a letting agency after months and months of procrastinating and arranged a viewing for a property on wednesday  my partner will be working at the time of the viewing so cant come with me and my support worker is unavailable too i have to organize someone to come with me in time as my body and mind sort of shuts down ive made a checklist of things to observe when i go to the viewing but my head is swimming with upcoming interactions and the massive tangle of other tasks i have to do regarding moving  im also scared about how im going to be with neighbours i want to be able to come across approachable and be neighbourly but my anxiety has such a hold over me  ive just got thoughts going round and round and round if someone had anything that would reassure me andor any tips i would greatly appreciate it so often when i feel like this i want a way to just run away from all these rules and processes and etiquettes and expectations and just hide  i should be able to get some help from my partnersupport workermaybe a friend but i just feel so inadequate and unable to do all this practical stuffim not a very practical person  i have sent off an application form for volunteering at a chairty shop but even they are full up for volunteers due to the current climate so itll be a while before i even have the possiblility of volunteering there thanks hope for taking the time to respond in this way  im sort of glad that i didnt get to view it in a sense  yes im the same i cannot retain any information in situations like that say the things i want to and be assertive if necessary i have so called delusions about the way i appear to others and every single millisecond of interaction i feel like i am doing something intangibly terrible in the way i look to others i lose a lot of ability to move in my neck facial muscles and upper body feel very paranoid and detached and get a lot of bizarre racing thoughts it feels as if theres a force field around other people and i get more uncomfortable the closer in distance they get the only proper relationship i have now is the one with my partner who i am almost normal with i step out the door and its like my true self is being smothered by something my muscles have been clamped in place i have a lot of repressed anger and i often get into agonising confused  distraught states of mind that nothing can touch anyway sorry i go on for ages about this sort of stuff  my partner says he cant set up viewings  make phone calls for me etc as they always end up needing to speak to me regardless and they wonder why i havent phoned them myself he has put up with a lot with me he has his own things to deal with and i guess its not fair for me to expect it of him he isnt living with me because hes involved with a livein project wont elaborate for privacy reasons and im not able to be part of it as this point its a weird situation for two people together to be in but thats just how it is at the moment i dont want to try and stop him doing something hes so passionate about  i know its important to exercise making phone calls myself but in situations like this where i have to make several phone calls in quick succession and be constantly in contact i am just emotionally unable to itll probably have taken me an hour to make the last one and then i can not get my head around doing it again afterwards  i definitely have to bring written stuff to viewings  i always have it does help a bit i agree  this flat i found online it was through an agency though not one id heard of though when i moved in i only dealt directly with the landlord i dont know i cant really think about it properly right now  i have been looking for places through a bigger local agency in this instance  todays been awful more flat  family related stuff since my  last post i really feel as if ive cracked today my mind is a complete mess i hate myself and the misunderstandings from people around me trapped in the living hell in my mind the world feels fing horrible ive been careless  been walking about aimlessly instead of walking home unable to stop myself crying in public geniunely feel like jumping off a bridge but could never bring myself to hi thank you again sorry for being like that yesterday i havent left the house today and have been very low and teary i know it only makes it worse but sometimes my heads in a bind and i just cant muster the energy to get back on my feet or know what i can really do im feeling better right now though than i did earlier today  yesterday  i am under the care of a cmht luckily  do have a support worker though they are all currently off work due to holiday or sickness apart from my therapist who i have two more sessions with now the next one in a couple of weeks time ive had help being accompanied to groups help with benefit entitlements grocery shopping generally getting out etc theyve been very good  i am very appreciative of it  hope youre ok x hi thanks katie   yesterday was generally a very positive day though ending quite badly i saw friends i hadnt seen in ages and helped out with a project for a few hours with them planting large quantities of stuff i cant believe i did it and did mentally congratulate myself for it being in a social environment is massively tiring for me just the constant detachment from those around me feeling alien being terrified that im coming across in a weird way feeling restricted in movements and worried about body language feeling like im doing something incorrectly and thats on the very good days like yesterday when i can actually do something like that it was really nice to see them though and although i often feel that everyone thinks im the weirdest and most person they know it wasnt too bad  there was stuff that happened after i got back home later in the evening but it was sort of manageable  today has been horrible though its such a contrast and im always trying to work out what the causes are for it what is the ratio of events to existing mood physical and mental state there was something i found out that id done a while ago that i cant even bear to mention not bad as in a criminal sense or lacking morality but something that i was amazed that had come from myself odd and sad seemed like something done by someone else and made me seriously question the reality of who i think i am as a person now it screamed terrifying lack of insight and made me realise just how much better i am now than i was then id somehow forgotten id even done this and it thrusted me into this intolerable humiliation confusion of identity and suicidal thoughts i couldnt have done this thing i refuse to admit i ever did it i dont know what to do now ive done this ive been out all day and havent been able to run home and hide in bed away from everyone which is what ive felt like doing it also made me think how the hell can my partner love me when im so negatively weird  i know i was incredibly tired after yesterday but antsy and feverish  wasnt able to sleep properly last night as usual during to pregabalin side effects that have stuck with me to a lesser degree but still very distressing after being off the drug for months so that must have had some effect on how ive reacted to things today i have felt more vulnerable and off since getting up this morning in comparison to yesterday  the whole thing with having these mood fluctuations i feel unable to control or even pinpoint is so frustrating how i have rare days of feeling almost well then how it disappears like a mirage  how you can feel much better one day achieve a lot and be congratulated for it by other people telling me that my work on getting better is paying off  of course im grateful theyre pleased for me and i dont know what id expect them to say though its the fact that other people often completely connect that achievement to me pulling my socks up although i have put effort in with stuff and i know how important this is to recovery there is definitely a lot largely out of my control and i think almost everyone else here would identify with this on a personal level  i dont think much of what ive just said made any sense its just a stream of consciousness that i needed to get out the housing stuff is still moving forward but i dont feel valid or deserving or normal enough to be part of any of it well ill continue this regardless more slow progress re new flat stuff moving in in a month loads more to do anxiety pretty ad sorry key after v and efore n doesnt work haha depression wavering usually it smacks me in the face in the evening and i cry my heart out feel everyone is out of get me and want to end it though sleep when i can get it improves it a it i have flashes of lighter moods throughout the day usually   finding anxiety is stopping my mostly neck movement so much at the moment its still like pushing it against a force its so hard to look in the direction of anyone else i have the sensation of air eing pushed into my head really forcefully i get tiny involuntary jolts and had all this with a panic attack at my mums yesterday i feel really detached and comined with feeling terrified and like my head will explode is not nice   i worry all the time when im with people re how i look i feel so stiff so wooden cant smile constantly worrying what my expression is like and what others are thinknig fell pretty disgusting when i dont fight to deal with it its especially hard when you make yourself go into town like it and get survey  people in the street saying hello smiler want to scream at them though i try and stay tolerant of these sorts of things and loving of myself to save energy  i didnt rush home wanting to hide my face from everyone i stayed on and got a form i needed in town proud of myself for that   trying so hard to e strong and get this flat thing sorted efore i work again on other improvements in my life  oh here again today after staying up north for a few days going to get a form filled out now and trying to stay strong any posts in response to this would e nice ut i dont feel entitled to it all the time or anything im happy for the lovely comments ive already had on this thread theres no way i can carry on like this its unmanagable cant get around this social phobia dont event know if its that oh  i ended up fighting yesterday and this morning there was a flat viewing this morning and only got out the house in time rushing out in streams of tears oh was going to work and i had no where to go so wandered around the park almost in tears trying to avoid people cause my anxiety was particularly  ad an probably looking like a complete weirdo  the agents are trying to rent this flat out to someone else despite that the state of it is terrble its damp and its full of disrepairs that the landlord has ignored my notifications of im sure no one will actually rent it both windows are completely unusable for christs sake they shouldnt be renting it to anyone but i cant help worrying about the viewings hours before they happen and feeling like i have to spend ages trying tto get it presentable as possible despite the fact that none of it is my fault im constantly worrying abou what the prospective tenants might think of me when they see it how the agents are probably going to be lying their heads off about it all  my anxiety is so bad in public its a complete mind f i just dont know what to do i become completely unable to move properly when i try and move my head from side to side it jolts when anyone gets too near me i feel so uncomfortable that i feel im gonig to explode normal facial expressions feel impossible it feels like my neck and facial muscles have been clamped somehow i cannot smile i cant bear sitting on a bench when people are walknig past i try and relax but i stiffen even more and get incredibly self conscious and can dissociate im terrified of making eye contact and feel completely stripped of any ability to be i feel a million miles removed from any person around me i feel completely insane its so painful and alienating and disconcerting when i go out it really makes me want to top myself sometimes i just have no idea how im going to sort it and make a life for myself itll only be a matter of time before my oh will have to leave me going in and out of hopeless depression  self loathing and paralysing anxiety dissociation stated im working through it best i can i plan to try and get a part time cleaning job where i can be left alone after ive moved and get on a good long term textiledressmaking course as impossible as this feels i forced myself to go for a walk this morning cleaned tidied and ate lunch had some pretty scary thoughts and sensations when out but  know its a given   can someone give advice on how they coped with work with serious health issues i really need to sort ofut some sort of plan theres so much shaming involved with not working but not enough solutions or support for people who want to ut have geniune reasons that dont allow them to   oh finds work very hard and is not where he wants to be due to anxiety and he can cope with a lot more then i can i lose the ability to move properly when strangers are walking near me im also being discharged from my chmt because of the waiting list which i understand completely but its still obvious that at the same time i am going to feel feeling a bit very abandoned as little has improved and ive almost been told to just get on with ti and that the support being taken away is a good thing because itll give me a push i was really surprised that my therapist said this and now feel a it like ive disclosed so much to someone who didnt understand my strife at all a push to getting better is all very well but when im out of my mind with anxiety and other prolems and havent yet found ways to cope with it and its just not getting etter it jsut feels like an insult its pretty hard to describe how alone and desperate im feeling i mean think whatever but dont ever think  im not doing what i can and that im not struggling as much as i say i am or that im just lazy or weak or useless its just not true at all as much as the nasty part of my self would agree and i cannot cope with anyone thinking that until theyve experienced what i have im dealing with so much conflict in my head  i have given a lot to people here whenever i could especially whene i was moderating here and i do feel a bit abandoned and ignored now ut i still come here rambling about the same old crap trying to change but nothings changing nothings ever changing where are the actual solutions  ive also found out that due to circumstances that are by no means the other persons fault they are unlikely to able to help me move on the 5th i actually cant do all the things i have to do on my own physically or mentally id actually have to be two places at once its taken me over 18 months to get the courage to move and this is really hard i started the moving process with the promise of their help and so this is very difficult for the other person and for me i just am not sure what to to do well im now moved i have lots of light a better landlord no damp im in a nicer area i havent quite got over how lucky i am cant believe this is where i live now i start some voluntary work tomorrow also my new surroundings make it easier to create so im working on a few bag designs and when i get my sewing machine working again ill probably be spending hours after hours experimenting i had my last appointment with my therapist yesterday as they decided to bring it to a close the two other members of my cmht have been off for a long time i may see one of them for a few more sessions if they are back before christmas but probably not i feel as if all that help has suddenly been snatched away from me but i completely understand that theres a long waiting list and everyone needs a chance im actually going to see the fall plus the undertones plus bearsuit plus dingus khan in october yes i am mad i cannot cope at all in crowded hot places and still struggle to leave my front door and answer the phone regularly it may well be a disaster but m is looking after me and we have to see the fall when theyre nearby i am so excited life just drains me so much and so easily im pathetic i just dont how how anyone does it at all  i just dont know who i am im starting to think i have serious learning difficulties or something i thought i was fairly intelligent but now i think it was all in my head i think at best im going to be stuck in a crappy job for the rest of my life if i can even cope with that i have no motivation anymore to do much with my art i feel like all skill i thought i had in it was imagined and im never practical enough to use it to earn money a close relative is being very controlling again and putting m down as usual without taking the time to get to know him despite the fact weve been together longer than 4 years i have to have her manipulation pointed out to me now by m as i have such low self esteem and nearly always think whenever someone does something hurtful to me its somehow my fault everyone seems to think im so weird wherever i go i can hardly ever fit in and always feel so torn and resentful overall ive felt much better l since i moved to a massive extent ive been sewing a lot going out more im just about coping with the few hours a week at the charity shop though it really takes its toll on me throughout the day there and its a big struggle i dont really go out on the shop floor and its hard to interact with the people around me but generally im doing so much better today has thrown me though i didnt sleep well last night several seriously horrible dreams and feeling really ill in the night sort of flushed and jumpy and like  i was suffocating like the air around me wasnt good and agitation  the dreams disturbed me a lot especially because of the power i felt that they had when i was dreaming and how they affected several senses it felt like a step up from the usual nightmare and seemed a bit like how i felt at night on pregabalin i woke up sick from tiredness this morning and generally anxious and insecure i managed to get one of things done that i had to in the town centre but then someone reacted to me in a way that triggered me massively everything became a blur and i walked to an isolated spot where i burst into tears and had to call someone for support again i feel stripped of all love and respect to myself and feel sick to my stomach i guess it will pass as usual but this sort of reaction to peoples  judgements is just not practical hi chezza this obviously must be absolutely unbearable for you i know that panic attacks can occur at any time not necessarily directly after a trigger or when apprehensive about an event or situation that is soon approaching but if you dont know what could be causing them at all it must be very confusing and distressing in itself when you say that you dont know what triggers them do you mean that you dont understand the basis for your anxiety at all are you receiving therapy currently sorry for all the questions   i have a history of severe anxiety but only developed full on panic attacks around 4 months ago the first when seeing a relative one at an art therapy group a few weeks ago where i then had to be taken home and a couple that woke me up at night they are not nearly at the degree of severity that yours are but of course very distressing with fast heart beat that seems to pulsate everywhere in my body hysteria and terror and like my limbs are charged with electricity or something and shake violently   keeping in contact with people when you can finding gentle and rewarding things to do when you and generally managing your health as best as you can otherwise is recommended if you arent doing these things already have you tried looking for a specialist in this area or if you cant go private have you seen what other opportunites for help with your panic attacks is available im sorry i cant help more but i feel for you and wish you the best of luck thanks for your responses im sorry to hear that you both have balance problems my balance is ok but its always feels like the way i experience things around me change dramatically  for example climbing up steps etc is really disorientating i get these shooting feelings of panic through my body because im so aware of the space around me and i feel convinced im going to fall and i dont feel in my body properly like im floating up out of it and i cant observe my surroundings properly but i think thats because my muscles get so stiff and im terrified of catching someones eye or having to interact with someone i cant even hold a glass in public with one hand i dont know why but it suddenly feels impossible and i dont trust my hands and get those shooting feelings again the perspective of objects feels wrong as well and i just feel really detached  these feelings only coincide when im around others and therefore experiencing very high anxiety im totally fine at home on my own and when im with my boyfriend i can hardly move a lot of the time too if people are around me i literally freeze cant move a muscle for fear this has been going on for so so long it never gets taken seriously because it sounds so crazy  ive been not far from housebound for 4 years all i can do is study from home and make stuff to sell online which is failing miserably too i have regular panic attacks  every symptom of agoraphobia but my new psychiatrist just says i have depression and anxiety i recently got referred to the cmht again after being suddenly dropped ages ago  im waiting to get help from an occupational therapist who my cpn thought would be very good for me ive lost everyone but my boyfriend whos been incredible my parents dont understand my brothers dont understand i cant work i cant have friends im completely useless and carrying on in this same monotony over and over is killing me i really need treatment from a dentist too i cant sleep because of the toothache at the moment but agoraphobia makes it impossible to go somewhere like a dentists  i just wish it would make more sense and i could know what to do  best wishes to both of you liz i hope things have improved somewhat since you last posted i really relate  creating stuff has always been the only thing im really interested in and a way of coping and feeling good about myself i wanted to go to art school but it never happened im unemployed doing a tiny bit of voluntary work where i hide from everyone have agoraphobia severe social anxiety and depression i do a city and guilds distance learning course but never feel like i can really get my creativity going again i feel full of doubts about everything i make and know its not very good i wonder if i ever had that much potential at all i never get that energy that ive had before whilst making stuff im constantly trying to create hoping it will eventually jumpstart my creatvity again but it never happens i think previous medications have made it a lot worse i have such bad concentration and motivation and approach making art in such a scared way now and always end up wanting to burn it to get all the confusion i have surrounding it out of my brain  anyway youre obviously very talented and have a lot of horrible stuff to deal with i really hope you can work something out i think its worth saying that you probably are doing better than you think and i guess all sorts of talented artists have mental health problems though i know its not particularly helpful  best of luck xx depression and anxiety continuing to destroy me  ive got my atos reassessment appointment tomorrow at 2 delayed in jan due to the snow but theres snow again now havent been told its cancelled this time though m is kindly coming with me and will try to keep his cool during my interview as i dont have anyone in charge of my care anymore i have a letter from my fantastic caring gp to take though  several nights of waking up in a blind panic distraught about my fd up life family who are ashamed of me and dont understand and so i feel completely and utterly torn apart a horrible all consuming mh problem that means i cant have any sort of life and that its barely worth living combined with people who either probably think im making it up for a laugh or struggle to understand even a small percentage of how this stuff affects me which with the latter isnt their fault at all i just wish i didnt feel so hugely alienated by it   as usual incredibly difficult to leave my flat though m is lovingly putting up with me as always still doing a day a week in a charity shop which adds to the depression and is very stressful being in close proximity with others but at least im volunteering a bit in the week  i have applied for something more interesting partially through guilt in what im doing with my life and also because if i was more on top of things i know i would be good at it and find it very rewarding but now im dreading being contacted about it because it largely involves using the phone and im terrified of making and recieving calls im nowhere near well enough to do it but i just want to be  i have my dl textile course stuff but i always get so frustrated with myself when doing the work and my creativity is totally dried up as always totally doubting any ability i might have in textile stuff im shit really i really fight to get any motivation going now and it is unlikely to ever go anywhere especially being so socially phobic m is planning to move in which is one very good thing  the help for what i deal with just isnt really there and so few people understand what my anxiety actually does to me i really really need help or advice to help my anxiety  how i can get some paid work with my problems and messed up education and lack of experience its something thats worrying me so much its going to be harder and harder its really making me suicidal because i feel so helpless about it im not sure if theres a reason why people dont respond to me on here anymore obviously people dont have to respond to me and im sorry for going on about the same things all the time but i cant really vent anywhere else although ive been taking more than giving on here now i did moderate here for a time and feel like maybe someone could say something im really a nice person in a horrible place and just want someon e to believe me or help believe or not i dont llike whinging i just want to be able to know theres a way out and how i could do it really depressive couple of days cant stop crying going to bed really early have hardly any energy dont feel able to do anything feel pathetic hating myself really confused but determined to get a bit back on track today ms having a hard time with his job and depression too and im just constantly crying and saying how stuck i feel and needing his help which i cant keep doing   i have to request a document from job centre today and then will go on to the charity shop if i am up to it m thinks im wasting my time with the charity shop thing and that it isnt helping me but i need to do something outside of my course stuff from home if i can keep going with it for a bit more maybe i can just get a part time cleaning job somewhere where i can work alone   i need to keep going whatever happens well i now work an afternoon in a charity shop just so im out and helping i go to a therapeutic art group during the week its not getting any easier in fact i would say my anxiety is getting worse if thats possible and im getting very frequent suicidal thoughts mainly in response to this which i try to say stop to and see as a dramatic learned reaction to stress but more than often let myself be dragged into it all    i went to a group induction session for a distance learning course ive recently signed up to i wanted so much to be able to cope with it and get on with the things i want to be doing in my life but i just crumbled i cannot even begin to describe how i feel when i get like this i unwittingly spend so much time trying to make sense of it all i know this isnt wise but you develop a massive distrust of your mind and body and a huge sense of isolation especially around people its only natural that im going to want to try and understand it   i think i lose about 80 percent of my ability to move my body i sort of turn into a board i try and move normally feel relaxed and smile at people but i literally cannot move at this point i might as well be trying to get it to do an impossible contortion i honestly think i suffer from a fear induced paralysis but not many people would take this seriously my body sort of judders if try to move it too much and i feel amazingly uncomfortable i just feel so horrible about myself when im like that compeltely unresponsive to peoples conversation around me wanting to introduce myself and be nice but unable to even meet anyones eyes   anyway i was very intent on getting through this its so so important to me i really dont know what sort of life i have ahead of me i eventually became so distressed and managed to get my tutors attention she came out with me and i burst into tears shaking unable to look at her my whole body broke out in a rash i was sweating my legs felt charged with electricity i know this is a panic attack but the stiffness and massive uneasiness around others is constant its like the panic just simmers constantly before boiling over at the slightest added stress im pretty sure everyone heard me crying i had to go home and everyone seemed so nice it was just awful i should be going back tomorrow i feel so defeated i just want this to stop so much ive just become this carrier for fear something aimless being tossed around in the ocean cheesy but accurate i struggle to keep a strong sense of who i am   its been putting strain on my relationship with my boyfriend for so long hes the only person i can be myself around which is obviously as massive a problem for him as it is for me im so so lucky hes stayed around so long hes incredibly tolerant of me and i just want our relationship to be rewarding instead of a desperate struggle all the time its so painful to be like this to be another crap thing he has to deal with in his life to not be part of the rest of his interests to be with his friends im so sure that eventually hell just have to drift away to be trying your utmost hardest for someone you love but also to realise that its just not good enough is too painful to bear just been at the shop this afternoon glad i went and helped i find it so hard to look at people and make conversation though i panic when anyone looks at me and dont really dare look up from what im doing everything just feels so intense around me and i feel like im going to explode managed a brief chat with a couple of people though this morning on the way there walking through crowds i felt close to passing out with fear but it got a bit better throughout the day its as if my whole body becomes ultra sensitive noises affect me more movement around me makes me feel dizzy constantly on edge when i was waiting to cross the road i got this horrible feeling that i was somehow going to walk out into the traffic not because i wanted to but just this feeling that i was going to do it without meaning to i had this while sitting on a train platform a couple of months ago and was clutching the bench like an idiot its terrifying   looking out my window at a beautiful full moon right now and ms just going to the shop to get a few things so i can cook tea am making a few kantha and sashiko embroidery samples and doing a colour study thanks so much poppy and i will do  x  a friend although extremely understanding of all my severe anxiety problems generally holds the view that dealing with fears and anxieties is about emotional intelligence not that he sees me as emotionally unintelligent in general he sees me as perceptive and caring i think but he does see this stuff almost 100 as a question of logic this is hard for me to process considering the blinding physical and mental symptoms i experience that have been pushing me to hide away from the world for a long time and ruined my life in so many ways and of course i think most people with social phobia are naturally very sensitive and have experienced things that have caused them to lose a hell of a lot of selfesteem and to fear social interaction but the emotional intelligence idea is important in that it places the power firmly in my hands  its just unbelievable how many stupid little avoidance tactics feels more like selfpreservation really i employ throughout the day for the small periods of time i am out in the world to cope with the social phobia and how in a lot of ways they make so little sense eg crossing the road when there are people on the path so that i dont have to acknowledge themask to get past walking behind cars that are about to turn when im crossing the road instead of catching their eye to see if theyll let me pass posting something from the one po i feel comfortable going to instead of say taking a form in by hand to the dentists that is about 5 minutes walk away because im terrified of going in that particular place on my own not picking up items on a shopping list that are on an aisle where people are chatting by could go on forever sometimes i cant even identity the exact fear pushing me to make these little changes in behaviour i have to work at these bit by bit but the terror of letting go of them is inexpressable i will get there though  but anyway thanks again for all your support  youre all lovely hi katy  1 yes i do same with women of any size im slim and slight and ive had people talk about real women being bigger and curvier which is just nonsensical we are what we are and as long as were healthy thats fine i think everyone has to remember that other individuals size is not really any of our business and doesnt affect us  2 i honestly wouldnt think anything of it and as others have said obviously theres not one perfect body im much more interested in what the persons like and im usually focusing and panicking on how i appear to others to even notice much at all  3 again i think the perfect body is a healthy one one that functions well so often the body is talked about in terms of appearance and not valued for how incredible it is biologically if you know what i mean appearances are just shells  4 i dont think anything in particular about them some people are naturally slim due to their metabolism others take unnatural methods to try and achieve skinnyness when its not whats right for their body and sadly i can completely see how it happens when slimness is generally put across as the ideal  5 someone who was quiet in a conversation id probably be drawn to them and feel a connection in the sense that neither of us would be saying much i find people that talk a lot very hard to approach not that its a bad thing at all just that its so different to me it feels too intense  6 it someone appears not to have knowledge on a topic being discussed i might think they just werent interested or just that they hadnt come across the knowledge yet or nothing i would only think badly of someone displaying a lack of knowledge in something if they acted very arrogantly about the subject and werent open to reason or learning more about it its easy to think something you know is obvious when you know it but everyone has to learn things at some point knowledge isnt just there of course  i actually feel insecure about my lack of knowledge in a lot of areas i try and remedy this by simply trying to learn more stuff but it can be overwhelming sometimes and everyone finds some things easier to understand than others for example im not a practical person and i feel like an idiot when it comes to things like economics maths science and just daily practicalities that seem to come so easily to others and i overrthink stuff  best wishes katy i have social anxiety too and its a massive struggle that affects so much take care

      "hi rob   this is an interesting point day dreaming or escapism in the dictionary is often explained as the tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities especially by seeking entertainment or engaging in fantasy  however they can be negative almost everyone day dreams as they also dream when they sleep it is part of the human condition   some people use it to inspire creativness such as artists or writers some people use it as an escape from reality such as my regular daydreams of winning the lottery   however i have had negative daydreams myself the other day i daydreamed that my husband had died from being shot i dreamt about it happening other peoples reactions my reaction going to hospital the hospital staff the funeral everything it was awful and i worked myself into a state doing it crying and everything    i guess for me the key is looking at and analysing the theme of the daydream rather than the actual content and the feelings that i was left with afterwards the feelings i had after that daydream was anguish anxiety and a fear of abandonment the fear that he should suddenly leave my life unexpectedly i guess this was easier for me to do because over the years i have come to learn that i do have quite severe anxiety and abandonment issues and this was just coming out in my daydream   maybe if you look at your common recurring themes and the feelings you feel afterwards you might come to some sort understanding of what they mean to you   i know that daydreaming can be a sign of post traumatic stress disorder but i can not say that is what you are suffering with i thought it would be likely that you would suffer from other symtoms though but i am not a medicalpsychiatric professional to get that diagnosis you would have to consult a professional   most times when it is an unpleasant daydream i am conscious enough to know when to stop it i stop it by concentrating on reality and grounding myself and filling my thoughts with more positive things like looking at photos of happy times or watching a comedy or cooking anything really   with regards to your mum only you have the power to find that out but it might be worth looking at why you feel that way could it be a misplaced feeling it might be worth looking at whether that feeling is what is coming out in your daydreams   to be honest if it is causing you huge distress i would speak to your gp about it to put your mind at rest they might have suggestions or refer you on to someone else to help   i hope that helps\n",

      "hi cbtish  thank you for replying  i came off the meds about 67 weeks ago and the withdrawl symptoms seem to have finally disappeared im probably being a bit dim but what do you mean by readjustment do you mean trying to come to terms with the return of symptoms or worry about managing without meds perhaps  thanks also for your information about support from the cmht for patients having private therapy i am still seeing the nhs psych  although id like to dump this service as he is alarming me greatly  but have not been offered anything else  before coming off the meds i didnt need anything but have felt panickyanxious and this has increased to high levels of alarm at timeslike after seeing the nhs psych  do you think they would offer me support between therapy sessions i have therapy once a week it would help to know there was someone i could talk to if i became seriously anxious the psych told me that if the anxiety returned i should see my gp and go back on the adsbut i dont want to do that id rather deal with the anxiety in therapy which is easier to do now that the ads are no longer masking it sorry have rambled on thank you for listening x\n",

      "miss kitty  thank you for your reply   i had a total hysterectomy and removal of both ovaries about 2 years ago  i went through an immediate surgically induced menopause  i had a fibroid as big as a melon and my left ovary had a 10cm cyst and my right ovary had started to become abnormal  the consultant said i was the equivalent to 5 months pregnant  i was very lucky actually not to have cancer as it was suggested that it could be phew   i was getting about 12 hot and cold sweats a day due to this surgical intervention so my gp put me on progesterone patches  the hot flushes and my mood did improve i only get 2 or 3 a day now  one minute im sweating like mad and the next im cold  these are however different to my social blushing  i suppose i should look on the bright side i could blame it on my menopause  when i had my surgery my family were really supportive  to me however it wasnt as bad as the suffering i get with depression  i couldnt believe it actually oh i have been through a big ordeal open surgery  a doddle in comparison   im glad your depression and anxiety has lessened with age mine had until recently im just so tired all the time and feel teary and cant concentrate etc im not suicidal though like i was for a long time so that is a blessing  fingers crossed i wont get to that   yes it does seem like a well worn path i feel as though i lost about 10 years i felt as though i was literally in a parallel universe and i didnt have an identity  i feel more grounded now though\n",

from for certain people for instance somebody with schizophrenia cannot just make there schizophrenicness vanish  its not going to just disappear    i have known i had some kind of md for basically my whole life and i know for sure that its never going to go away it is who i am it makes up my personality  my soul and my being if it went away i would no longer be me     i dont mind some of the symptoms much but others bother me very much   things i do mind  1the way i cant have my skin rubbed the wrong way or i have to rub it back i think its because of the way my hair goes but even then places with no hair are the same    2 the way i have to count syllables in my head repeatedly  every which way and sequence its not even that i have to its that i cant help it i fight myself to stop   3 the anxious feeling i get when i am around people sometimes i am afraid to talk sometimes i just want to get away from them and go lay down or color or write i dont like to watch movies with people i watch them by myself comfortably  with the lights dimmed and even then i pause it several times whether it be to get something to eat or drink to get up for different reasons or to adjust myself because i am uncomfortable   4i have to briefly think about things before they come out of my mouth most of the time but not with certain people that i am comfortable with i am afraid of what they might think if say something the wrong way i want to be nice to people most of the time lately i have found same weird anger in myself that makes me want to ignore people and not talk to them or i dont care about what they are saying to me because i just want to get away from them i never used to feel that way i was a people person  and i still am at times i am also getting better at declining peoples offers and invites   i often push away possible friends due to anxiety and avoid making plans with people because i dont want to do them and i have a hard time declining i have a hard time keeping plans and goals i find it hard to function normally throughout my days its hard to take care of myself and do things i need to do i do things at the spure of the moment when i am comfortable if i am not comfortable doing it when i do i do it wrong and mess everything up and feel nervous and distracted and fall apart i dread anyone saying that i want everything to go my way because i dont and i am not selfish its just that i need things to go a certain way sometimes i need to set my own pace and order  and i want to know how things are going to work   5 the blinking of my eyes in every which way and darting my eyes around i follow lines and textures with my eyes until it feels right it causes head aches worse than the ones i get every single day anyway i know that i strain my eyes but thats my bodys  doing because of astigmatism  but my brain makes me strain my eye muscles to keep up with the blinking that i do for some reason and again i have to fight myself to stop 6  i dont like to have my colothes wedged into any place on my body especially under my arms my underwear being the exception  although as a young child you couldnt pay me to wear them because of that reason which i was unaware of at the time  7 i have to click my teeth together for beats and syllables  it also causes head aches as a young child my father would tell me i grinded my teeth at night i dont know why in the past 6 or so years i have sometimes waken up doing it and felt it and i also wet the bed but grew out of it at the age of 11  8 if i step on a certain texture or temepurature with one foot i often have to do the same with my other in the same way if i dont get the same feeling i have to make a new one i quickly find a new spot big enough for both of my feet and step on it with both simultaneously and the same with my hands if i stretch out or bend my fingers on one hand then i must do it the same way with the the same fingers on my other hand 9 if i scratch anything anything at all i have to squeeze the end of my finger and pull off of it as if wiping something out from under my nail or on the top sometimes i have to do it several times to each and i have to get them all right and the same way or i have to start over it causes my nails to crack and become extremely painful i have to keep my nails short to keep them from cracking  but keeping them short makes the weird feeling worse and more frequent  the feeling of something under my nails i can even think about the feeling and instantly feel it and have to fix it which is terrible because i cant get  thoughts out of my head if i think about them and challenge myself subconsciously  11 sometimes i think about harming myself again i am definitely done with that but i just remember the feelings i got when i did it it really did make me feel good i liked doing it and i liked looking at it after and my scars sometimes i am jelouse of people that successfully committed suicide i could never bring myself to do it i dont want to die but sometimes i feel like its what i want in my worst moments i am also jelouse that they had the courage to do it and how sympathethetic people are to them people i know would be mad and think bad things i dont want to leave the ones i love  i am very curious to know what happens when you die if anything and if god takes me to heaven or hell but i definitely would not do it and i wont    i could go on and all day and all night but ill stop here i feel like there are an infinate number of things   things i dont mind  1 the self harming i have been doing this for as long as i can remember  it passes time and keeps me occupied i enjoy it moderated like i actually have a project going it causes head aches of i do it too long but i am able to make myself stop if i can find something else to do and sometimes i try to convince myself that its worth it or that my head ache isnt very close though it is  2 songs or just one or two song verses playing my my head over and over again throughout my entire day i mind it sometimes like if i dont like that song  but then i can just play one that i like to get some lines in my head to replace the ones i had before i will have them regardless so i have to do it very rarely in wont have one in my head but there is always something  sometimes the song will merge with another or i will get lyrics wrong  or forget some lyrics or even forget most of the lines i even replace forgotten words with new ones that sound right and i click my teeth to the words or beat sometimes  there are more but i just cant think of them    as afraid as i am of being normal because i would no longer be me i do want relief maybe i could try medication but i dont know if my fiance would support it and approve he does not understand my issues he knows me well for the most part  and has issues of his own as well i just dont know how he would feel he almost never takes medicine of any kind and sometimes hints at disapproval when i take pain pills for head aches and stuff i want to help myself but it is also very important for me to respect him his views and wishes as it is for him  i would also have to see a doctor i have major major anxiety when it comes to doing official things i dont even have a drivers license or an id because of anxiety and then i would have to go through talking to the doctor and telling himher everything and explaining myself and for some reason i have this weird fear that doctors are always on edge looking drug abusers and that they might consider me and then not give me any medication or they wont beleive me or tell me that i dont have any md and i am just normal or have no diagnosis this is really affecting my life i need help i cant even get a job right now and i need one i have a lot of the same anxieties as you i have been working on getting a job for months not exactly working on it but stressing over it    i was in the public transit with my wallet and all important papers ss card birth cert transcript i left it in the bus because i am forgetful and it got stolen it was not turned in to the bus driver    i was going to go to an open interview and possible get hired the very next day ever since then  i have not tried very hard to get any of it back i just dont have it in me i have been through it and being off he grid makes it so much harder i have never had an actual id   i asked my father if he could get them for me and he said he is but he is a lot like me so i dont know he sent app for my birth cert now waiting for it and then he said he will be getting my ss card    i understand how hard it can be and just like you i dont know what to do my fiance works his butt off every single day pulling 12 hour shifts and working over time every night and day and just whenever he can while i sit at home sulk and bask in my worthlessness i feel like a statue just there to look pretty and not actually serve any real purpose  not actually doing anything productive to contribute    i wish i had answers for us both just keep trying i guessmaybe start taking your meds again good luck hey    just want to let you know i understand and would not judge you infact i find it rather difficult to not judge normal  thinking people i just dont understand how they can be the way they are just so normal and they live life in a regular way they get through their days and move onto the next we think differently  we actually notice things and think about things and think about something other than whats going on at work or what our friends are up to i believe that we are smarter and more insightful in many ways and that we are capable of more complex thoughts and emotions     when i started reading your post i realized how much it sounds like me it actually helped remind me that i am not alone that i am not the odd ball of the world  i too picture myself dying and dead every single day not a day goes by that i dont think about dying and what if i died what if i got hit by a truck today what if i was in a car with my loved ones and we all got killed or if they all lived and i got killed or if they all got killed and i lived what if my fiances father decided to shoot me with his many guns or even when i am shooting a gun what if i turned around and shot everyone behind me there lives are in my hands and they trust mei could kill them or my life is in his handshe could kill me    different thoughts and scenarios play in my head each day all day repeatedly  i want to be normal but at the same time i wouldnt be myself if i was    i think i want to spend all my time by myself when i get anxious and then i do i usually sleep then i wake up starving for company  i want to avoid social situations and sometimes i spend to much time alone    when i spend time with my fiance i will often start crying over nothing i am constantly paranoid  i am always afraid of what others may think about me i am afraid of being judged by my actions and words like if i dont say the same things they would say or choose to do the same things they would choose to do   something that definitely helps me is animals whether it be a dog  cat horse rodent etc they will never judge you they dont notice the little weird things you do they are just as weird as you they wont tell your secrets and they will always love you as long as you love them try getting a dog or a cat a cat would probably be your best bet because cats are loving but at the same time very self relient they can take care of themselves if you need to fall down as long as you have them food and water at hand and a litter box available    dogs take more work a dog may be good for you if you want to challenge yourself to get up and out and do more they love attention and love giving it they are great friends     or you could start small with a rat or gerbil many people are afraid of rats and think they are dirty rats from a pet store are very kind very intelligent very clean and are great friends in many ways alike with a dog they are social creatures and they like us humans they are good pets and friends     please dont get an animal and then not take care of it animals do take some work only keep an animal if you are sure you can provide proper care for that animal    that is my advice maybe take it into consideration of you have not already and i wish you the best of luck acorn  it is just in your mind the government is not on our forums and if they were they would clearly see that your notfalsly claiming benefits  and that you indeed do have a work ablitlty impairing mental disorder    my grandma is always worried that her son and daughter  my aunt and uncle are going to loose there benefits and medications of they go outside and basically if they do anything other than sit around the house    this has kept them both from experiencing life and doing things for themselves  they do nothing but sit around the house they are both smart and capable i doing things but they dont even realize it they are blinded by the fear that she has out into them due to paranoia    coming from methat is saying something  i am paranoid of everything  so just relax you will be fine\n",

      "this will be a long post but ill try to make it as short as i can   my family and friends all think ive been missdiagnosed because both of my psychiatrists refuse to pay attention to my story im starting to see a new one the 22nd of this month but i dont know how to explain everything to him and hopefully you can guide me better because they only focus on one aspect    im 23 years old when i was 8 i started to think all of my friends hated me and were picking on me things like that even though they said they werent i lost all of those friends still have none to this day and it continued to get worse from there just feeling like people didnt like me were talking behind my back staring at me etc it progressed to the point when i was 16 that i stopped being able to leave the house in fact since then ive only ever left to see doctors ive never been able to have a relationship a job or anything like that when i leave the house i feel like everyones going to attack me if im inside and i see the mailman for example i have to hide until i see him go away because of my thoughts about him everynight i would have a panic attack starting in the morning that would slowly build up through the day until i was hyperventilating and would cry myself to sleep i never saw a doctor for that because of my father he basically said suck it up be more like your brother so it just continued to get worse my dad started getting sick and around that time i started noticing that as my panic attack got worse through the day i would start to hear and see things but realize they werent real then my dad passed away and everything got alot worse i started constantly feeling like i was in that panic attack state stopped feeling real feeling like im watching a movie not living and the things i would see and hear became more frequent and my thoughts started being very negative but it was like i couldnt control them finally my mother decided she should take me to a doctor our family doctor and she put me on paxil and clonazepam the clonazepam had no effect so she tried ativan i think its called then valium and then alprazolam none of them had any effect on me the paxil made it so i couldnt feel sad anymore i just feel empty now and no matter what cannot cry so my doctor took me off but its been 6 months since then and that hasnt went away i went to my first psychiatrist and he said i have an anxiety disorder and put me on buspar and abilify he said everything was because of my fathers death completely ignored how ive had this since i was 8 and its just gotten worse well those medications also had no effect so my doctor recommended a different psychiatrist but he did more of the same just said its anxiety from my fathers death thats it my family doctor said theres nothing more she can do for me so im off medication now but continuing to get worse lately the few things i had that i enjoyed just bring more negative thoughts and emotion so instead i find myself sitting somewhere just thinking about everything and it will turn out ive been there for hours at a time   everyone thinks the doctors are wrong i realize i do have anxiety but i dont think its the cause of everything like they do how do i get my psychiatrist to really understand that this isnt because of my fathers death but that just continued to worsen whatever is wrong with me and if anyone can say what my symptoms i guess sound like id appreciate it i purposely havent been looking into it as i would assume the worst im not sure what cbt is so i assume i havent had that my one psychiatrist did have me do some therapy things but again they were more negative than positive by far he said i had to get mysleep rhythm there was some large word i cant remember and to start exposing myself to things that i had a fear of he had me sleep in the dark  havent been in the darkever and force myself outside and had me stop playing games and watching movies but all that ended up happening was i wasnt able to sleep for a few days and since i dont have any sort of life without games  movies to pass the time i just kinda sat there so he had me stop doing it until they found a medication that would help me with it as far as what my family thinks my mother says i just have depression but i guess mainly they think they are wrong because the medicine didnt do anything im not from the uk though i wish i was im in the middle of nowhere america surrounded by miles and miles of cornfield  id rather not change my family doctor since she knows me well i live in a really small town but on the 22nd when i go see my new psychiatrist i can mention the cbt and see if he offers it and i cant say i think therapy would help or not i dont know what to expect with it honestly if its more of just do what scares you it probably wont work a random example of how bad my anxiety or fears are i have a medical condition where im suppose to be constantly on very strong pain medication and my whole life ive just put up with the pain because im afraid of becoming addicted to the pain killers so it would have be something besides just face your fears and its not that i want a pill to just make things better but being 23 with no money or anything to my name and never being able to work or have a lifeim desperate for a change fast because my mother isnt in the best of health and if something happens to her shes basically my safety net i would have nothing no way of living wow lots of comments ill reply to each of you as best i can   nicorettegummed i looked into it and yeah that does seem very similar in a few regards but it seems to heavily imply the person would be suicidal which i am far from i cant even honestly say for sure im depressed just that the anti depressants i was put on made me feel empty   schizolanza yeah i told both of my previous ones they said it was from the anxiety and the fact that they increased after my fathers death was normal and as far as the hallucinations they arent constant only when for example im walking through my house at night and i cant stop thinking theres somebody in the kitchen and ill have a day dream i can still see everything fine but i imagine someone there but i know its not real thought it still scares me i thought for schizophrenia it happened all of the time and you couldnt tell it was a hallucination because i can defiantly tell nobody could possibly be in the kitchen so i know i didnt just really experience that   lilac i will gladly look into it an update about everything i just got back from my first appointment with my new psychiatrist right away i can honestly say this one seems different so i have allot of hope with this new one he said because i seem to be immune to things like xanax hes going a different route and put me on what he called a desperation medicine so he put me on neurontin only 100mg because i was so worried about it but 3 times a day and hes having me call him on wednesday so i can say if the medicine still worries me and if it doesnt he will up the dose he took away my diagnosiss and said whatever i have it doesnt matter hes going to focus on the symptoms and the anxiety is the first one has anyone had any sort of experience with this medicine they can share  edit  i also cant seem to be able to edit the original post but i just wanted to update for everyone\n",

      "learn to dissociate and then when the pain comes you cant feel it oh sorry was that you in between us  i am sorry we didnt mean to upset you he was whistling at me as i made eyes at him from across the roadin my dreams   i am finding that its best to see the funny bits of a distressing situation if you can of course it helps if you have a wierd sense of humour sounds to me that maybe your nans house has got a lack of air circulation or a possible carbon monoxide build up in your bedroom   have a look at this   httpwwwbbccoukhealthphysicalonoxide1shtml i had more or less the same nightmare 34 times a week for nearly the last 40 years since i got really deep down depressed again last october i have had it written down and tried to analyse it with the help of my therapist we found that it was a reflection or memory story of what happened to me in a mental hospital which caused me to suffer from ptsd took a while working it out but now i have it has helped me enormously in trying to recover from the ptsd  and dissociation i suffer from   as angiebib1976 i wonder if it is the same or similar nightmares you should try to write them down to help you ananlyse them mine had absolutely nothing to do with meds i seem to have had a few they are a very simple test where they just apply lots of sticky bits on your torso and see what is happening heart wise the last one i had was just before i went into hospital for a minor op just to see if everything was fine which it was not sure why they do it really cos i am a simple bod as can be seen by the way this response is written i sometimes have panic attacks whilst driving my landrover but its so old and rickety and bounces around a lot that from the outside you cant tell i keep shaking and feel like my head is nodding and i cant stop it for ages i feel tearful and rotten is this anxiety or what i used to be afraid of dying but now i think itll be interesting are my senses of my dead loved one all an ideal dream   i am dying to find out    no reason though to experience it before my time is up   happy life i have been on sertraline for nearly 2 years now i suffer from depression and ptsd    i feel ok with it and will stay on it for quite a while yet as according to my gp i have suffered from depression for a long time including 3 particular deep episodes i was very anxious   i am now hopefully in recovery taking  sertraline has had no negative effects occasionally i have reduced it if i was going out on the beer but returned to it after   this is not to say i have been well because antidepressants seem to just relieve my depressions but they definitely dont totally take the causes of it away   you need to determine what alternatives there are from your gp   14 years ago when i was first diagnosed with ptsd having suffered it unknown to me for the previous 26 years i was first given prozac  which within 2 weeks turned me into a nervous wreck it was switched to sertraline and it worked for me   inho it doesnt seem to be worth taking any antidepressant for only a few months unless of course you expect the cause of your problems to somehow disappear in quick time   also i think if you are considering herbal remedies you only do so after expert advice because there are chemicals within herbals that disturb some antidepressants please talk to your gp 15 a month  x 12  180 a year that is far more than i pay for my prescriptions so i hope you are not making the case for herbals to be cheaper which they are definitely not   i take lots of pills so i get my yearly certificate for 104 for everything    i suffer from a lot of things which i take pills for i dont believe that naturals are good for you just by being natural when people of hundreds of years ago didnt have access to todays chemical compounds they used to die a lot sooner in a lot of pain too imagine having toothache 500 years ago yuk all natural herbals are in fact chemicals derived from plants and such but they are still chemicals you know    i too am a product of nature but according to half the population of the world i am unnatural so i suppose it is appropriate that i should take so called un natural compounds  herbal medicine risks harmful sideeffects  telegraph  herbal medicine  cancer research uk  cancerhelp uk i love spiders so much i make sure they have lots of big cobwebs in my house so that they can catch all those horrible flying things which i hate buzzing around annoying me   i think spiders are nice quiet creatures i even have a string of toilet roll down into my bath so that if a spider falls into bath they have a way out it is called globous hystericus   globus sensation   doctor   patientcouk i have dont really have dreams i tend to have nightmares  due to the fact that when i am over stressed i readily dissociate i often cannot tell the difference between a dream and reality   i have dreams that are so real that when i wake up i am convinced that whatever the dream was about actually happened   and vice versa of course when something actually does happen and i remember it later i cant work out if it was all a dream  i dreamt something happened 41 years ago and believed it so completely i lived my life by it and only found out it did not happen 2 years ago with the best wishes in the world but i just checked your thread starters and cant find one that has not been replied to  maybe nobody is on propananol and you have only got 10 posts you need to get involved a bit more hi rage i get these jolts regularly  unlike you i know what they are though they are physical body memories ptsd flashbacks of the actual electric body shocks i was subjected to 40 years ago   maybe your jolts are some form of flashback from something which happened to you in the past which is also unconsciously causing your anxiety my anxiety was provoked by the therapy that i went through in 1972   i was kindly given anxiety as the main point of having electric shock aversion therapy to cure me of my disease of homosexuality the main point of the shock punishments was to make me anxious in the presence of males thereby putting me off wanting sex with them i was taught to be extremely anxious in any situation when males are present  this lovely treatment was meant to make me go running into the safe arms of a woman  this may have something to do with the fact that i cannot relate to male medical practicianers but always prefer talking to female therapists   i had a session with a male doctor in hospital a few weeks ago and when he wrote to my gp he said i was a pleasant but rather anxious man   i love the safe arms of a woiman but do not want sex with them and am unable to have sex with men because i always get too anxious  fucking brilliant to give me this to add to the ptsddissociation and depression that the aversion therapy gave me i keep seeing the bastard behind me in the corner of my eye but when i turn around to ask him what the fuck are you looking at the bastard always seems to have dissappeared no wait a minute he is still there in the corner of my eye  i wish my eyes were just round like everybody elses and then the bastard couldnt hide in the corner  fuckfuckfuclfiuclkfckfufkflkugirntb oi still there i knowill turn out the light and hell be gone ffffuki fell over the dog in the darksorry pooch quoteianol288112 so what happens if i mix the sertraline with alcohol   quote   i have had no problems mixing sertraline with alcohol i was on it for 2 years in 19982000 and back on it now though i only drink a couple of pints nowadays and very very rarely get drunk tried it like beer and love an ice cool gin and tonic so if i had to be honest i will carry on cos i like it it is the alcohol that is the anti depressant not beer per se so each to their own i gave up smoking from 30 a day rather than giving up drinking as id rather be occasionally drunk rather than coughing every morning with my breakfast coffee but as i say each to their own   though i am sure that smoking and taking drugs probably doesnt harm one as much as drinkdrugs hi apo although i gave up smoking i am not anti smoking and i dont mind sitting next to smokers in the pub i can get my smoking done then without costing me anything i gave up primarily for financial reasons though i am undoubtedly better off for it before being successful i must have tried to give up every new years day for 20 years and every time i gave up id put a bit of weight on and everytime i strarted again id lose about half of it so i got fatter and fatter and would no doubt have exploded myself eventually had i not been for once resolute    i used to go rock climbing and always had a fag in my gob in those especially difficult bits    ill probably start again near to retirement so i can get a bigger pension\n",

      "hi sunshine50   sorry that you are struggling so much ive had some issues myself and was booked in for the double whammy last weekgastroscopy and colonoscopy but chickened out at the last minute   a doctor should be able to explain the report to you and provide an explanation as to why you need a follow up in 2 months anxiety can cause some pretty intense physical symptoms but its good that things are being followed up to rule out other physical causes   hope others can provide more info im a law abiding citizen too and still get highly stressed around the police in fact i managed to ruin a tyre on my car as i was so far over to the side of the road that i ripped the side of my tyre like shredded it just because there was an oncoming police car we can not diagnose on this site but it is possible that your feelings are as a result of some form of anxiety related response  i think anyone would feel uneasy about being followed by the police so try not to be too hard on yourself but if it is really impacting your life then seek appropriate professional support im going to go out on a limb here and say i hope your step daughter is not expecting you to use the same bath water because thats gross like you i hate baths i hate not being able to stretch out and it also triggers me as i have some major hang ups about myselfbut thats a whole other thread  would you consider having a shower when you stay over  i also like the suggestion of some trackie pants and the t shirt if that makes you comfortable  just be mindful that its not good for you to hold on that if you ignore your bodys signs you could very well end up constipated fwiw i think most people can feel uncomfortable about no 2 when away from home hi abc123    alcohol is a depressant so it will naturally make you feel more down   welcome imo its a common misconception that quiche is healthy as unfortunately its not its loaded with eggs cheese butter and cream so if you are looking at overall calorie content its probably one of the more unhealthy choices granted its high in protein and probably calcium from the cheese but otherwise not a healthy food choice for want of a better expression i hate mondays too could not have said it better myself in fact ive got happy tears as i type how are you feeling now linc have things settled to is your anxiety still through the roof i hope you get some rest lincoln and the temazepam helps you get some rest yes linc it can but if you are drinking more than one cup a day dont stop it cold turkey just reduce the amount gradually yep gets a bit like that sometimes  have you heard back from anyone yet about support are you going to bake the red velvet cake how are you feeling now did you manage to get any rest hopefully you are back inside and a little drier and warmer i can relate to the lack of sleep its horrible isnt it i was startled awake by a very upsetting dream at 5am and was still awake at 1 even although i went to bed at 10pm  what are you feeling confused about would talking about it help i hope the gp appt goes well try and be as honest as you can the more they know about how you are feeling at the moment the better equipped they are to help you hi magpie  sorry to hear you are feeling that way do you know whats making you feel so stressed about work hi magpie   sorry things are so difficult for you at the minute your meds will take time to kick in and things might feel worse before they get better but give them a chance keep posting we are here for you im so agitated at the minute i just wish i could calm myself down i dont have any meds left  i cant stop thinking about my pdoc and whats been talked about in therapy i hugged him at the end of out session yesterday and its just really messed with my head ive been struggling to talk in therapy over the past month and im just not sure what to do  i cant distinguish between what happened vs what i think happened all of it but mostly the hug as i just want to hug him again and i know thats really messed up thx for all your help i had typed out responses to your post but it just didnt seen right he should never have allowed me to hug him and now im just hoping that we can still continue therapy without major problems i have never thought of myself as suffering anxiety but for the past few days my anxiety has been through the roof my meds that i take when i need help are doing jack all and i just cant wind down a close friend has just had a cancer diagnosis my foot is stuffed and im seeing a surgeon tomorrow for a consult and i have surgery for a separate issue on wednesday tried playing relaxation music cant go for a walk or have a bath as my leg is in a casthelp if been suicidal in the past and planning my own death but this is worse thanks miss kitty i wrote out a reply but for some reason it didnt post  im happy to feel the fear during the day but its at night that i cant cope im really struggling at the minute im soo fragile at the minute hi miss kitty   i see a psychiatrist for therapy twice a week its expensive but keeps me alivedepression i had come off antidepressant meds in jan and have seroquel to take when waves of anxiety or suicidal thoughts overwhelm me my pdoc wants me to go back on antids   ive doubled my dose of seroquel with my docs permissionnow 50mgs so its quite a small dose in the scheme of things i had full bloods done last week so we shall see how i am concerned about blood sugar and liver  i have a relaxation cd on my mp3 player so i hope that keeps me calm if i listen to it after taking meds with my physical injuries im in extreme pain and have a cam walkermoon boot and crutches just to get around the house over it hi   my psychiatrist is a rare breed therapy and then only meds if absolutely needed hes not script happy i had to ask him for meds  the physical stuff is causing me great stress as i may need surgery  my gp fu up my diagnosis feel a bit calmer tonight as i have my eating disorder a bit more in control  ive been good for 11 days and ive just planned all my meals for the week my husband was peeved that all the shopping was healthy but he made a trip for crisps today my favorite ones and i didnt eat any  just really scared that ill fall off the wagon and when i do the weight piles on sarah   im really sorry this has happened to you particularly at this difficult time a hug for comfort should never make a person uncomfortable touching you on your bum is downright wrong the fact that hes tried something before just takes him to a whole new level of wrong even if you were not in a relationship it would still be wrong as he was trying to take advantage when you were vulnerable  also it is perfectly natural to freeze in such circumstances i know someone irl who reacted exactly the same way so plz dont be hard on yourself you are not to blame in any way i would distance yourself as much as possible from this person  we are all here for you\n",
